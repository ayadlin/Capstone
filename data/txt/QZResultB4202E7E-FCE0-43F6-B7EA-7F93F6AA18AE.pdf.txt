BACKGROUND: Gefitinib was compared with pemetrexed as second-line therapy in a clinically selected population previously treated
with platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: A phase 3 trial of gefitinib (250 mg/day) versus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on day 1,
every 3 weeks) was conducted in patients who had never smoked and who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma treated with 1
previous platinum-based regimen. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were
analyzed. The gefitinib group had significantly longer PFS compared with the pemetrexed group, with a median PFS time of 9.0 versus 3.0 months (P ¼ .0006). The objective response rates were 58.8% and 22.4% for gefitinib and pemetrexed, respectively (P <
.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the 2 groups (22.2 vs 18.9 months; P ¼ .37).
The difference of PFS was increased in a subgroup analysis of 33 patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutation
(15.7 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.72; P ¼ .005), with numerical superiority of gefitinib in the 38
patients testing negative for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (5.9 vs 2.7 months; P ¼ .099). Both regimens were well tolerated. There were no significantly different changes in quality of life between the 2 groups, except that symptom scores for dyspnea
and diarrhea favored the gefitinib and pemetrexed arms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib showed superior efficacy to pemeC 2012 American

Inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, have been shown to
prolong progression-free survival (PFS) compared with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy when given as first-line therapy
in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor activating EGFR mutation (deletion in exon
19 or Leu858Arg [L858R] mutation in exon 21).1-5 Based on these data, first-line gefitinib was approved in March 2010
in Korea for the treatment of patients with NSCLC who harbor the EGFR mutation, because the therapeutic was initially
approved in 2003 for the treatment of advanced NSCLC after failure of previous chemotherapy.
In routine clinical practice, however, obtaining information on EGFR mutational status is not always feasible and
can be time-consuming for first-line gefitinib therapy. Therefore, many patients still receive first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy, with gefitinib sometimes reserved as second-line therapy, based on the previously demonstrated efficacy of
gefitinib as second-line therapy in unselected patients with NSCLC.6-8 In addition, none of the phase 3 studies have demonstrated an overall survival benefit of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy as

first-line therapy, which may possibly be attributed to the
cross-over in poststudy treatment in these studies, with
many patients initially randomized to chemotherapy
receiving EGFR TKIs as second-line therapy after disease
progression.
Gefitinib has been shown to be more effective in certain clinically selected populations, including patients
with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, never-smokers, or
patients of Asian origin. This phenomenon may be
because these populations are more likely to have tumors
harboring EGFR mutations.1,9-11 According to a recently
published study, positive rates for activating EGFR mutation was 75.0% in resected pulmonary adenocarcinoma
from East Asian never-smokers.11
Pemetrexed was also approved for the treatment of
advanced NSCLC after failure of prior platinum-based
chemotherapy, on the basis of results of a phase 3 trial that
showed this agent had a more tolerable toxicity profile
with noninferior efficacy compared with docetaxel.12
Interestingly, pemetrexed was more effective in patients
with pulmonary adenocarcinoma compared with those
with squamous cell carcinoma.12,13 The histotype-dependent activity of pemetrexed, combined with the fact
that adenocarcinoma itself is strongly associated with
EGFR mutation,9,10 suggests that patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who failed to improve with platinum-based chemotherapy are more likely to benefit from
gefitinib or pemetrexed.
On the basis of these observations, we conducted a
phase 3 trial to compare gefitinib with pemetrexed as second-line therapy in a clinically selected population
(never-smoker Korean patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma) who had previously received platinum-based
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial using the following eligibility criteria:
histologically or cytologically confirmed pulmonary adenocarcinoma that progressed after just 1 previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease;
never-smoker (a total of 100 cigarettes in their lifetime);
18 years or older; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2; measurable or evaluable disease; and adequate bone marrow,
renal, and hepatic function. Patients with prior EGFR
TKI or pemetrexed treatment, and symptomatic or
uncontrolled brain metastases were ineligible. The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of
Cancer

each institution, and all patients provided written
informed consent before treatment; separate consent for
assessment of EGFR gene mutation was obtained.

Study Design and Treatment Plan

Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive
either gefitinib or pemetrexed. Patients were consecutively
assigned to either the gefitinib arm or the pemetrexed arm
according to a predefined computer-generated randomization scheme developed by statisticians (S.J.J., J.W.L.).
Patient randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 or 1
vs 2) and sex (female vs male). Patients received either 250
mg/day of gefitinib orally (1 cycle for 21 days) or 500 mg/
m2 of pemetrexed as a 10-minute intravenous infusion on
day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles were repeated until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient or
the investigator requested therapy discontinuation. After
progression, cross-over to the alternative treatment regimen was recommended. Patients on the pemetrexed arm
received oral folic acid (1 mg) daily and a vitamin B12
injection (1000 lg) every 9 weeks, beginning 1 week
before the first dose and continuing until 3 weeks after the
last dose of study treatment. Patients on the pemetrexed
arm were prescribed to take dexamethasone (4 mg orally
twice daily the day before, the day of, and the day after
pemetrexed) as a prophylactic measure against skin rash.
The objective tumor response was assessed by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
every 2 cycles of therapy. The archived image scans were
also reviewed by the central review team to independently
assess the objective response rate. PFS was defined as the
time from randomization until documented progression
or death from any cause and was censored at the date of
the last follow-up visit for patients who were still alive and
who had not progressed. Overall survival was defined as
the time from the date of randomization to date of death
due to any cause. Patients who were alive on the date of
last follow-up were censored on that date. Toxicity evaluations were based on Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3. Quality of life was assessed at
baseline and then every 6 weeks with the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC
QLQ-C30).14
EGFR gene mutations were analyzed by direct gene
sequencing of exons 18 through 21 of chromosome 7, if
paraffin-embedded archival tumor tissue was available.
Tumors harboring in-frame deletion in exon 19 or the
exon 21 mutation L858R were regarded as positive for

EGFR mutation, because these mutations are most clearly
associated with TKI response.9,15
Statistical Analysis

The primary objective of the study was to compare PFS
between patients who received at least 1 dose of study
medication in the 2 treatment arms. Assuming that median PFS of the pemetrexed and gefitinib arms are 4
months and 6 months, respectively, PFS hazard ratio
would be 0.67. A total of 152 patients with PFS events
would provide 80% power to detect superiority of median
PFS of the gefitinib arm with a 0.05 one-sided significance by using a log-rank test. If an enrollment period is
set for 24 months and the last patient is followed for 6
months with a 10% patient drop-out rate, then 110
patients per arm are required. The log-rank test was used
to compare PFS and overall survival between the treatment arms. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess
the median time-to-event parameters. Planned subgroup
analyses were also performed to compare PFS between 2
treatment groups according to sex, age at randomization
(<65 years or 65 years), ECOG PS (0, 1, or 2), disease
stage at screening (stage IIIB or IV), and EGFR mutation
status (positive, negative, or unknown).
Secondary objectives were to compare overall survival, objective response rates, safety, and quality of life.
6236

The objective response rates were compared by using the
chi-square test. Regarding the analysis of quality of life,
we compared the changes in quality-of-life score from
baseline to the 6-week follow-up for each category
between the gefitinib and pemetrexed groups. Quality-oflife scores were also assessed for statistical significance by
analysis of covariance with baseline score as a covariate.
We also compared PFS for cross-over therapy, in which
PFS was defined as the time from the date of starting the
alternative treatment to the date of documented progression or death due to any cause. The cross-over analysis was
no longer a randomized comparison, but only the exploratory comparison. All reported P values are 2-sided except
for primary endpoint analysis.
This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01066195.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From July 2008 to June 2010, a total of 141 patients were
recruited and randomized from 18 centers in Korea. The
enrollment of patients was stopped early because of slow
enrollment rates after pemetrexed-cisplatin and gefitinib
were approved in Korea as first-line therapy in March
2010. Among 141 randomized patients, 135 patients

were actually treated with gefitinib (n ¼ 68) or pemetrexed (n ¼ 67), and it was a target population of analyses
for efficacy and safety (Fig. 1). Clinical data cutoff was
May 9, 2011. The treatment groups were well balanced
for baseline characteristics including sex, ECOG PS,
stage, and positive rates of EGFR mutation, with the
exception of age, which tended to be lower in the gefitinib
arm compared with the pemetrexed arm (Table 1). Most
patients were female (85%) and had an ECOG PS of 0 or
1 (91%).
Efficacy

The median follow-up was 15.9 months and a total of
114 disease progressions or deaths had occurred (52 and
62 in gefitinib and pemetrexed arms, respectively). The
median PFS for gefitinib was 9.0 versus 3.0 months for
pemetrexed (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.37-0.79; P ¼ .0006; 2-sided P ¼ .0013;
Fig. 2A). After adjusting for other clinical factors such as

age, sex, and ECOG PS, gefitinib was also superior to
pemetrexed for PFS with a HR of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.360.80). In subgroup analysis, the HR for PFS numerically
favored gefitinib therapy for most subgroups except for
males (Fig. 3).
The objective response rate of gefitinib therapy was
significantly higher than that of pemetrexed therapy
(58.8% vs 22.4%, P < .001). By the independent review,
the response rates of each arm were 45.6% and 28.4%,
respectively (P ¼ .038).
The median overall survival was 22.2 months and
18.9 in the gefitinib and pemetrexed arm, respectively,
and it was not significantly different (HR, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.50-1.30; P ¼ .37; Fig. 2B).

withdrawal, or other causes (Fig. 1). Among these, 41
(77.4%) and 57 patients (90.5%) received salvage systemic chemotherapy in the gefitinib and pemetrexed
arms, respectively. In addition, 37 of 53 patients (69.8%)
in the gefitinib arm and 41 of 63 patients (65.1%) in the
pemetrexed arm were crossed-over to either pemetrexed
or gefitinib, respectively, as third-line therapy. Although
we cannot determine which was better because of its nonrandomized nature, it showed that third-line gefitinib
therapy had longer PFS than third-line pemetrexed therapy (4.5 vs 2.7 months, respectively).

Safety

Table 2 lists the most common adverse events. Hematologic adverse events were rare in both the gefitinib and
pemetrexed arms, consistent with previous studies.6,12
According to our expectations, acneiform rash (45.6%),
pruritus (30.9%), and diarrhea (26.5%) were more frequently seen in the gefitinib arm compared with the
pemetrexed arm. However, grade 3/4 toxicities were
noted in less than 3% of patients in both arms. Serious
adverse events occurred in 19.1% of the patients treated
with gefitinib and 14.9% of the patients treated with
pemetrexed. There was 1 adverse event (interstitial pneumonitis) leading to study withdrawal in the gefitinib arm,
6238

but none in the pemetrexed arm. However, there was no
treatment-related death in either arm.
Quality of Life

A total of 132 patients (97.8%) answered the quality-oflife questionnaire at baseline, with paired data (both at
baseline and a 6-week follow-up) available for 118
patients (87.4%): 59 in the gefitinib and 59 in the pemetrexed arm, respectively. The comparison of quality-oflife was performed in these patients (Table 3).
Among the parameters of global health status
and functional scales, there was no significant difference between the 2 arms. Among the parameters of
symptom scales, there were significant improvements
in dyspnea (P ¼ .004) and worsening of diarrhea
scores (P ¼ .008) observed in the gefitinib arm compared with the pemetrexed arm. No other significant
differences in symptom scales were observed between
the 2 arms.
Exploratory Analysis According to EGFR
Mutation Status

Seventy-one of 135 patients (52.6%) were assessable for
EGFR gene mutation. Among these patients, 33 (46.5%)
were positive for EGFR gene mutation (n ¼ 19: deletion
in exon 19, n ¼ 14: L858R mutation). Seven patients had
rare types of EGFR mutation (S720F in exon 18, L861Q

DISCUSSION
Both gefitinib and pemetrexed are known to be effective
as second-line therapy for NSCLC. This study shows that
gefitinib is superior to pemetrexed as second-line therapy
for NSCLC in a clinically selected population of Korean
patients.
In this study, after failure of platinum-based firstline chemotherapy, gefitinib significantly prolonged PFS
and increased objective response rates compared with
pemetrexed therapy in Korean never-smokers with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However, the prolongation of
PFS in the gefitinib arm compared to the pemetrexed arm
did not translate into a survival difference. This may be
attributed to the fact that most patients (83.8%) received
additional treatment after protocol discontinuation,
which could offset the difference of PFS between 2
groups. Furthermore, 61.2% (41 of 67 patients) of the
pemetrexed arm received third-line therapy with gefitinib.
Given the high rates of poststudy treatment, the difference
of 3.3 months (22.2 vs 18.9 months) in overall survival
cannot be negligible in second-line therapy, even though
it was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in toxicity profiles between the 2 arms:
both gefitinib and pemetrexed were well tolerable as
shown previously in other studies.1-3,12 Although there
were no significantly different changes in most quality-oflife categories from baseline to 6 weeks after starting treatment in both arms, dyspnea improved and diarrhea worsened more in the gefitinib arm compared with the
pemetrexed arm. Given the prolonged PFS, tolerable toxicity, and no deterioration of quality of life in gefitinib
arm, it suggests that gefitinib can be considered prior to
pemetrexed in a clinically selected population after failure
of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
The distribution of EGFR mutation status was well
balanced between the 2 groups in our study, even though
patients were not randomized according to EGFR mutation status. It implies that the superior efficacy of gefitinib
was less likely caused by the skewed distribution of genetic
characteristics between arms. In addition, the superiority
of gefitinib was verified again by the cross-over analysis,
where third-line gefitinib therapy also showed superior efficacy to third-line pemetrexed when 2 drugs were administered to patients in the opposite arms. However, we

should be cautious in the interpretation of the cross-over
analysis, because it was not a randomized comparison.
It is notable that the efficacy of gefitinib therapy in a
subgroup of individuals who were negative for EGFR
mutation was better than expected, given the results of the
IPASS (Iressa Pan-Asia Study) trial (response rates of
1.1%). A possible explanation is the difference of method
for detecting EGFR mutations between 2 studies. We
used direct sequencing, which is regarded as less sensitive
than the ARMS (amplification-refractory mutation system) method, which was used in the IPASS trial.1,16 Even
though clinical characteristics of the population between
2 studies were very similar, except that IPASS also
included approximately 6% of former light smokers, the
proportion of patients with deletion in exon 19 or L858R
mutation was 46.5% in our study, which was lower than
the positive rate (57.4%) in the IPASS study. In addition,
according to another study performed with surgical specimens, activating the EGFR mutation was observed in
75.0% of resected pulmonary adenocarcinoma from
Asian patients who have never smoked.11 Therefore,
many tumors regarded as negative for EGFR mutation in
our study could turn out to be positive with the more sensitive technique. This explanation is supported by similar
results of a molecular study from another Korean clinical
trial (First-SIGNAL), which enrolled never-smokers with
pulmonary adenocarcinoma and evaluated EGFR mutation with direct sequencing: among 96 evaluable cases for
EGFR mutation analysis, 54 (56.2%) were negative for
EGFR mutation, and the response rates of this group was
25.6%, which was consistent with our results.17 Therefore, these 2 Korean studies, as well as ours, signify the importance of considering sensitivity of EGFR mutation
tests when interpreting EGFR mutation results.
During the study period, pemetrexed-cisplatin and
gefitinib were approved as first-line therapy for a selective
NSCLC population in Korea, and it lead to early closure
of this study. Nevertheless, this study is notable because it
is a well-designed phase 3 trial and met the primary endpoint. Although both pemetrexed and gefitinib are considered good therapeutic options as first-line therapy,
these 2 agents are also widely used as second-line therapy
because of several practical reasons: insufficient specimens
for performing EGFR mutation test; no time to wait for
data on EGFR mutation or waiting for 1 to 2 weeks of
vitamin premedication before pemetrexed therapy, especially in symptomatic or rapidly progressing patients; and
finally, the belief of the clinical relevance of pemetrexed
and gefitinib as second-line therapy by treating physician
in terms of patient survival.

In the subgroup analysis, males were less likely to
benefit from gefitinib than pemetrexed. Although definitive conclusions cannot be made due to the small number
(n ¼ 20) of male patients in our study, some plausible
explanations can be suggested. There is a study supporting
the reverse relationship between rates of positive EGFR
mutation and males: rates of positive EGFR mutation in
men were lower than those in women (63.6% vs 82.9%),
even among never-smoker Asian patients with pulmonary
adenocarcinoma.11
Although EGFR mutation status is the strong predictive factor for therapy with EGFR TKIs, it is not so
easy to obtain sufficient tumor specimen for EGFR mutation analysis. Only approximately half of our patients
were successfully analyzed for EGFR mutation, even
though we made much effort. The testing rates for EGFR
mutation across East Asian nonsquamous patients is
thought to be similar to our results,18 which implies that
the therapeutic decision should be made without genotype information in at least 50% of patients with NSCLC.
In that sense, it is important that regimen be selected as
second-line therapy without knowing EGFR mutation
status, especially in a clinically enriched population. The
present data might influence this decision. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting our results,
because the study population was confined to patients
whose tumoral EGFR mutation statuses have not been
tested by more sensitive EGFR mutation testing such as
the amplification-refractory mutation system or the peptide nucleic acid–locked nucleic acid PCR clamp method.
In summary, this study shows that second-line therapy with gefitinib compared with pemetrexed prolonged
PFS and increased objective response rates without deterioration of quality of life in clinically selected patients with
NSCLC.
