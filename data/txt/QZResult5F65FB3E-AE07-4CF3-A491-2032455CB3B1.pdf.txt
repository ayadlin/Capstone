Abstract
The cell-cycle G2–M phase gene UBE2C is overexpressed in various solid tumors including castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). Our recent studies found UBE2C to be a CRPC-specific androgen receptor (AR) target
gene that is necessary for CRPC growth, providing a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention. In this
study, we showed that the G1–S cell-cycle inhibitor-779 (CCI-779), an mTOR inhibitor, inhibited UBE2C mRNA
and protein expression in AR-positive CRPC cell models abl and C4-2B. Treatment with CCI-779 significantly
decreased abl cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of cell-cycle progression of both G2–M and
G1–S phases. In addition, exposure of abl and C4-2B cells to CCI-779 also decreased UBE2C-dependent cell
invasion. The molecular mechanisms for CCI-779 inhibition of UBE2C gene expression involved a decreased
binding of AR coactivators SRC1, SRC3, p300, and MED1 to the UBE2C enhancers, leading to a reduction in RNA
polymerase II loading to the UBE2C promoter, and attenuation of UBE2C mRNA stability. Our data suggest that,
in addition to its ability to block cell-cycle G1 to S-phase transition, CCI-779 causes a cell-cycle G2–M
accumulation and an inhibition of cell invasion through a novel UBE2C-dependent mechanism, which
contributes to antitumor activities of CCI-779 in UBE2C overexpressed AR-positive CRPC. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, is expressed in both androgen-dependent prostate
cancer (ADPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC; refs. 1, 2). One important function of AR in prostate
cancer is to drive cell-cycle progression (3). Although it is well
known that AR mainly regulates cell-cycle G1 to S-phase
transition in ADPC through AR-dependent regulation of
CCND1, p21, and p27 (3), recent integrated analysis of AR
cistrome and gene expression data in prostate cancer found
that AR selectively binds to the enhancers of G2–M phase
genes in CRPC but not in ADPC, leading to higher G2–M phase

gene expression and accelerated cell-cycle G2–M progression
in CRPC versus ADPC (4, 5).
One of such AR-regulated G2–M phase genes in CRPC is
UBE2C, a gene whose translation product is an anaphasepromoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-specific E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (6). Significantly, UBE2C mRNA and
protein expression levels are overexpressed in CRPC cases
(4, 7, 8). Consistent with the essential role of UBE2C in driving
M-phase cell-cycle progression by inactivating the M phase
checkpoint (9) or increasing the pool of active APC/C (10),
silencing of UBE2C in CRPC cells arrests cell cycle in G2–M
phase and decreases CRPC cell proliferation, suggesting that
UBE2C is a potential therapeutic target in CRPC (4).
In this study, we screened several clinically active compounds for their ability to decrease UBE2C expression. CCI779 (cell-cycle inhibitor-779; temsirolimus), an ester analogue
of mTOR inhibitor rapamycin currently under clinical evaluation (11), emerged from screening to have significant efficacy
and potency in inhibition of UBE2C protein and mRNA
expression in AR-positive CRPC cell lines abl and C4-2B.
Although previous studies found that mTOR inhibitors,
including CCI-779, decrease the growth of cancer cell lines
(e.g., AR-negative CRPC cell lines PC-3 and DU-145) via G1 to Sphase inhibition (12, 13), we show that CCI-779 inhibits the abl
in vitro and in vivo growth by blocking both cell-cycle G2–M
and G1–S transitions. Consistent with the newly identified
role of UBE2C in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis

CCI-779 Is an Inhibitor of G2–M Phase Gene UBE2C in CRPC

(14–16), we found that CCI-779 treatment decreases UBE2Cdependent cell invasion of abl and C4-2B cells. Finally,
we found that the combined effects on attenuating UBE2C
transcription and mRNA stability of CCI-779 lead to decreased
mRNA levels of UBE2C. Collectively, this study identifies CCI779 as a UBE2C inhibitor in CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture
CCI-779 (temsirolimus) was purchased from LC Laboratories. LNCaP cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and C4-2B cells were purchased
from ViroMed Laboratories. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% FBS and authenticated by the suppliers. abl cells,
an androgen-independent derivative of the LNCaP cell line,
were kindly provided by Zoran Culig (Innsbruck Medical
University, Innsbruck, Austria) and authenticated by Culig
Laboratory, using AR sequence analysis, cytogenetic analysis, and comparative genome hybridization analysis (17).
The abl cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. All 3 cell lines were passaged in our laboratory for less than 6 months after
resuscitation.
Western blot
Cells or tumor tissues were collected and lysed as previously
described (18). The total lysate sample (50 mg per lane) was
resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with primary
antibodies. Antibodies against various proteins were purchased from the following sources: anti-UBE2C (A650) from
Boston Biochem; anti-AR (441), anti-GATA2 (H116), anti-SRC1
(M341), anti-p300 (C20), and anti-MED1 (M255) from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; anti-CCND1 (ab24249) and anti-FoxA1
(ab23738) from Abcam; anti-calnexin from Stressgen, and
anti-b-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. An anti-SRC3 antibody has
been described previously (19).
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
was conducted on 100 ng of RNA by using MultiScribe Reverse
Transcriptase and SYBR Green PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following
primers were used: UBE2C (50 -TGGTCTGCCCTGTATGATGT30 and 50 -AAAAGCTGTGGGGTTTTTCC-30 ; ref. 20); CCND1
(50 -TCCTCTCCAAAATGCCAGAG-30 and 50 -GGCGGATTGGAAATGAACTT-30 ), GAPDH (50 -TCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC-30 and 50 -TCGCCCCACTTGATTTTGG -30 ; ref. 19), and actin
(50 -AGGCACCAGGGCGTGAT-30 and 50 -GCCCACATAGGAATCCTTCTGAC-30 ; ref. 21).
RNA interference
ON-TARGETplus siRNAs targeting CCND1 and UBE2C
(siCCND1 and siUBE2C) and ON-TARGETplus control siRNA
(siControl) were purchased from Dharmacon. siRNAs were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Synchronization and fluorescence-activated cellsorting analysis
Cells were arrested in G2–M phase by using a thymidine–
nocodazole block as previously described (22). Briefly, cells
were first synchronized by arresting them at the G1–S border
with 2 mmol/L thymidine for 24 hours, followed by a 4-hour
release and then cells were arrested at M phase with 100 ng/
mL nocodazole for 12 hours. CCI-779 (50 nmol/L) or vehicle
control was added at the same time as nocodazole. The cells
were released from the nocodazole block with 2 washes of
fresh medium and allowed to progress to G1 phase. Cells were
collected after the release (2 hours for abl cells, 1 hour for
C4-2B cells, and 1.5 hours for LNCaP cells), stained with
propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) and subjected to analysis by
using a FACSCalibur cell flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences). Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis was also done on unsynchronized cells after 13 hours of
exposure to 50 nmol/L CCI-779.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was measured by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-lodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) assay according to the manufacturer's instruction
(Roche). Briefly, this assay entails the addition of 10 mL
WST-1 reagents per 100 mL cell cultures in a 96-well plate.
These cultures were incubated for 30 minutes and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined by an ELISA Microplate
Reader (Bio-Rad).
Xenograft model
Male, 6-week-old, Balb/c athymic nude mice were obtained
from Charles River Laboratory and acclimated for 1 week in a
pathogen-free enclosure before start of study. All experiments
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care International (AAALAC). abl cells (2  106 cells/
flank) were suspended in 50% Matrigel (Becton Dickinson)
and subcutaneously inoculated bilaterally into the flanks of
mice, monitored daily, and tumor size was quantified with
calipers twice a week (17, 23). When tumors had grown to 100
mm3, treatments were initiated. Mice were randomly assigned
into 2 cohorts with 10 mice per group. CCI-779 (treated group)
or vehicle solution [5% Tween 80 (Sigma) and 5% polyethylene
glycol 400 (Sigma); ref. 13; control group] was given intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the dose of 10 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days per
week (24). The injection volume was 0.1 mL/10 g body weight.
Tumor volume was calculated by using the standard formula: V
¼ length  width2  0.5. Body weight was also monitored
biweekly. After 4 weeks, mice were euthanized and tumor
tissues were weighed and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Transfection and invasion assay
Cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with siUBE2C
or siControl, or 2 mg of pCS2-myc-UBE2C (kindly provided by
Michael Rape, University of California, Berkeley) or a control
pCS2-myc vector (a gift from David Turner, University of
Michigan), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight
hours after transfection, 4  105 cells were seeded on the

Matrigel-coated filters (BD BioCoat BD Matrigel Invasion
Chamber; Becton Dickinson) in the upper chamber, which
was filled with media containing 0.1% FBS. The lower chamber
was filled with media supplemented with 10% FBS. Both
chambers were treated with 50 nmol/L CCI-779 or vehicle.
The cells were allowed to invade for 48 hours. The cells on the
underside of the filter were then fixed with 80% methanol,
stained with 0.3% crystal violet, and counted using a light
microscope. The invasion results were normalized by cell
proliferation under the same treatment conditions.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ReChIP
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was done as previously described (19). The antibodies used were: anti-AR
(N20), anti-GATA2 (H116), anti-SRC1 (M341), anti-SRC3,
anti-p300 (C20), anti-MED1 (M255) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-FoxA1 (ab23738) from Abcam; and anti-RNA pol
II (8WG16) from Covance. SRC3 ChIP was done with SRC3
antibodies as previously described (19). The ChIP-enriched
DNA was then quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using
specific primers for the UBE2C enhancers 1 and 2 (4) and the
UBE2C promoter, respectively. Negative controls used were
sequences containing androgen-responsive elements (ARE)
that do not have actual binding to AR and FoxA1 (4). The
primer sequences used in ChIP assay were as follows: UBE2C
enhancer 1 (50 -TGCCTCTGAGTAGGAACAGGTAAGT-30 and
50 -TGCTTTTTCCATCATGGCAG-30 ; ref. 4); UBE2C enhancer 2
(50 -CCACAAACTCTTCTCAGCTGGG-30 and 50 -TTCTTTCCTTCCCTGTTACCCC-30 ; ref. 4); UBE2C promoter (50 -GCCCGAGGGAAATTGGAT-30 and 50 -TTACTCCGCGTGGGAACACT-30 ); control ARE region 1 (50 -CACAGAATCAGTCTAGGGTGCTCTT-30 and 50 -CTGCATGCTCAAGGAGTGTGTT-30 ; ref. 4), and control ARE region 2 (50 -GCTGATTCAATTACCTCCCAGAA-30 and AGTTTGGGACAGACGGGAAA-30 ; ref. 4). ReChIP assays were carried out as previously
described (25).
mRNA stability assay
abl cells were treated with 50 nmol/L CCI-779 or vehicle.
Simultaneously, 5 mg/mL actinomycin D (Sigma) was used to
block mRNA synthesis. Cells were collected at various time
points (0, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 hours) after treatment and UBE2C
mRNA level was quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The t1/2 was calculated using the iterative
curve-fitting software SigmaPlot (SPSS) by fitting 4-parameter
exponential decay curves described by the formula y ¼ a* exp
[b/(c* x þ d)]. Estimations of c, designated as C, and corresponding standard errors, designated as SE(C), were used to
calculate standard error (t1/2 ¼ log(2)/C). t1/2  SE(t1/2) was
calculated as follows: log(2)/[C þ SE(C)], log(2)/[C  SE(C)].

Results
CCI-779 downregulates UBE2C protein and mRNA
expression levels in CRPC and ADPC cells
Our initial compound screenings for identification of
UBE2C inhibitors were carried out on abl cells. As a CRPC
cell model, abl mimics the clinical properties of a significant

4868

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

proportion of CRPC cases. For example, recent studies reporting that AR upregulates cell-cycle genes (e.g., UBE2C, CDC20,
and CDK1) in abl cells mimic the pattern of upregulated genes
observed in human CRPC versus ADPC cases (4, 7, 8). CCI-779
emerged from screening because it potently decreased both
protein and mRNA levels of UBE2C in abl cells (Fig. 1A and B).
We further extended our study to another CRPC cell model
C4-2B that overexpresses the AR (26). We confirmed that
UBE2C protein and mRNA levels were significantly decreased
in CCI-779–treated C4-2B cells (Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly,
the inhibitory effect of CCI-779 on UBE2C protein and mRNA
levels was also seen in an ADPC cell line LNCaP, although the
effect was less effective than that observed in abl and C4-2B
cells (Fig. 1A and B). Consistent with previous studies showing
that the mTOR pathway is required for translation of mRNAs
of critical G1 phase cell-cycle genes such as CCND1 (12), we
found that treatment of abl, C4-2B, and LNCaP cells with CCI779 significantly reduced CCND1 protein, but not mRNA,
expression level (Fig. 1A and B). Thus, CCI-779 decreases
protein expression levels of both UBE2C and CCND1, as well
as UBE2C mRNA expression level in prostate cancer cells.
To further investigate whether CCI-779–mediated decrease
in UBE2C mRNA expression was dependent on CCI-779–
induced reduction in CCND1 protein expression, we examined
the effect of CCI-779 on UBE2C mRNA level in CCND1silenced and control-silenced abl cells. Silencing of CCND1
caused a complete cell-cycle G1 arrest, which was barely
enhanced by CCI-779 treatment (Fig. 1C and D). Significantly,
treatment of abl cells with CCI-779 decreased UBE2C mRNA
level in abl cells already arrested in G1 phase (Fig. 1D). These
results indicate that CCI-779 can directly decrease UBE2C
mRNA expression in a CCND1 expression and G1 arrest
independent manner. We obtained essentially similar results
in C4-2B cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
CCI-779 blocks both G2–M and G1–S cell-cycle
progression and decreases cell proliferation in CRPC
and ADPC cells
Because UBE2C plays an essential role in promoting G2–M
phase cell-cycle progression in prostate cancer cells (4) and
CCI-779 inhibited UBE2C expression (Fig. 1), we next examined
the effect of CCI-779 on G2–M phase cell-cycle progression. abl,
C4-2B, and LNCaP cells were synchronized to G2–M phase by
using a thymidine–nocodazole block and then released for 1 to
2 hours. As shown in Figure 2A, whereas treatment of cells with
CCI-779 had no effect on G2–M synchronization, CCI-779
treatment led to an increase in the G2–M phase and a decrease
in the G1 phase after releasing from G2–M synchronization,
suggesting that CCI-779 markedly delayed G2–M to G1 transition in all 3 cell lines. Consistent with the functional role of CCI779 in decreasing CCND1 protein expression level (Fig. 1A) and
a recent study showing that CCI-779 arrests prostate and
breast cancer cells in G1 phase (24), CCI-779 blocked unsynchronized abl, C4-2B, and LNCaP cells in G1 phase (Fig. 2B).
The inhibition of CCI-779 on G2–M and G1–S cell-cycle progression was correlated with a significantly decreased cell
proliferation of abl, C4-2B, and LNCaP (but more notably
abl and C4-2B cells; Fig. 2C).

Figure 1. Effects of CCI-779 on UBE2C and CCND1 expression in CRPC and ADPC cells. A, CCI-779 downregulates protein expression levels of UBE2C and
CCND1 in abl, C4-2B, and LNCaP cell lines. Cells were treated with 50 nmol/L CCI-779 or vehicle for 24 hours and Western blot analyses were carried
out with indicated antibodies. B, CCI-779 decreases mRNA expression level of UBE2C but not CCND1. Cells were incubated with 50 nmol/L CCI-779
for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by qRT-PCR, using gene-specific primers. The results represent mean  SE of 3 experiments conducted in
triplicate. ***, P < 0.001 as compared with the vehicle control. C, silencing of CCND1 decreases CCND1 protein expression in abl cells, which were
transfected with siControl or siCCND1. Western blot analyses were carried out 48 hours after transfection, using the indicated antibodies. D, CCI-779
decreases UBE2C mRNA expression in both siControl- and siCCND1-transfected abl cells. Top, FACS analyses were carried out using siControl- or
siCCND1-transfected abl cells treated with CCI-779 or vehicle for 24 hours. Cell number (%) in each cell-cycle phase is indicated in the graph. Bottom, total
RNA was isolated from siControl- or siCCND1-transfected abl cells treated with CCI-779 or vehicle for 24 hours. qRT-PCR was then conducted using
UBE2C-specific primers. ***, P < 0.001 as compared with the vehicle control.

To further delineate the role of UBE2C in CCI-779–
mediated inhibition of CRPC cell proliferation, the effects
of CCI-779 on cell proliferation of UBE2C-silenced or control-silenced abl and C4-2B cells were examined. The inhibitory effect of CCI-779 on abl cell proliferation was markedly
decreased in UBE2C-silenced (28%) versus control-silenced
(45%) abl cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that UBE2C-silencing–
mediated abl cell growth inhibition (Fig. 2D) significantly
contributes to growth-inhibitory effect of CCI-779 on abl
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, as UBE2C silencing only slightly
decreased C4-2B cell proliferation (Fig. 2D), CCI-779–
mediated inhibition of C4-2B cell proliferation (Fig. 2C) was
presumed to be mostly due to CCI-779–induced decreased

expression of CCND1 rather than UBE2C in C4-2B cells (Figs.
1A and 2D).
CCI-779 inhibits in vivo growth of abl xenograft through
downregulation of UBE2C and CCND1
We further extended our studies to an in vivo xenograft
model to validate the significance of our in vitro findings.
Approximately 2 weeks after the inoculation of abl cells, mice
were treated with CCI-779 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 consecutive
days weekly for 4 weeks. Mice generally tolerated CCI-779
without showing any apparent toxicity throughout the experiment. No significant difference in body weight was observed
between groups after the 4-week period (data not shown).

Figure 2. Effects of CCI-779 on CRPC and ADPC cell-cycle progression and cell proliferation. A, CCI-779 delays cell-cycle G2–M to G1 phase transition. FACS
analyses were carried out using cells released from thymidine–nocodazole block in the presence or absence of CCI-779 (50 nmol/L). Cell number (%)
in each cell-cycle phase is indicated in the graph. B, CCI-779 arrests unsynchronized cells in G1 phase. Thirteen hours after exposure of cells to 50 nmol/L
CCI-779, FACS analyses were carried out. C, CCI-779 inhibits cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was determined by WST-1 assay on the indicated days
(0, 2, 4, and 6) in the absence or presence of CCI-779 (50 nmol/L). The data are presented as a percentage of the cell number on day 0. The results

Remarkably, the tumor growth was inhibited by CCI-779 even
after 1 week of treatment. By the end of the study, the tumor
volume dramatically decreased from 234  33 mm3 in control
group to 57  4 mm3 in CCI-779–treated group (Fig. 3A and
B). In addition, there was no measurable tumor in 4 of 10 CCI779–treated mice. Tumor weight measurement further supported our findings, as the average value was 78.6  15.5 mg
for control group as compared with 13.5  2.5 mg for the CCI779 group (Fig. 3C). More importantly, Western blot analysis
confirmed that levels of both UBE2C and CCND1 protein were
significantly decreased in tumor tissues following treatment
with CCI-779 (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that CCI-779

Figure 3. CCI-779 inhibits in vivo CRPC tumor growth through downregulation of UBE2C and CCND1. A, CCI-779 inhibits the growth of subcutaneous abl
xenograft tumors in nude mice. abl cells (2  106/flank) were inoculated into both flanks of male Balb/c nude mice, and the treatments were initiated
when tumor size reached 100 mm3. The mice were i.p. injected with 10 mg/kg CCI-779 or the vehicle solution for 4 consecutive days every week for 4 weeks
(days 0–3; days 7–10; days 14–17; and days 21–24). Tumor volume was measured twice per week and normalized to the percentage of the initial

and overexpression decreases and increases invasiveness of a
human colon cancer cell line HT-29, respectively (14). To
investigate whether UBE2C expression affects abl, C4-2B,
and LNCaP cell invasion, we transfected a siRNA targeting
UBE2C (siUBE2C), a control siRNA (siControl), UBE2C vector,
or a control vector in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 4A) followed by
Matrigel invasion assays. Control vector- or siControl-transfected abl and C4-2B cells were significantly more invasive
than similarly transfected LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B and C; Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, silencing of UBE2C significantly decreased, whereas overexpression of UBE2C
significantly increased, invasiveness of abl and C4-2B but
not LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B and C; Supplementary Fig. S3),
suggesting that UBE2C is necessary for CRPC cell invasion
but not sufficient for ADPC cell invasion. It is possible that
additional invasion-related proteins are required for UBE2C to
mediate ADPC cell invasion. We next examined the effect of
CCI-779 on cell invasion. Exposure of control vector-transfected abl, C4-2B, and LNCaP cells to CCI-779 significantly
reduced invasion of abl and C4-2B but not LNCaP cells
(Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly, UBE2C overexpression reversed most of this CCI-779–induced invasion
inhibitory effect (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S3). These results

suggest that CCI-779–induced prevention of CRPC cell invasion is mediated mostly by UBE2C.
Mechanisms for CCI-779 inhibition on UBE2C mRNA
expression in CRPC cells
To investigate the underlying mechanisms for UBE2C
mRNA inhibition by CCI-779 in CRPC cells, we first examined
the effect of CCI-779 on recruitment of AR, its collaborating
transcription factors FoxA1 and GATA2 (25), and its coactivators histone acetyltransferases [(HAT); SRC1, SRC3, and
p300] and Mediator subunit (MED1; ref. 19) to the 2 UBE2C
enhancers located 32.8 and þ41.6 kilobases (kb) away from
the transcription start site (TSS) of UBE2C gene in abl cells (4).
abl cells were treated with CCI-779, and ChIP assays were
conducted using antibodies against AR, FoxA1, GATA2, SRC1,
SRC3, p300, MED1, and RNA polymerase II (pol II). Although
exposure to CCI-779 did not affect AR binding at the 2 UBE2C
enhancers, CCI-779 treatment decreased and increased
FoxA1/GATA2 recruitment to the UBE2C enhancers 1 and
2, respectively (Fig. 5A–Fig. 5C). Significantly, CCI-779 treatment attenuated the recruitment of AR coactivators SRC1,
SRC3, p300, and MED1 to both UBE2C enhancers but not the 2
negative control regions (Fig. 5D–Fig. 5G). Consistent with

and K), indicating that CCI-779 treatment reduces coactivator
binding through disruption of AR–coactivator interactions.
Taken together, these data suggest that CCI-779 decreases ARtranscription–complex loading on UBE2C regulatory regions,
which may account, at least in part, for the decreased UBE2C
mRNA expression after CCI-779 treatment.
We further addressed whether CCI-779 affects UBE2C
mRNA stability in CRPC cells. abl cells were incubated in
the presence of either actinomycin D (to block de novo transcription)/CCI-779 or actinomycin D/vehicle for 6 to 24 hours.
As shown in Figure 6, the UBE2C mRNA was destabilized by
CCI-779 with a t1/2 ¼ 8.52  0.19 hours, as compared with the
vehicle t1/2 ¼ 10.97  0.21 hours. These data suggest that both
attenuated gene transcription and mRNA stability contribute
to CCI-779 inhibition of UBE2C mRNA level in CRPC cells.

Discussion
The AR is often expressed and functional in most CRPC
patients, and current clinical studies on CRPC focus on targeting AR itself by using AR antagonists (e.g., MDV-3100; ref. 30) or
inhibitors of androgen synthesis (e.g., abiraterone acetate; ref.
31). Although these agents decrease CRPC growth in some
patients, elimination of all AR activity blocks some beneficial
actions of AR (e.g., inhibition of some oncogenes such as
PCDH11; ref. 32) and contributes to undesirable effects such
as bone loss (33) and metabolic syndrome (34). An alternative
approach for the inhibition of the cancer-promoting AR signaling pathway in CRPC is to target AR downstream target genes
involved in CRPC growth. Given our recent findings showing
that knocking down of CRPC-specific AR-target G2–M phase

genes (e.g., UBE2C, CDK1, and CDC20) significantly decreases
CRPC cell growth (4), we propose that G2–M phase genes could
serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention.
In this study, we identified the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 as
an inhibitor for UBE2C in CRPC cells. We showed that CCI-779
treatment significantly decreases UBE2C mRNA and protein
expression in CRPC cells at its pharmacologically attainable
concentrations in clinical trials (refs. 35, 36; Fig. 1). Although it
is well known that inhibition of mTOR decreases protein
expression levels of some genes by dephosphorylation of
p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) and the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; refs. 12, 37), recent
studies have found that mTOR inhibitors also decrease RNA
levels of some genes (37, 38) through a variety of mechanisms. It has been shown that rapamycin inhibits mitochondrial gene transcription by disruption of protein–protein
interactions between a transcription coactivator PGC-1a
and a transcription factor yin-yang 1 (YY1), resulting in
decreased recruitment of PGC-1a to the promoters of mitochondrial genes (39). Furthermore, rapamycin prevents
sterol regulatory-element–binding protein 1 (SREBP1) target
gene expression through inhibition of nuclear accumulation
of SREBP1 (40). Additionally, rapamycin blocks PPAR-g
protein expression leading to decreased PPAR-g target gene
expression (41). With regard to the mechanisms for CCI-779
inhibition of UBE2C mRNA level, while CCI-779 does not
affect AR binding and protein expression levels of AR and its
coactivators, CCI-779 inhibits the recruitment of AR coactivators to the UBE2C enhancers through disruption of AR–
coactivator interactions, leading to decreased pol II loading
on the UBE2C promoter (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we also found
that CCI-779 attenuates UBE2C mRNA stability (Fig. 6),
suggesting that CCI-779-induced direct downregulation of
UBE2C mRNA levels is caused by decreased UBE2C mRNA
transcription and stability.

Although mTOR inhibitors have shown great potential as
antitumor agents and CCI-779 has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first-line treatment in patients with advanced refractory renal cell cancer
(RCC; ref. 11), results from clinical studies on mTOR inhibitors
in CRPC have been somewhat disappointing. For example, it
was reported that that therapeutic response was observed in
only 17% to 25% CRPC patients treated with rapamycin alone
(42, 43). One of the explanations for such clinical observations
is that rapamycin and CCI-779 may activate AR target genes
such as PSA and KLK4 in cultured CRPC cells and xenografts,
leading to a decreased effect of mTOR inhibitors on inhibition
of cell proliferation (42, 44). However, as the AR target genes
examined in these studies (42, 44) are not directly relevant to
cell growth and invasion, it is not very clear that the failure of
mTOR inhibitors as monotherapy is caused by mTOR inhibitor-activated AR signaling. Interestingly, our studies found
that CCI-779 significantly decreases the expression of a CRPCspecific AR target gene UBE2C in CRPC cell models abl and C42B (Fig. 1). The overexpressed UBE2C in abl and C4-2B cells, as
compared with LNCaP cells (4), plays a critical role in cell
proliferation and/or invasion (Figs. 2–4; ref. 4). CCI-779, acting
partially through a UBE2C-dependent mechanism, significantly decreases abl cell growth in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2
and 3). Importantly, we also found that CCI-779–induced
inhibition of abl and C4-2B cell invasion is mediated mostly
by UBE2C (Fig. 4). Although the average level of UBE2C
expression in CRPC patients is significantly higher than that
in ADPC patients, UBE2C expression in CRPC cases is highly
variable (4). Thus, it is possible that those CRPC patients with
high UBE2C expression will have better therapeutic response
for CCI-779 than those with low UBE2C expression. Further
studies are needed to investigate whether UBE2C is able to
serve as a biomarker for predicting CCI-779 therapy response
in CRPC patients.
