ABSTRACT
There is an unmet need to develop new, more effective and safe therapies for
the aggressive forms of triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). While up to 20%
of women under 50 years of age with TNBC harbor germline mutations in BRCA1,
and these tumors are sensitive to treatment with poly(ADP) ribose polymerase
inhibitors, a majority of TNBCs lack BRCA1 mutations or loss of expression. Findings
presented here demonstrate that by attenuating the levels of DNA damage response
and homologous recombination proteins, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI)
treatment induces ‘BRCAness’ and sensitizes TNBC cells lacking BRCA1 to lethal effects
of PARP inhibitor or cisplatin. Treatment with HDI also induced hyperacetylation of
nuclear hsp90. Similar effects were observed following shRNA-mediated depletion
of HDAC3, confirming its role as the deacetylase for nuclear HSP90. Furthermore,
cotreatment with HDI and ABT-888 induced significantly more DNA strand breaks
than either agent alone, and synergistically induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Notably,
co-treatment with HDI and ABT-888 significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth and
markedly improved the survival of mice bearing TNBC cell xenografts. These findings
support the rationale to interrogate the clinical activity of this novel combination
against human TNBC, irrespective of its expression of mutant BRCA1.

INTRODUCTION

adducts and single strand breaks (SSBs), are repaired by
the base excision repair (BER) or nucleotide excision
repair (NER) mechanisms [1,2]. More substantial and
lethal DNA damage in the form of double strand breaks
are repaired either by the error prone non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) through direct ligation of the DSB ends in
the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, or by the homologous
recombination (HR) mechanism, which accurately restores

DNA damage is caused by exposure of cells to a
variety of agents, including environmental carcinogens,
reactive oxygen species from cellular metabolism, UV,
ionizing radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs that target
DNA [1,2]. Lesser and subtle forms of DNA damage,
such as oxidative lesions, alkylation of bases, DNA

the genomic sequence in the cell cycle S and G2 phases by
utilizing the sister chromatid as template for repair [1,2].
HR is mediated by BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD52 proteins
while NHEJ involves KU70/80, DNA-PK and DNA ligase
IV.
At the cellular level, DNA damage triggers the
DNA damage response (DDR), which consists of a
tightly coordinated signaling pathway, involving the
sensing of DNA damage, the assembly of DNA repair
factors, cell cycle transit arrest and DNA repair, all
designed to maintain genome stability [1-3]. Following
the recognition of DNA damage by the sensor proteins:
RPA (Replication Protein A) detecting SSBs and MRN
(MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex detecting the DSBs,
the PIKK (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases)
family members Ataxia Telangiectasia-and Rad3-related
(ATR) and ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase
are activated [1,4,5]. Activated ATR assembled at the
DNA lesion or stalled replication fork phosphorylates the
checkpoint protein 1 (CHK1), a serine/threonine kinase,
which is necessary for the activation of S and G2 cell cycle
checkpoint [1,4,5]. This inhibits cell cycle progression,
especially entry into mitosis [5]. ATR is also known to
phosphorylate BRCA1 and FANCD2, thereby regulating
not only cell cycle but also DNA repair [1,5]. Thus, a wellcoordinated interaction among the sensor and effector
DDR and DNA repair proteins orchestrates the repair of
DNA lesions [1]. Previous reports have demonstrated that
BRCA1, ATR and CHK1, but not ATM, are chaperoned
and stabilized by the heat shock protein (HSP) 90 [6,7].
Consistent with this, treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor
was shown to degrade and deplete expression of BRCA1,
ATR and CHK1, resulting in impairment of the DDR and
DNA repair, which sensitized breast cancer cells to DNA
damage [6,7]. Indeed, depletion and functional impairment
of DDR and HR proteins, including BRCA1, is well
documented to induce genome instability and defective
DNA repair, as well as to sensitize breast cancer cells to
DNA damaging agents [2,3,8,9].
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family
member PARP1 is a nuclear protein that also binds to
DNA strand breaks and nicks [10,11]. Following this,
it is catalytically activated, mediating the synthesis
of PAR polymers from NAD and causing poly(ADPribosylation of itself and other proteins to recruit DDR
factors involved in the DNA repair [2,10-12]. PARP1
binds to the DNA single strand breaks (SSB) during base
excision repair (BER) or to DNA double strand breaks
(DSB) [2,10-12]. SSBs encountered by the replication
fork generate DSBs, which require DNA repair through
HR [1-3]. PARP inhibition results in HR dependency for
repairing DNA DSBs [10-13]. Notably, several studies
have documented that cancer cells expressing BRCA1
mutation and defective DNA damage repair through HR
demonstrate synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition
[2,11,12]. However, PARP inhibitors also trap PARP1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and PARP2 to SSB, yielding PPARP-SSB complex that
exerts cytotoxicity [13]. Additionally, PARP inhibitors
also stimulate NHEJ, thereby inducing genomic instability
and lethality, while disabling NHEJ rescues from the
lethality of PARP inhibitor in cells lacking BRCA1 [14].
Thus alternative mechanisms may contribute to the lethal
activity of PARP inhibitor in cancer cells lacking BRCA1.
Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs),
which are defined by the lack of expression of
estrogen and progesterone receptors and of HER2 gene
amplification and overexpression, represent approximately
16% of all breast cancers but exhibit poor clinical outcome
due to aggressive biology and lack of effective therapies
[15]. As much as 20% of TNBCs in women under 50
years of age harbor germline BRCA1 mutation, and
these tumors exhibit DNA repair defects and greater
sensitivity to treatment with PARP inhibitors and platinum
chemotherapy [2,16-18]. Previous reports have also
demonstrated that the sporadic TNBC cells exhibiting
similar DNA repair defects, i.e., BRCAness, are also
sensitive to PARP inhibitors, cisplatin and other DNAdamaging chemotherapy [2,19,20]. Here, BRCAness may
be caused by DNA methylation and depletion of BRCA1
expression [21], or due to mutation or depletion of other
proteins involved in HR [22]. Based on this, clinical
trials of PARP inhibitor in TNBC, including olaparib and
veliparib, are ongoing [23].
In a previous report, we demonstrated that treatment
with a pan-HDAC inhibitor induces hyperacetylation of
HSP90 and disrupts its chaperone function, destabilizing
and promoting proteasomal degradation and depletion of
HSP90 client proteins in breast cancer cells [24]. Based
on this, in the present studies we determined whether
treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) vorinostat
(VS) and panobinostat (PS) induces hyperacetylation of the
nuclear HSP90 and causes depletion of the client DDR and
HR proteins, thereby conferring BRCAness and defective
DDR and HR in the TNBC cells that lack BRCA1
mutation. Additionally, here, we determined which of the
nuclear class I HDACs is mechanistically involved in deacetylating the nuclear HSP90 [25]. Concomitantly, we
also determined whether HDI mediated defective DDR
and HR would sensitize TNBC cells to the in vitro and in
vivo activity of PARP inhibitor. This approach was further
prompted by the previous observations that treatment with
HDI induces ROS and DNA damage, as well as lowers
the threshold for apoptosis by inducing the pro-death
members of the BCL2 family, e.g. BAX and BIM, while
simultaneously attenuating the pro-survival proteins e.g.
BCL-xL and MCL-1 [25,26]. Collectively, our findings
here demonstrate that co-treatment with HDI and PARP
inhibitor or cisplatin exerts synergistic lethality in TNBC
cells, which is associated with increased DNA damage
coupled with HDI-mediated depletion of DDR (ATR and
CHK1) and HR proteins (BRCA1 and RAD52) in TNBC
cells.

tail moments determined by the neutral comet assay as
well as by increase in the γ-H2AX levels (Figure 1B and
1C). We next evaluated whether PS-induced ROS was
mechanistically linked to PS mediated DNA damage. As
shown in Figure 1C and 1D, co-treatment with the free
radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated PSmediated induction of γ-H2AX and apoptosis in MCF7
cells, indicating that ROS contributes to PS-induced DNA
damage (p=0.026).

Treatment with panobinostat induces reactive
oxygen species and inhibits activation of DNA
damage responses
Previous reports have shown that HDAC inhibitorinduced cell death is associated with production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [27]. We first determined the effects
of treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor,
panobinostat (PS) on induction of ROS in breast cancer
cells. Figure 1A shows that treatment with PS dose-and
time-dependently induced ROS (~2 fold induction with 50
nM of PS) in the MCF7 cells. HDAC inhibitor-mediated
induction of ROS was associated with DNA damage and
DNA double strand breaks, as shown by the increased

Treatment with PS induces hyperacetylation of
nuclear and cytoplasmic hsp90 and inhibits the
chaperone association of ATR and CHK1 with

We had previously demonstrated that treatment with
PS induces hyperacetylation of hsp90, thereby inhibiting

Figure 1: Treatment with PS induces hyperacetylation of nuclear hsp90, disrupts chaperone interaction of hsp90 with
ATR and CHK1 and induces DNA damage and apoptosis of cancer cells. A. MCF7 cells were plated in 96 well plates and

incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, cells were treated with 50 nM of PS for 8 to 24 hours. At the end of treatment, the relative
reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using a microplate reader. As a positive control, cells were treated with 500 µM H2O2 for
4 hours. Post-treatment ROS levels were compared to control ROS levels and values represent the mean ± S.E.M from three independent
experiments. B. MCF7 cells were treated with 50 nM PS for 24 hours. At the end of treatment, cells were analyzed by neutral comet assay.
C. Immunoblot analyses of γ-H2AX and β-actin in the cell lysates from MCF7 cells treated with 50 nM PS and/or 500 µM N-acetyl cysteine

the % annexin V-positive apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry. E. HeLa cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged hsp90
(F-hsp90) and GFP-tagged CHK1 (GFP-CHK1) constructs for 24 hours. Following this, cells were treated with 50 nM PS for 24 hours. Cell
lysates were prepared and FLAG-hsp90 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. Immunoblot analyses were performed
for acetyl-lysine (Ac-K), ATR, GFP or FLAG. Alternatively, immunoblot analyses were performed for ATR, GFP-CHK1 and β-actin on
the total cell lysates. F. HeLa cells were treated with 50 nM PS for 24 hours. At the end of treatment, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
were prepared and immunoblot analyses were performed for acetyl lysine (K) 69 hsp90 (Ac-K69 hsp90), ATR, CHK1, and hsp90. The
expression levels of lamin B and α/β-tubulin served as the fraction and loading controls.

its chaperone association with its client proteins [24].
Further, treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 was
also demonstrated to disrupt the chaperone association
of hsp90 with ATR and CHK1, thereby depleting their
expression levels in breast cancer cells [6]. Collectively
based on these findings, we next determined the effects of
PS on the chaperone association of ATR and CHK1 with
hsp90. Figure 1E shows that in HeLa cells with ectopic
expression of FLAG-tagged hsp90 (FLAG-hsp90) and
GFP-tagged CHK1 (GFP-CHK1), treatment with PS
induced hyperacetylation of FLAG-hsp90 and inhibited
the binding of ATR and GFP-CHK1 to hsp90. We next
determined the effects of PS treatment on the acetylation
of hsp90 and expression levels of ATR and CHK1 in the

nucleus versus the cytoplasm. As shown in Figure 1F,
treatment with 50 nM of PS markedly induced acetylation
of hsp90 in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, which
was associated with depletion of CHK1 more than ATR
expression in the nucleus and the cytosolic fraction of
HeLa cells. In contrast, the expression levels of the total
hsp90, and the levels of the control proteins Lamin B
(nucleus) and α-tubulin (cytosol) were unaffected.

levels and induces apoptosis of TNBC cells

restored the levels of PS-mediated depletion of the levels
of the hsp90 client proteins, i.e., ATR, CHK1 and BRCA1.
Co-treatment with CZ also partially restored RAD52
expression levels. While CZ treatment alone had no effect
on the levels of Ku70, acetylated α-tubulin or acetylated
histone H3, co-treatment with CZ augmented PS-induced
γ-H2AX and acetylated histone H3 levels in HCC1937
more so than in SUM159T cells (Figure 3A and 3B).

We next determined the effects of treatment with the
PS or VS on the expression levels of the DNA damage
response and on the DNA repair proteins in the triple
negative breast cancer cells lines SUM159PT (BRCA1
wild-type) and HCC1937 (BRCA1 mutant). As shown in
Figure 2A and 2B, treatment with clinically achievable,
biologically active concentrations of PS and VS depleted
the expression levels of ATR and CHK1, as well as, of
the HR proteins BRCA1 and RAD52 in the two cell
lines. Notably, while treatment with PS attenuated mutant
BRCA1 similar to un-mutated BRCA1, PS had no effect
on the levels of the NHEJ proteins KU70 and DNA-PKcs.
As previously reported, treatment with the pan-HDAC
inhibitor VS or PS concomitantly increased the levels of
γ-H2AX and induced the acetylation of histone H3 and
α-tubulin [28], while simultaneously depleting the levels
of c-RAF in SUM159PT and HCC1937 cells. Figure 2C
demonstrates that treatment with PS also induced the
hyperacetylation of hsp90, and concomitantly inhibited
the chaperone association of hsp90 with its client proteins
BRCA1 in SUM159PT cells (Figure 2C). Treatment
with VS or PS dose-dependently induced apoptosis in
HCC1937 and SUM159PT cells, although HCC1937
cells were more sensitive to the lethal effects of PS
(Figure 2D). We next confirmed that, following HDAC
inhibitor treatment, the reduced chaperone association
with hsp90 leads to proteasomal degradation and depletion
of the client proteins. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CZ),

Depletion of HDAC3 induces hyperacetylation of
nuclear hsp90 that leads to depletion of its client
DDR and HR proteins
We had previously demonstrated that the class
IIB HDAC6, which is predominantly in the cytosol, is
the deacetylase for the predominantly cytosolic hsp90.
Therefore, we next determined which among the class
I HDACs is responsible for de-acetylating the smaller
nuclear fraction of hsp90, such that its inhibition by PS or
VS would lead to hyperacetylation of the nuclear hsp90,
resulting in destabilization of the chaperone association
of hsp90 with the DDR and HR proteins in the nucleus.
Therefore, we determined the effects of HDAC 1, 2, or 3
knockdown by shRNA on the acetylation status of nuclear
hsp90. In HeLa cells, following transient transfection,
the shRNA to HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 depleted
the mRNA, as well as attenuated the proteins levels of
HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC3 in the nucleus not in the
cytoplasm, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1A, 1B
and 1C). Notably, it was only the depletion of HDAC3 in
the nucleus that induced the hyperacetylation of nuclear
hsp90, demonstrated in the hsp90 immunoprecipitates
from the nuclear fraction followed by immunoblot

Following this, cell lysates were prepared and immunoblot analyses were performed for the expression levels of BRCA1, ATR, CHK1,
RAD52, KU70, γ-H2AX, acetylated α-tubulin, acetylated histone H3 and β-actin in the cell lysates. The numbers underneath the bands

of the levels of DDR and HR proteins

analyses with the anti-acetyl lysine antibody, or by the
immunoblot analyses of the nuclear extracts utilizing the
acetylated K69-hsp90 antibody. (Supplemental Figure
1B). Importantly, the shRNA-mediated depletion of
HDAC3 reduced the protein levels of ATR but not of
ATRIP, which is a co-activator of ATR (Figure 4A and
Supplemental Figure 1C) [1,4,5]. The shRNA-mediated
depletion of HDAC3 also reduced the levels of p-ATR
and p-CHK1 in HeLa cells, indicating that HDAC3
depletion inhibits the ATR-CHK1 pathway in cancer cells
(Figure 4A). As previously observed with HDAC inhibitor
treatment, shRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC3 caused
a significant (approximately 4-fold) up-regulation of the
DNA damage marker γ-H2AX in cancer cells (Figure
4A). Unlike the effect of PS treatment, shRNA mediated
knockdown of HDAC3 alone increased the levels of
CHK1 in HeLa cells (Supplemental Figure 1C).

Next, utilizing the Hdac3 knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (Hdac3FL/+-Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/-Cre-ER+ MEFs) [29, 30], we further confirmed the effects
of genetic knockdown of HDAC3 on the acetylation of
nuclear hsp90 and on the expression of the DDR and
HR proteins. As shown in Figure 4B, compared to the
Hdac3+/+ MEFs, Hdac3-/- MEF cells exhibited absence
of HDAC3, as determined by immunofluorescence
microscopy following staining with anti-HDAC3
antibody. Additionally, in the hsp90 immunoprecipitates
from the nuclear but not the cytoplasmic fractions of
Hdac3-/- MEFs, higher levels of hyperacetylated hsp90
were noted; the levels of lamin B and tubulin served as
the controls for the purity of the fractions (Figure 4C).
Similar to cancer cells in which HDAC3 was depleted by

Figure 4: Knockdown of HDAC3 by shRNA or genetic deletion of Hdac3 induces hyperacetylation of nuclear hsp90

and -actin in the lysates. B. Hdac3FL/+-Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/--Cre-ER+ MEFs were plated on a chamber slide and incubated overnight at
37°C. The next day, cells were treated with 1 µM tamoxifen for 72 hours. Following this, cells were stained with anti-HDAC3 antibodies
and imaged by confocal immunoflourescent microscopy. The scale bar represents 10 µm. C. Hdac3FL/+-Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/--Cre-ER+
MEFs were treated with 1 µM tamoxifen for 72 hours. Following this, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared and hsp90 was
immunoprecipitated. Immunoblot analyses were performed for acetyl-lysine (Ac-K) and hsp90. Alternatively, immunoblot analyses were
performed for HDAC3 and hsp90 on the cellular fractions. The expression levels of lamin B and α/β-tubulin served as the fraction and
loading control. D. Hdac3FL/+-Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/--Cre-ER+ MEFs were treated with 1 µM tamoxifen for 72 hours. Then, immunoblot

lysates E. Hdac3FL/+-Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/--Cre-ER+ MEFs were treated with 1 M tamoxifen for 72 hours. Then, cells were analyzed by

shRNA, Hdac3-deficient MEFs also exhibited decreased
expression levels of BRCA1 and ATR but increased levels
of CHK1 and γ-H2AX (Figure 4D). In addition, compared
to control MEFs, Hdac3-/- MEFs exhibited 2-fold greater
tail moments as measured by the comet assay, indicating
that deletion of Hdac3 results in increased levels of DNA
damage in the MEFs (Figure 4E).

enhance the DNA damaging effects of ABT-888. As shown
in Figure 5B, compared to treatment with either agent
alone, co-treatment with VS and ABT-888, significantly
enhanced ABT-888-mediated DNA damage in the TNBC
cells resulting in increased comet tail moments (p<0.05).
Figure 5C demonstrates that BRCA1-mutant HCC1937
cells were the most sensitive to the combined effects of
VS and ABT-888. Consistent with this, co-treatment
with VS and ABT-888 synergistically induced apoptosis
of the TNBC cells as determined by median dose effect
and isobologram analyses (Figure 5D and Supplemental
Figure 2). Combination indices (CI) were calculated for
the combinations in each cell line. All CI values were
less than 1.0 indicating a synergistic interaction between
ABT-888 and VS. In contrast, treatment with ABT-888
and/or VS induced relatively less apoptosis in the normal
CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells, with less than 20%
cell death induced by the combination (Supplemental
Figure 3). While depleting BRCA1, RAD52 and ATR the
synergistic activity of co-treatment with VS and ABT888 was associated with greater induction of γ-H2AX,
p21, cleaved caspase 3 and the isoforms of BIM in the
SUM159PT cells (Figure 5E).

these reports, treatment with the PARP inhibitor ABT-888
induced significantly more apoptosis in BRCA1-mutant
HCC1937 cells, as compared to those TNBC cell types
lacking BRCA1 mutation (Figure 5A). We next asked
whether co-treatment with a pan-HDAC inhibitor, which
causes depletion of DDR and HR proteins, would further

cells were treated with cisplatin and vorinostat (VS) for 48 hours and the % apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry. Median
dose effect and isobologram analyses were performed using Calcusyn. Combination index (CI) values less than 1.0 indicate a synergistic
interaction of the two agents in the combination. E. Pan-HDAC inhibitor, by inhibiting HDAC6 levels and activity, induces acetylation and
inhibits the chaperone activity of hsp90. This disrupts the chaperone association of hsp90 with its client proteins, such as ATR, BRCA1,
RAD52 and CHK1, leading to depletion of their expression levels. Cisplatin treatment leads to decreases in DNA repair and abrogation of
cell cycle checkpoints. Treatment with PARP inhibitor inhibits DNA repair leading to accumulation of DNA damage. Combined treatment
with HDAC inhibitor and PARP inhibitor leads to greater DNA damage and increased cell death through increased ROS and inhibition of
homologous recombination due to depletion of BRCA1 and RAD52. Combined treatment with pan HDAC inhibitor and cisplatin causes
greater abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints through HDAC inhibitor-mediated depletion of ATR and CHK1. In addition, accumulation of
DNA damage from the combined action of HDAC inhibitor and cisplatin leads to increased cell death of breast cancer cells.

also significantly improved the survival of mice, as
demonstrated in the Kaplan-Meier plot (p=0.02) (Figure
6B). The dose and schedule of ABT-888 and PARP, as used
here for 3 weeks, did not induce any discernible toxicity
in the mice. In separate cohorts of mice, we also excised
the tumors following treatment for 1 week with ABT-888
and/or VS, and performed immunoblot analyses on the
cell lysates. Figure 6C demonstrates that tumors from the
mice treated with the combination exhibited depletion of
BRCA1, RAD52, CHK1 and ATR, while simultaneously
showing induction of γ-H2AX, cleaved caspase 3, and
BIM (Figure 6C). Increased levels of hyperacetylated
histone H3 were also noted, indicating that biologically
effective levels of VS were achieved (Figure 6C).

first time that HDI-mediated depletion of HR (BRCA1 and
RAD52) and DDR proteins (ATR and CHK1) sensitizes
TNBC cells, whether they have, or lack, BRCA1 mutation,
to the PARP inhibitor veliparib and the DNA damaging
agent cisplain. However, the combination of an HDI and
veliparib or cisplatin was more effective against TNBC
cells expressing BRCA1 mutation. These findings are
also consistent with the previous reports, and highlight
the underlying mechanism that down regulation of
BRCA1 and RAD52 levels would confer BRCAness and
undermine HR in TNBC cells lacking BRCA1 mutation
[1,2,19]. As compared to treatment with the vehicle control
or each agent alone, co-treatment with VS and ABT-888
also exerted significantly superior anti-tumor effects and
improved the survival of the mice engrafted with TNBC
cells. The improvement in survival was associated with a
marked in vivo depletion in ATR, CHK1 and RAD52, but
induction of γ-H2AX, cleaved Caspase 3 and BIM in the
engrafted tumor cells following 1 week of treatment with
the combination. These findings suggest that the superior
anti-tumor activity of the combination is potentially due to
the perturbations in the expression of these proteins.
Our findings here also illuminate the mechanism
by which HDI treatment depletes the nuclear DDR
and HR proteins. Treatment with the HDIs PS and VS
induces hyperacetylation and inhibition of the chaperone
association of nuclear HSP90 with the DDR and HR
proteins. The class I HDAC3 was specifically involved in
deacetylating HSP90, since its inhibition with PS or VS
[32], or the genetic knockdown of HDAC3, was associated
with the induction of nuclear HSP90 acetylation and
depletion of the DDR and HR proteins. HDIs are also
known to induce ROS and inflict DNA damage, which
increases the dependency on DDR and DNA repair
mechanisms for cell survival following exposure to the
HDI [27,33,34]. Several class I and II HDACs have
also been shown to promote DNA DSB repair both by
HR and NHEJ [8,35,36]. Therefore, HDI-induced DNA
damage coupled with the attenuation of the DDR and
HR proteins that leads to inhibition of DNA DSB repair,
in essence creates ‘double jeopardy’ for the TNBC cell
survival. HDAC3 in a complex with NCOR1 and NCOR2
(SMRT) has also been shown to directly promote DNA
repair and genomic stability [29,30,36]. In Hdac3-/cells, increased DNA damage and defective DNA DSB
repair was reported [29,30]. Consistent with this, in the
present studies, inhibition of HDAC3 by treatment with
HDI could also directly undermine DNA DSB repair, in
addition to inducing ‘BRCAness’ through depletion of
the HR proteins. This is supported by our observation
that HDI treatment or genetic knockdown of HDAC3
was associated with in vitro and in vivo induction of the
phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139 and apoptosis
of TNBC cells (Figure 5E and Figure 6C). Furthermore,
the synergistic lethality of the co-treatment with HDI and
veliparib was coupled with greater induction of γ-H2AX,

Co-treatment with VS synergistically enhances
the activity of cisplatin in TNBC cells
Previous studies have documented the activity
of cisplatin against TNBC cells, especially those
expressing mutant BRCA1, which is associated with the
formation of DNA adducts/crosslinks and DNA strand
breaks [18,31]. Consistent with this, we determined that
treatment with cisplatin dose-dependently induced more
apoptosis of HCC1937, as compared to MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplemental Figure 4A). Cisplatin also dosedependently induced apoptosis of SUM159PT cells (data
not shown). We next determined whether co-treatment
with pan-HDAC inhibitor would further sensitize TNBC
cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Figure 6D and
Supplemental Figure 4B-C demonstrate that co-treatment
with VS and cisplatin synergistically induced apoptosis
of HCC1937, MB-231 and SUM159PT cells, with CI
values less than 1.0 in all combinations tested. Figure 6E
graphically depicts the potential basis for the synergistic
anti-TNBC activity of the combination of pan-HDAC
inhibitor and PARP inhibitor or cisplatin. As shown,
treatment with pan-HDAC inhibitor not only induces ROS
and DNA damage but, by also depleting DDR (ATR and
CHK1) and HR proteins (BRCA1 and RAD52), it creates
‘BRCAness’, which sensitizes TNBC cells to PARP
inhibitor or DNA damage induced by cisplatin.

DISCUSSION
Pre-clinical reports and clinical trials have recently
documented the increased sensitivity of cancers expressing
BRCA1 mutation to PARP inhibitor, such as veliparib,
and to DNA damaging agents [2,17,18]. In TNBC cells
expressing BRCA1 mutation and exhibiting impaired
HR, the superior activity of PARP inhibitor is attributed
not only to the concomitant inhibition of BER, but also
to the entrapment of PARP1 and 2 and to the increased
dependency on NHEJ [2,12-14]. Consistent with this,
findings presented here go further in demonstrating for the

all three isoforms of BIM and cleaved Caspase 3 in TNBC
cells.
Recent studies have shown that in cells lacking
BRCA1 mutation, sensitization to treatment with PARP
inhibitor can also be achieved in sporadic breast cancers
through depletion of BRCA1 due to promoter methylation
[21]. ‘BRCAness’ and PARP inhibitor sensitivity has also
been observed in cells exhibiting promoter methylation
of the of the Fanconi Anemia FANCF gene [37].
Depletion and inhibition of the activity of CDK1, which
phosphorylates BRCA1 and is necessary for the formation
of BRCA1 foci and DNA damage repair by HR, was also
reported to sensitize cancer but not the untransformed
cells to PARP inhibition [38]. PTEN mutations and
loss of function was also shown to be associated with
defective HR and sensitization to treatment with PARP
inhibitor [2,39]. Collectively, these reports highlight that
depletion and inhibition of DDR and HR proteins, as was
also observed here due to treatment with HDI, lead to
enhanced sensitivity to PARP inhibitor in sporadic cancers.
Recently, co-treatment with PI3K inhibitor was shown to
significantly enhance the activity of PARP inhibitor against
BRCA-related breast cancer [40]. This would also explain
why treatment with HDI, which is well documented to
deplete p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 [25,26,41], synergistically
enhanced here the activity of the PARP inhibitor veliparib
against TNBC cells. Recently, mechanisms that confer
resistance to PARP inhibition have also been identified
in tumors with defective HR due to BRCA1 mutation.
Loss of 53BP1 was demonstrated to rescue HR and confer
resistance to a PARP inhibitor in cells expressing mutant
BRCA1 [42,43]. Activation of the P-glycoprotein drug
efflux transporter was also shown to confer resistance to
the PARP inhibitor olaparib in a BRCA1-deficient mouse
mammary tumor [43]. Additionally, it is conceivable that
reversion mutations that restore the open reading frame
of BRCA1, as has been documented for BRCA2, may
also confer resistance to PARP inhibitor in breast and
ovarian cancers expressing BRCA1 mutation [2,8,44].
It is tempting to speculate that co-treatment with HDI,
which inhibits DDR, and by attenuating the protein levels
of BRCA1 and RAD52 inhibits HR, may be effective
in preventing resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy. This
may occur through abrogation of the secondary BRCA1
mutations that partially restore BRCA1 function, or by
inhibiting HR that would blunt any restorative effects of
53BP1 loss on HR [2,42-44]. Recently, loss of BRCA1
function was shown to be associated with the expansion
of breast cancer stem and progenitor cells, conferring a
dependency on the expression of the polycomb repressor
2 complex protein EZH2 [45,46]. Additionally, HDAC3
was reported to be essential for stem/progenitor cell
function and DNA replication [47]. This would suggest
that co-treatment with an HDI, which has been previously
demonstrated to attenuate EZH2 levels and inhibit
HDAC3 [37,48], could potentiate PARP inhibitor activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

against TNBC stem/progenitor cells. Collectively, for
all of the supportive rationale cited above, the findings
presented here make a strong case for further testing of
the combination of treatment with an HDI with PARP
inhibitor and/or cisplatin against in vivo models of TNBC
cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDAMB-231 and HCC1937 and HeLa cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
SUM 159PT cells were obtained from Asterand (Detroit,
MI). Cells were thawed and cultured for 3-5 passages,
then frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. All experiments
with cell lines were performed within 6 months after
thawing or obtaining from ATCC or Asterand. Cell line
characterization was performed by ATCC or Asterand
utilizing short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. HeLa
cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids
(NEAA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin as previously
described [6, 41]. MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells
were cultured in RPMI160 media containing 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SUM-159PT cells were
cultured in Ham’s F-12 with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum,
insulin and hydrocortisone. All cell lines were passaged
2-3 times per week. Hdac3FL/+/Cre-ER+ and Hdac3FL/-/CreER+ mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) (kindly provided
and characterized by Dr. Scott Hiebert) were cultured
in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA and 0.5%
penicillin/streptomycin solution. For conditional HDAC3
knockout, MEFs were treated with 1 µM tamoxifen
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 72 hours and fresh
tamoxifen-containing media was added to the cells as
previously described [29,30]. Logarithmically growing
cells were used for all experiments detailed below. Cells
were washed free of the drugs prior to harvesting for
experimentation.

Reagents and antibodies
Carfilzomib was obtained from Selleck Chemicals.
Pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors panobinostat
(PS) and vorinostat (VS) were obtained from Novartis
Pharmaceuticals (East Hanover, NJ) and Selleck
Chemicals, respectively. All drugs were prepared as 10
mM stocks in 100% DMSO and stored in small aliquots
at -80°C to prevent multiple free thaw cycles. Antiphosphorylated (p)-ATR (S428), anti-p-CHK1(S345),

Measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS)

anti-acetyl lysine antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Berverly, MA). Anti-hsp90α and
anti-hsp70 antibody was purchased from Enzo Biosciences
(Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-BRCA1 and anti-γ-H2AX
antibodies were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA).
Anti-CHK1, anti-ATR, anti-HDAC1, anti-HDAC2, and
anti-HDAC3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin, antiFLAG, anti-acetylated α-tubulin and anti-GFP antibodies
and short hairpin RNAs against HDAC1, HDAC2 and
HDAC3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Acetylated-K69 hsp90 (Ac-K69 hsp90) antibody
was previously described [24]. Anti-c-RAF antibody was
purchased from BD Transduction Labs (San Jose, CA).

Intracellular ROS levels were measured by a
microplate reader using the fluorescent dye 5-(and6)-carboxy-2’,7’-difluorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(carboxy-H2DFFDA, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly,
cells were plated on a 96-well plate and incubated
overnight at 37°C. Then, cells were treated with PS (20
to 50 nM) for 8 to 24 hours. As a positive control, cells
were treated with 500 µM H2O2 for 4 hours. At the end of
treatment, cells were washed with 1X PBS and incubated
in phenol red-free medium containing 5 µM carboxyH2DFFDA for 20 min at 37°C. Following this, cells were
washed in 1X PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 10
mM HEPES. The fluorescence was measured at 528 nm
using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) [27].

RNA interference and transfection of cDNAs
For short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated downregulation of HDAC1, 2 and 3, cells were transiently
transfected with shRNAs utilizing Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described [49].
After 24 hours, the cells were washed with media and
incubated an additional 24 to 72 hours. Then, cells were
harvested for Western blot or mRNA analyses. For the
ectopic over-expression of FLAG-tagged hsp90 (F-hsp90),
or green fluorescent protein-tagged CHK1 (GFP-CHK1),
cells were transiently transfected with plasmid vectors
expressing F-hsp90, or GFP-CHK1 cDNA utilizing
Lipofectamine 2000 for 48 hours. Following this, the cells
were treated with panobinostat for 24 hours, and harvested
for Western blot or immunoprecipitation analyses.

Nuclear and cyto solic fraction preparation
Following drug treatments or shRNA transfection,
cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA
buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing Complete EDTAfree protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). Alternatively, cells were harvested and nuclear/
cytoplasmic fractions were prepared using a NE-PER
extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol [49]. Total protein in the lysates
was determined utilizing a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Assessment of apoptosis by annexin-V staining

Immunoblot analyses

Untreated or drug-treated cells were stained with
Annexin-V (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and TOPRO-3 iodide and the percentages of apoptotic cells were
determined by flow cytometry as previously described
[50]. To analyze synergism between ABT-888 (ABT888) or cisplatin and vorinostat, cells were treated
with ABT-888 (10-20 µM) or cisplatin (2-10 µM) and
vorinostat (0.1-2.0 µM) for 48 hours and the percentages
of annexin V-positive, apoptotic cells were determined
by flow cytometry. The combination index (CI) for
each drug combination was calculated by median dose
effect analyses (assuming mutual exclusivity) utilizing
the commercially available software Calcusyn (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO). CI values of less than 1.0 represent a
synergistic interaction of the two drugs in the combination.

Total cell lysates or nuclear and cytosolic fractions
were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to
PVDF-FL membranes. Blots were incubated with primary
antibody overnight at 4°C, washed 3 times with 1X PBST
then incubated in IRDye 680 goat anti-mouse or IRDye
800 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LI-COR,
Lincoln, NE) for 1 hour, washed 3 times in 1X PBST
and scanned with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) [51]. The expression levels of
β-actin were used as the loading control for the Western
blots. Immunoblot analyses were performed at least
twice. Representative immunoblots were subjected to
densitometry analysis. Densitometry was performed using
ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).

Immunoprecipitation

In vivo model of breast cancer

Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged hsp90 was
performed as previously described [24]. Briefly, cell
lysates were mixed with anti-FLAG (M2), anti-hsp90,
anti-ATR or anti-GFP antibody, and incubated overnight
at 4 °C with rotation. Protein G-agarose beads were
added to the antibody/lysate mix and incubated for 3
hours. The beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100) and
sample buffer was added prior to boiling. SDS-PAGE and
immunoblot analyses were performed as described above.

All in vivo studies were approved by, and conducted
in accordance with the guidelines of the IACUC at
Houston Methodist Research Institute. MDA-MB-231
cells (5 million cells per mouse) were injected into the
mammary fat pad of female nude mice (The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Tumor growth was
monitored by external caliper measurement. General
condition of the mice was monitored daily. Treatment was
initiated when mean tumor volume was approximately 200
mm3 for all groups. Mice (n=10 per cohort) were treated
with ABT-888 (25 mg/kg, diluted in sterile, acidified
normal saline (pH 4.0) P.O. daily, 5 days per week),
vorinostat (30 mg/kg diluted in DMSO, i.p. daily, 5 days
per week) or ABT-888 and vorinostat for 3 weeks. Mice
were humanely euthanized when tumor volumes exceeded
1500 mm3. Survival of the mice is reported by a Kaplan
Meier plot [27,33]. For biomarker analysis, a cohort of
mice was treated with ABT-888 and/or VS for 1 week and
then humanely euthanized. Tumors were excised and cell
lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis.

RNA isolation and quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted using an RNAqueous4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and converted into cDNA using
the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) [49]. Primers for
quantitation of ATR, CHK1, HDAC1, 2 and 3 mRNA
expression were purchased from Origene (Rockville,
MD). Relative mRNA expressions were normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as mean plus or minus standard
error of the mean (SEM). Significant differences between
a population of breast cancer cells treated with PS and/or
NAC or VS and ABT-888 were determined using a twotailed, paired t-test within an analysis package add-on in
Microsoft Excel. P values less than 0.05 were assigned
significance. A two-way ANOVA analysis was used to
determine significant differences in mean tumor volumes
in the xenograft model. P values less than 0.05 were
assigned significance. Significant differences in survival
of animals were calculated using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
test. P values less than 0.05 were assigned significance.

Immunofluorescent microscropy
MEF cells were grown on chamber slides overnight
at 37°C. Following this, cells were treated with 50 nM PS
for 24 hours. At the end of treatment, cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. The slides were
blocked with 3% BSA for 30 minutes and incubated with
anti-hsp90α, anti-Ac-K69 hsp90α, anti-acetyl α-tubulin,
anti-ATR or anti-HDAC3 antibody for 2 hours at 37°C
[24,41,49]. The slides were washed three times in 1X
PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies for
1 hour. After three washes with 1X PBS, the cells were
counterstained using SlowFade Gold anti-fade reagent
with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and imaged using a
AxioCam MRm microscope with a 40x (0.6 Na) objective
(Carl Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany).
