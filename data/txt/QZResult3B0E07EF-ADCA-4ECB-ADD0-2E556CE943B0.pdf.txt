Chloroquine in Glioblastoma—New
Horizons for an Old Drug
Anusheel Munshi, MD, DNB

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is 1 of the most aggressive neoplasms of the central nervous system. GBMs usually follow an aggressive course, and patients have a median survival of 8 months to 10
months.1 These tumors have a diffusely infiltrating nature. Therefore, all local therapies, such as surgery
and radiation, are inherently palliative. Recently, there has been some improvement in the survival of
patients with GBM with the use temozolamide along with postoperative radiotherapy.2 One of the important mechanisms of benefit from using radiotherapy and temozolamide is the radiopotentiation produced
by temozolamide.3 When temozolamide was administered concurrently with radiotherapy and was continued after radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy, a large randomized trial demonstrated a small but significant
survival benefit of 2.5 months compared with radiotherapy alone (median survival, 14.6 months vs 12.1
months). The benefit of temozolomide was maintained for 2 years after diagnosis, although only 27% of
patients remained alive at that time.2
Some other agents also have been investigated in GBM with limited success. Recent studies have
assessed the role of irinotecan (CPT-11) and bevacizumab (Avastin) as a novel combination for recurrent
GBM.4 Fifty-one patients with recurrent, high-grade glioma were treated with this combination and were
assessed in a very recent study. In that trial, the median progression-free survival was 13.4 months for
patients with anaplastic gliomas and 7.6 months for patients with GBM.5
Loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, which is common in GBM, results in
activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thereby increasing messenger RNA translation
of several key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mTOR. In a phase 2
study, 43 patients with recurrent GBM received CCI-779 up to a weekly dose of 250 mg until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal. In that study, there were no episodes of grade 4 hematologic toxicities, and no toxic deaths were reported. One patient was progression
free at 6 months. Of the patients in that study who were assessable for response, there were 2 partial
responses, and 20 patients had stabilization of disease. The median time to disease progression was 9
weeks, and CCI-779 was tolerated well at that dose schedule.6
The other agent that has been assessed for its role in GBM is imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor, the proto-oncogene product c-kit, and the

fusion protein Bcr-Abl. In a phase 1/2 study, the maximum tolerated dose and the dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate when administered for 8 days in
combination with temozolomide to patients with malignant glioma (MG) were assessed. Patients with MG who
had not failed on prior temozolamide were eligible to
receive temozolamide at a dose from 150 mg/m2 daily to
200 mg/m2 daily on Days 4 through 8 plus imatinib
mesylate administered orally on Days 1 through 8 of each
4-week cycle. Among patients with GBM who had stable
disease at enrollment (n ¼ 28), the median progressionfree survival was 41.7 weeks, and the overall survival was
56.1 weeks. Imatinib doses up to 1000 mg daily for 8 consecutive days were tolerated well when combined with
standard temozolamide dosing for patients with MG.7 It
is readily apparent that, despite the promise demonstrated
by several available agents, long-term disease control
remains elusive.
Chloroquine is used commonly used in the treatment of malaria, a disease caused by infection with the
parasite Plasmodium.8 Although chloroquine appears to
possess diverse pharmacologic activity, its plasmodicidal
activity results from augmentation of parasite oxidative
stress. There are several decades of clinical experience with
the use of chloroquine for the treatment of various parasitic and immune-mediated disorders, although its mechanism of action still is being revealed.8,9
Chloroquine appears to augment oxidative stress in
metabolically active mammalian cells, including human
astroglial cells. It has been suggested that chloroquine may
augment oxidative stress induced by radiotherapy in the
treatment of GBM.6 The other main actions of chloroquine responsible for most intracellular actions are 1)
molecular intercalation of chloroquine into DNA and 2)
inhibition of lysosomic enzymes, particularly phospholipase A2. Configurational changes in nucleic acids render
neoplastic cells more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of
radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy.10–12 The lysosomotropic properties of chloroquine are the most important for many of the biologic effects of this drug,
including radiosensitisation. Because of its weak base
properties, chloroquine accumulates in several intracellular organelles and raises intravesicular pH.13 Chloroquine
could damage cells in which lysosomal permeability has
been increased by radiation and, thus, could cause the
release of proteolytic enzymes, which damage cellular proCancer

teins, including plasma membrane-associated proteins
(Figs. 1, 2). Furthermore, chloroquine could sequester
important cell membrane constituents, such as ceramides,
in lysosomes, thus limiting plasma membrane repair.14
Interesting clinical data about clinical experience
with chloroquine as adjuvant in the treatment of GBM
are emerging. Sotelo and colleagues conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among
patients with pathologically confirmed GBM. Of 18
patients with GBM who underwent standard treatment
with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, 9 patients
received an additional 150-mg dose of chloroquine daily
starting 1 day after surgery and continued through the observation period. Follow-up in that study ranged from 24
months to 50 months, and survival was the main outcome
measure. Survival was significantly longer in chloroquinetreated patients than in the control group (33 months vs
11 months, respectively; P ¼ .0002). At the end of the observation period, 4 patients (46%) who received chloroquine were alive: Two patients had evidence of tumor

longed periods as well in chronic diseases. Daily doses of
chloroquine up to 500 mg daily for prolonged periods are
tolerated well in patients with human immunodeficiency
virus-1/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis.17 Although this prolonged administration of chloroquine does result in certain side effects, it
would be of limited importance in a disease like GBM, in
which the median survival is approximately 1 year to 1.5
years.
The use of chloroquine as adjuvant therapy for
patients with GBM needs to be tested in large prospective
trials. This would be a highly cost effective strategy for
patients who cannot afford temozolamide. In addition, it
may benefit patients on chemoradiation who are receiving
temozolamide in view of the consequent chemosensitization. Therefore, chloroquine has the potential to open
new frontiers in the treatment of glial neoplasms, because
it has the unique features of a well studied side-effects profile, it is inexpensive, and it is easily available. Harnessing
its potential for achieving therapeutic gain would be the
real challenge.

remission after 2 years; and, in the other 2 patients, tumor
recurrence developed after 2 years and 4 years in remission, respectively. No control patients survived for >22
months after surgery.15
In another relevant study, 41 patients with GBM
received chloroquine as an optional adjuvant administered concurrently with conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Eighty-two contemporary patients
with GBM who did not receive chloroquine were
included in that analysis as a control group. Radiotherapy
was divided into 30 doses of 60 grays. Chemotherapy
with 6 courses of carmustine was given starting 3 months
after surgery. Patients who were treated with chloroquine
took the drug for 12 months to 18 months at a daily dose
of 150 mg starting on Day 15 after their surgery. Survival
in the patients who received chloroquine was 25  3.4
months compared with 11.4  1.3 months in the control
group (P ¼ .000; odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.6); the difference remained significant after
regression analysis for possible clinical confounders.16
A critical feature is the need for protracted use of
chloroquine in GBM therapy. Fortunately, there has been
relatively good experience of use of chloroquine for pro2382
