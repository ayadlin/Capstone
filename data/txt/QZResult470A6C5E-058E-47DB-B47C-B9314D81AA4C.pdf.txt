Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aggressive cancers often express E-cadherin in cytoplasmic vesicles rather than on the plasma
membrane and this may contribute to the invasive phenotype of these tumors. Therapeutic
strategies are not currently available that restore the anti-invasive function of E-cadherin in
cancers. MDA-MB-231 cells are a frequently used model of invasive triple-negative breast cancer,
and these cells express low levels of E-cadherin that is mislocalized to cytoplasmic vesicles.
MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing wild-type E-cadherin or E-cadherin fused to
glutathione S-transferase or green fluorescent protein were used as experimental systems to probe
the mechanisms responsible for cytoplasmic E-cadherin localization in invasive cancers. Although
E-cadherin expression partly reduced cell invasion in vitro, E-cadherin was largely localized to the
cytoplasm and did not block the invasiveness of the corresponding orthotopic xenograft tumors.
Further studies indicated that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the highly potent class I
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor largazole cooperated to induce E-cadherin localization to
the plasma membrane in triple-negative breast cancers, and to suppress cellular invasion in vitro.
Dexamethasone blocked the production of the cleaved form of the CDCP1 (that is, CUB domaincontaining protein 1) protein (cCDCP1) previously implicated in the pro-invasive activities of
CDCP1 by upregulating the serine protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. E-cadherin

did not influence CDCP1 cleavage, but increased the association of E-cadherin with -catenin.
This effect on E-cadherin/ -catenin complexes was shared with the nonisoform selective HDAC
inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), although
largazole upregulated endogenous E-cadherin levels more strongly than TSA. These results
demonstrate that glucocorticoids and HDAC inhibitors, both of which are currently in clinical use,
cooperate to suppress the invasiveness of breast cancer cells through novel, complementary
mechanisms that converge on E-cadherin.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Basal-like breast tumors are largely overlapping with the triple-negative subtype defined by
low estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 expression, and tend to be locally
invasive and recur at high frequency.1,2 Animal modeling and human studies suggest that Ecadherin functions as a tumor suppressor and an invasion suppressor.3 E-cadherin is often
absent or nonfunctional in invasive breast cancers and this is commonly attributed to
epigenetic silencing of the E-cadherin gene, Cdh1.4 Efforts toward reactivating E-cadherin
expression therefore, may have therapeutic implications.5,6 However, E-cadherin levels are
maintained in some invasive breast cancers although it is mislocalized to cytoplasmic
vesicles.7,8 These data suggest that reinstating E-cadherin expression may not restore its
tumor and invasion suppressive actions unless the posttranslational mechanisms that nullify
E-cadherin function in cancers are also blocked.
E-cadherin is a homophilic cell–cell adhesion molecule whose extracellular domain binds to
surface E-cadherin on adjacent cells while its cytoplasmic tail is a platform for recruitment
of p120ctn, -catenin and -catenin. The latter two proteins interact with -catenin that in
turn directly or indirectly couples the E-cadherin complex with the actin cytoskeleton. These
multiprotein E-cadherin-containing complexes have a critical physical role in mediating the
formation of adherens junctions in epithelial tissues,9 and control the subcellular trafficking
and activity of several transcriptional regulators.10,11 It is important therefore, to define the
mechanisms responsible for E-cadherin mislocalization in invasive cancers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

E-cadherin was found to complex with the same proteins in both luminal and basal-like
breast cancer cells, but the binding stoichiometry to -catenin versus -catenin differed.
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing E-cadherin-green fluorescent protein (E-Cad-GFP) or
E-cadherin-glutathione S-transferase (E-Cad-GST) fusion proteins were used as model
systems to identify agents that relocalize E-cadherin from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma
membrane, facilitate cell–cell adhesion and attenuate invasion. The glucocorticoid
dexamethasone and the novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor largazole12,13 each
partially restored E-cadherin membrane localization and suppressed invasion, and the
combination of these agents was more effective than either compound alone.
Dexamethasone blocked the cleavage of the pro-invasive protein CUB domain-containing
protein 1 (CDCP1) by upregulating the serine protease inhibitor plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), preventing the preferential interaction of the cleaved form of CDCP1
with E-cadherin. HDAC inhibitors, in contrast, selectively increased E-cadherin interaction
with -catenin. Collectively, these results demonstrate that dexa-methasone and largazole
cooperatively suppress the invasiveness of triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro, and
restore E-cadherin membrane localization and cell–cell junctions in cell culture as well as in
ex vivo tumors and intact tumors in vivo.

E-cadherin is nonfunctional in invasive breast cancer cells even when it is expressed at
high levels

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines were engineered to stably express E-cadherin fused with
either GFP or GST, and the resulting cell lines were analyzed by immunoblot in comparison
with the corresponding vector control cell lines transduced with the empty retroviral vector
encoding the Neomycin resistance gene (Figure 1a). Cadherin 11 has been implicated in
increased breast cancer invasiveness and is expressed in the MDA-MB-231 cells,14,15
therefore we examined whether forced E-cadherin expression alters Cadherin 11 levels. ECad-GST, but not wild-type E-cadherin or E-Cad-GFP, was consistently observed to
significantly decrease Cadherin 11 levels suggesting that increased GST rather than Ecadherin expression suppresses steady-state Cadherin 11 levels. Fluorescence microscopy
indicated that E-Cad-GFP localizes to cell–cell junctions in the T47D cells, but is
cytoplasmic in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1b, top panel) and it has a similar subcellular
distribution to endogenously expressed E-cadherin (Figure 1b, bottom panel). MDAMB-231 cells stably expressing E-Cad-GFP exhibited the same properties as the parental
MDA-MB-231 cells when injected into the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice,
including the formation of tumors that lack a defined tumor-stroma boundary and invasion
into the adjacent mammary gland (Figure 1c). Clearly, E-Cad-GFP expression was retained
during tumor formation and growth (Figure 1d), and did not block tumor invasion in vivo.
These data suggest that in addition to low E-cadherin expression levels, E-cadherin function
is suppressed in MDA-MB-231 cells.
E-cadherin forms complexes with adherens junction components in invasive breast
cancer cells, but with an altered ratio of β-catenin versus γ-catenin binding

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

E-cadherin-GST complexes were isolated from the membrane fractions of the T47D/E-GST
and 231/E-GST cell lines by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose and
analyzed by SDS–PAGE/silver stain (Figure 2a, left panel) and proteomics using iTRAQ
labeling. The proteomics results were verified by immuno-blot (Figure 2a, right panel). Ecadherin-containing complexes were similar between the two cell lines with the exception
that the ratio of -catenin to -catenin bound with E-cadherin was significantly higher in the
T47D cells as compared with the MDA-MB-231 cells. This difference may be partly
explained by the relatively high levels of -catenin expression in the T47D cells as
compared with the MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar results were obtained if E-cadherin
complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation using antibodies to E-cadherin or GST
(Figure 2b). These findings suggested that the relatively low level of -catenin expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells might be responsible for the localization of E-cadherin to the
cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we generated MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing
hexahistidine tagged -catenin ( -catenin-His6), or expressing -catenin-His6 in combination
with E-cadherin, E-Cad-GFP or E-Cad-GST. Immunoblot analysis indicated that each of the
proteins was expressed as expected (Figure 2c). Interestingly, -catenin was expressed at
very low levels in the control 231/neo cells transduced with the empty retroviral vector as
compared with the cell lines overexpressing E-Cadherin or -catenin either separately or
together. However, despite the increased expression of -catenin and -catenin in the doubly
transduced stable cell lines, the resulting cell lines exhibited a mesenchymal morphology
similar to that of the parental MDA-MB-231 cells and did not form colonies when grown in
culture, indicating a lack of cell–cell adhesion (not shown). These results (Figures 1 and 2)
suggest that the diminished E-cadherin function in MDA-MB-231 cells is not simply
because of decreased E-cadherin, -catenin, or -catenin expression. One hypothesis is that
additional post-translational mechanisms are operative that prevent proper E-cadherin

membrane localization and function in MDA-MB-231 cells, and that it may be possible to
antagonize these mechanisms pharmacologically.

Dexamethasone and largazole cooperate to restore the formation of adherens junctions in
invasive breast cancer cells and to block their invasion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The 231/E-GFP cell line was treated with a series of small molecule signaling agonists and
antagonists to identify compounds that modulate E-cadherin subcellular localization,
including Gö6983, Gö6976, TGF , TGF RI receptor kinase inhibitor, U0126, nocodazole,
paclitaxel, PD0332991, CVT313, IC261, SU11274, MG132, apratoxin A, tunicamycin,
rapamycin, LiCl, PMA, FK506, cyclosporine A, calyculin A, Y27632, PP1, dasatinib,
lapatinib, JAK inhibitor I (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), tubacin, chloroquine,
GM6001, dexamethasone and largazole. Of these agents, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone
and the highly potent HDAC inhibitor largazole12,13 each converted E-cadherin expressing
MDA-MB-231 cells, but not the corresponding vector control cell line, to a more epitheliallike cobblestone morphology. The most striking difference was that dexamethasone and
largazole, in combination with E-cadherin expression, prevented the cells from overlapping
each other (Figure 3a). This effect was reversed by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist
RU486, and was not observed in the absence of exogenous E-cadherin expression.
Dexamethasone and largazole also modestly increased E-cadherin localization to the cell–
cell periphery, and combination of the two drugs caused a more complete E-cadherin
junctional localization than either agent alone (Figure 3b). Changes in E-cadherin
localization partially overlapped with changes in -catenin localization. In vitro invasion
assays were performed to determine the respective effects of E-cadherin expression and
Dex. + Larg. (Dex. + Larg.) treatment on the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Ecadherin expression and dexa-methasone and largazole treatment each decreased
invasiveness, and combined E-cadherin expression and Dex. + Larg. treatment reduced
invasion more than either manipulation alone (Figure 3c).
Similar experiments were carried out in the BT549 invasive basal-like human breast cancer
cell line that expresses a moderate level (see Figure 4d, below) of endogenous wild-type Ecadherin.16 Dex. and Larg. cooperated to increase the junctional localization of endogenous
E-cadherin in BT549 cells (Figure 3d). These effects were reversed by RU486.
Dexamethasone and largazole each suppressed the invasion of BT549 cells in vitro, and
combination of the two agents diminished invasion to a greater extent than either one alone
(Figure 3e). Dex. + Larg. induction of E-cadherin trafficking to the plasma membrane in
both the 231/E-Cad-GFP and BT549 cell lines, as compared with the vehicle control, was
quantitated in Figure 3f. Dex. + Larg. increased junctional E-cadherin 19-fold in the 231/ECad-GFP cells and nearly four-fold in the BT549 cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Dex. + Larg. prevents the cleavage of CDCP1, and cleaved CDCP1 associates with Ecadherin
Dissolution of adherens junctions can be caused by the activation of tyrosine kinases such as
c-Src or c-Met, and this is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction
components such as -catenin and E-cadherin.17–19 It was important to determine, therefore,
whether dexamethasone treatment causes changes in the patterns of cellular protein tyrosine
phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis of MDA-MB-231 cell lysates with two different antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a band of ~80 kDa that vanished upon treatment of the
cells with Dex. + Larg. (Figure 4a). Proteins from the same extracts were
immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and the immunoprecipitates
were resolved by SDS–PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining. A doublet in
the vicinity of the 80 kDa molecular weight marker was digested with trypsin and subjected
to mass spectrometry. Ten of the peptides identified corresponded to the 130 kDa protein

isoform 1 of CDCP1 (Figure 4b). CDCP1, also independently discovered as trask,20 is a
heavily tyrosine phosphorylated protein that has been implicated in cancer
invasiveness,21–23 suggesting that the effects of Dex. + Larg. treatment on CDCP1 might be
relevant to the anti-invasive properties of these drugs. Interestingly, all of the peptides
identified were C-terminal to the known Matriptase cleavage site of CDCP1.24 CDCP1
cleavage is associated with its increased tyrosine phosphorylation, and the C-terminal,
integral membrane fragment may mediate CDCP1 anti-adhesive activity.24–26 Matriptase
cleavage of CDCP1 produces a C-terminal fragment of ~80 kDa, suggesting that Dex. +
Larg. treatment may prevent CDCP1 proteolytic cleavage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunoblot analysis with a CDCP1 antibody displayed the same pattern of bands observed
with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in which the full-length form is present, but the
cleaved form of CDCP1 (cCDCP1) is absent when the cells were treated with Dex. + Larg.
(Figure 4c). These results further support the notion that Dex. + Larg. treatment prevents
CDCP1 cleavage. Immunoblot analysis of a panel of 14 human breast cancer cell lines
showed that 11 of the lines exhibit a significant level of CDCP1 expression (Figure 4d). The
ratio between the full length and cleaved forms varies among the cell lines that express
CDCP1. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from MDA-MB-231 or BT549 cells treated with
various combinations of dexamethasone, largazole and RU486 demonstrated that
dexamethasone blocks CDCP1 cleavage in the MDA-MB-231 cells and this is partially
reversed by RU486 (Figure 4e). In contrast, in BT549 cells dexamethasone decreased the
total levels of CDCP1, and this effect was reversed by RU486. This suggests that
dexamethasone may have dual regulatory effects on CDCP1; in some cell lines blocking
CDCP1 cleavage and in other lines blocking its expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although CDCP1 interacts with P-cadherin and N-cadherin,20 it is unknown whether
CDCP1 associates with E-cadherin. E-cadherin immunoprecipitation experiments showed
that cCDCP1 binds E-cadherin, and that Dex. + Larg. treatment blocks the formation of this
complex by preventing CDCP1 cleavage in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4f). Recombinant
adenoviruses encoding C-terminally FLAG-tagged full length, wild-type CDCP1 or a
CDCP1 deletion mutant corresponding to cCDCP1 ( CDCP1) were used to examine their
interaction with E-cadherin. An additional CDCP1 mutant (CDCP1-CSM) was constructed
in which the matriptase cleavage site QSR KFV, where ‘ ’ denotes the cleavage site, was
mutated to QSSSFV. FLAG antibody immunoprecipitations indicated that CDCP1
interacted more avidly with E-cadherin than either CDCP1 or CDCP1-CSM (Figure 4g).
The short form of CDCP1 appeared to be more heavily tyrosine phosphorylated than the full
length forms, consistent with previous observations.25,26 cCDCP1 binds to c-Src20,27 and
participates in the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of PKC .28 c-Src and
PKC disrupt adherens junctions and induce cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin.29
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cCDCP1 targets c-Src and PKC to adherens
junctions, resulting in their dissolution, and that dexamethasone prevents loss of cell–cell
adhesion by blocking the proteolytic production of cCDCP1.
Dexamethasone controls CDCP1 cleavage through the upregulation of PAI-1
Dexamethasone might control CDCP1 cleavage either by down-regulating a relevant
protease or by increasing the levels of a protease inhibitor. Dexamethasone upregulated the
serine protease inhibitor PAI-1 in the MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with other findings,30
and this correlated with reduced CDCP1 cleavage (Figure 5a). TGF also upregulated PAI-1
expression and similarly blocked CDCP1 cleavage. MDA-MB-231 cells secrete
plasminogen activators,30 which convert plasminogen to plasmin, a protease that, in turn,
effectively cleaves CDCP1.25,26 Therefore, it is expected that CDCP1 cleavage will
decrease in cells grown in low serum medium, or medium that promotes the upregulation of
PAI-1. Growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in low serum (0.1%) medium supplemented with

insulin, transferrin and selenium inhibited CDCP1 cleavage (Figure 5b), likely because of
the combined effect of decreased (serum-derived) plasminogen and insulin-induced
upregulation of PAI-1 expression.31,32 Previous studies have implicated CDCP1 cleavage in
increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cCDCP1, coincident with increased signaling
functions.25,26 Together the results in Figures 5a and b indicate that the components of cell
culture media including serum levels, supplementation with glucocorticoids such as
dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, supplementation with insulin, as well as factors
produced by the cancer cells themselves, such as TGF , and the plasminogen activators uPA
and tPA have important roles in controlling CDCP1 cleavage, and consequently its tyrosine
phosphorylation and biological activity.
A recombinant adenovirus encoding PAI-1 was constructed to determine whether PAI-1
expression is sufficient to block CDCP1 cleavage. As indicated in Figures 5c and d, PAI-1
expression largely blocked CDCP1 cleavage in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and BT549
cells and completely blocked CDCP1 cleavage in T47D cells.
HDAC inhibitors preferentially increase E-cadherin association with γ-catenin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Numerous reports have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors increase E-cadherin expression
in certain cancer cell lines where it is epigenetically silenced. Therefore, we examined
whether largazole increases E-cadherin expression. Largazole upregulated E-cadherin in a
time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 6a) to a significantly greater extent than did
Trichostatin A (TSA). Three observations suggested that this increased E-cadherin
expression could not completely explain the effects of largazole on cellular behavior: (1)
The most striking effects of largazole were on E-cadherin localization rather than its cellular
levels. (2) The increased levels of E-cadherin in the MDA-MB-231 cells are below the
steady-state endogenous levels of E-cadherin present in more epithelial-like cancer cell lines
such as T47D and (3) maximal Dex. + Larg.-induced changes in cell morphology and cell
adhesion require exogenous E-cadherin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As largazole did not influence CDCP1 cleavage, nor appear to function exclusively through
upregulating endogenous E-cadherin expression, it was important to assess whether
Largazole alters the subunit composition of E-cadherin-containing complexes. These
analyses indicated that largazole preferentially increased -catenin binding to E-cadherin
relative to -catenin binding (Figure 6b) without changing the levels of -catenin. In
contrast, dexamethasone did not increase -catenin binding to E-cadherin, but as expected,
decreased cCDCP1 binding to E-cadherin. Affinity purification of complexes containing Ecadherin (E-Cad-GST) and -catenin ( -Cat-His6) by sequential TALON and
glutathioneagarose chromatography further demonstrated that Dex. + Larg. treatment
dramatically increased the stability of E-cadherin/ -catenin complexes (Figure 6c).
It is possible that largazole alters E-cadherin association with -catenin through mechanisms
that are independent of HDAC inhibition. Largazole requires a sulfhydryl group that inhibits
HDAC activity by binding to its active site zinc ion.33–35 In contrast, the HDAC inhibitors
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and TSA bind the active site zinc ion via their
hydroxamate moieties and are structurally very different from largazole. It was reasoned,
therefore, that if largazole increased E-cadherin association with -catenin by inhibiting
HDAC activity, then TSA and SAHA should have similar effects. Indeed, largazole, SAHA
and TSA each stabilized E-cadherin/ -catenin complexes to similar extents relative to
vehicle treatment (Figure 6d).

Dexamethasone and largazole cooperate to induce junctional E-cadherin localization in
tumor samples ex vivo and in intact tumors in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It was necessary to evaluate whether dexamethasone and largazole would induce E-cadherin
relocalization to sites of cell–cell contact in intact tumor samples ex vivo. For these studies 3
mm cubes of tumor tissue were treated in vitro with DMSO vehicle, dexamethasone,
largazole or Dex. + Larg. and analyzed by multiphoton microscopy for E-cadherin-GFP
fluorescence (Figure 7a), or subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) (Figure 7b).
Dexamethasone and largazole treatment induced E-cadherin localization to cell–cell
contacts, whereas in the control samples E-cadherin was nearly uniformly distributed with
weak junctional E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence signal evident in some areas. H&E staining
demonstrated that vehicle control tumor samples exhibited an irregular periphery with
cancer cells budding off the surface. In contrast, dexamethasone, largazole and Dex. + Larg.
induced a sharper tumor boundary and a striking increase in the organization of cancer cells
at the tumor border. However, in dexamethasone- and largazole-treated samples, surface
cancer cells exhibited an elongated spindle morphology, whereas the surface cancer cells in
the Dex. + Larg. treated samples exhibited an epithelial-like cuboidal morphology. The limit
of this effect to the edge of the tumor samples may reflect the inability of the drugs to
penetrate into the center of the tumor sample by passive diffusion. Thus, the changes in Ecadherin localization apparent in the fluorescence images were accompanied by alterations
in cell–cell adhesion, and the cellular architecture and organization at the surface of the
tumor sample.
These ex vivo studies were followed-up by in vivo studies in which animals bearing
orthotopic tumors derived from 231/ E-Cad-GFP cells were treated with DMSO vehicle,
dexamethasone, largazole or Dex. + Larg. and analyzed by multiphoton microscopy (Figure
7c). Dexamethasone treatment induced E-cadherin localization to cell–cell junctions in some
areas, but not others. Largazole alone did not significantly relocalize E-cadherin, but altered
the morphology of the cancer cells from an elongated spindle-like appearance to a more
cuboidal shape. Dex. + Larg. caused a more uniform localization of E-cadherin to the
plasma membrane, producing a honeycomb-like pattern of E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence.
Staining of the tumor samples with Hoechst to label nuclei demonstrated more clearly the
striking changes in tumor cell morphology induced by Dex. + Larg. treatment (Figure 7d).
We performed coimmunoprecipitation analyses on tumor lysates to examine whether
treatment of the animals with dexamethasone, largazole or Dex. + Larg. altered the
composition of E-cadherin-containing complexes in the tumors in vivo (Figure 7e). Neither
drug altered -catenin or p120ctn binding to E-cadherin, whereas E-cadherin binding to catenin was increased in the context of Dex. + Larg. treatment.

DISCUSSION
E-cadherin as a therapeutic target in invasive cancers
Overexpression of E-cadherin in invasive breast cancer cell lines dramatically reduces their
invasiveness in vitro,36 and this is consistent with our observations (Figure 3c). It is
important to note, however, that these same E-cadherin overexpressing 231/E-Cad-GFP
cells form tumors that invade extensively into the surrounding mammary tissue when grown
as orthotopic xenografts (Figure 1c). Further, E-cadherin is expressed in a subset of invasive
cancers,37,38 and in some cases E-cadherin expression correlates with a worse prognosis
than intermediate levels of expression.39 These observations indicate that the tumor- and
invasion-suppressive functions of E-cadherin are lost in many breast cancers independent of
decreased expression. It may be possible therefore, to identify drug combinations that
restore E-cadherin anticancer actions in this class of tumors.

Decreased E-cadherin expression in human breast cancers is most commonly a result of
epigenetic silencing rather than point mutations or chromosomal deletions. Efforts have
focused on using HDAC inhibitors to restore E-cadherin expression in breast cancers.6
However, in both mouse and human basal-like breast cancer cell lines, E-cadherin is
frequently localized to perinuclear puncta rather than to the plasma membrane, and similar
cytoplasmic localization is observed in clinical triple-negative breast cancer samples
(Corsino et al.7 and Zhang et al.40). This suggests that E-cadherin expressed in basal-like
breast cancer cells might not be functional even if it is expressed at high levels. The results
in Figures 1–7 employing MDA-MB-231 cells expressing exogenous E-cadherin, and
BT549 cells expressing endogenous E-cadherin, support this contention and indicate that a
therapeutic approach for restoring E-cadherin anticancer activity may require components
that reverse epigenetic silencing of the E-cadherin gene, Cdh1, and elements that restore Ecadherin function at the post-translational level.
CDCP1 as a novel target of dexamethasone action

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Dexamethasone suppresses invasion through a number of different mechanisms,41–43
however, the present study is the first to our knowledge that links glucocorticoids to Ecadherin through effects on CDCP1 cleavage. It is possible that blockade of CDCP1
cleavage suppresses invasion in part through means independent of E-cadherin. CDCP1 also
binds to N- and P-cadherin20 and Dex. + Larg. blocks invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells,
which express very low levels of endogenous E-cadherin (compare Figures 1d and 3c).
Further, FAK and CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation were recently shown to be reciprocally
related,27,44 and CDCP1 cleavage-dependent increases in CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation
protect cells from anoikis through mechanisms involving enhanced Src and PKC tyrosine
phosphorylation and activation of the pro-survival kinase Akt.26 This latter study
demonstrated that plasmin is an important regulator of CDCP1 cleavage in vivo. Thus,
CDCP1 cleavage and the resultant increased cCDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation likely
regulate cell–cell and cell–substratum adhesion through multiple parallel mechanisms
involving FAK, Src, PKC and cadherins. Our observations demonstrating the role of PAI-1
in mediating the effects of glucocorticoid and TGF signaling on CDCP1 cleavage provide
new insights into the mechanisms controlling CDCP1 cleavage and biological activity.
Increased E-cadherin/γ-catenin complex formation as a new mechanism of HDAC inhibitor
anticancer activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HDAC inhibitors increase E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells where it has been
epigenetically silenced,6 and the class I selective largazole is more effective in upregulating
E-cadherin expression than the less isoform selective HDAC inhibitor TSA (Figure 6a).
HDAC inhibitors, therefore, may suppress cancer invasion both by increasing E-cadherin
expression, and by reinforcing E-cadherin association with -catenin. To our knowledge,
this is the first report that HDAC inhibitors facilitate the formation of E-cadherin/ -catenin
complexes. An interesting aspect of this observation is that largazole had little effect on Ecadherin association with -catenin even though - and -catenin are 69% identical and may
carry out redundant functions regarding the coupling of E-cadherin to -catenin.
p120 catenin has an important role in localizing E-cadherin to cell–cell contacts.45
Largazole or Dex. + Larg. did not alter E-cadherin binding to p120 catenin or -catenin in
tumor extracts (Figure 7e). -catenin is the only protein known to be present in both
adherens and desmosomal junctions. The formation of adherens junctions precedes the
formation of desmosomal junctions during cell adhesion, and E-cadherin/ -catenin
association may facilitate the formation of desmosomal junctions.46 Therefore, it will be
important to determine what influence, if any, HDAC inhibitors have on desmosomal

Likewise, the ability of cCDCP1 to bind to desmosomal cadherins should be investigated.

The mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors aid the formation of E-cadherin/ -catenin
complexes is unclear and could involve increased acetylation of complex components.
Along these lines, -catenin is regulated by acetylation.47,48 Alternately, an indirect
mechanism involving transcriptional regulation of components of the complex could be
operative.
Potential clinical applications of glucocorticoid and HDAC inhibitor combination therapies
Dexamethasone is currently administered before surgery to palliate the pain and nausea
associated with mastectomies.49 The HDAC inhibitors Romidepsin (FK228) and Vorinostat
(SAHA) are approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These and other
HDAC inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical study for efficacy against multiple types
of human cancer. If glucocorticoids and HDAC inhibitors cooperate to suppress cancer
invasion and tumor recurrence in animal models with acceptable side effects, then future
clinical trials in cancer patients may be warranted. Glucocorticoid signaling in triplenegative breast tumors correlates with a poor prognosis,50 therefore a more suitable
approach might be to mimic the effects of dexamethasone on CDCP1 cleavage through the
use of inhibitors of the plasminogen activators uPA and tPA.

Triple-negative breast cancers as a category are largely overlapping with the basal-like
subtype and are characterized by local invasion and high rates of postsurgical
recurrence.51,52 These cancers frequently do not exhibit defined borders. Therefore,
recurrence is likely a result of incomplete surgical removal. It is possible that a combination
therapy focused on restoring E-cadherin expression and biochemical function could be
administered in the neoadjuvant setting to limit local invasion into the surrounding normal
tissue in order to produce a more defined tumor boundary, resulting in reduced rates of
cancer relapse and improved patient survival rates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of cell extracts and immunoblot analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (SH30003.03; Hyclone
Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% FBSDMEM) in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cell extraction was performed as
described previously53 using buffer containing 1% Triton X100, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% -mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 nM microcystin, 200
M Na3VO4 and 40 mM Na2H2P2O7. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for
Actin (sc-1616R), -catenin (sc-7199), N-cadherin (sc-7939), P-cadherin (sc-7893),
phosphotyrosine (sc-7020 (PY99)) and -catenin (sc-7900) purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; antibodies specific for Smad2 (#3102), phosphoSmad2 (#3101), -catenin (#3236) and CDCP1 (#4115) from Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA; antibodies specific for phosphorylated tyrosine (Cat. 05–321 (4G10))
and Acetyl histone H3 from Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; antibodies specific for Ecadherin (610182), PAI-1 (612024) and p120Ctn (610133) from BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lake, NJ, USA; and antibodies specific for -catenin (138500) and cadherin 11 (321700)
from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA. Cells were treated with dexamethasone (S1322;
Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA), RU486 (10006317; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA), Vorinostat (S1047; Selleck Chemicals), TGF type I receptor kinase inhibitor

Fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy
Fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed essentially as described
previously7 employing antibodies to E-cadherin (610182; BD Bioscience) and -catenin
(138500; Invitrogen).
In vitro invasion assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Invasion assays were performed using BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (Cat.
354481) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells for invasion assays were treated
for 72 h with dexamethasone, largazole or Dex. + Larg. and removed from the flasks with
trypsin/EDTA and washed twice in 10% FBS–DMEM to remove traces of the trypsin used
to detach the cells from the culture flasks. The cells were counted, diluted and added to the
upper chambers of the apparatus in the continued presence of the treatment solutions in
medium containing 0.2% FBS. The lower chambers also contained drug treatments, but
were supplemented with 10% FBS. Invasion was allowed to proceed for 48 h. Non-invaded
cells were removed and cells that had invaded were stained with crystal violet. The assays
were performed in triplicate and for each replicate; cells were counted in five random
microscope fields. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.
Orthotopic tumor studies
Cultured tumor cells were removed from the culture flasks with trypsin/ EDTA, washed
twice with 10% FBS-DMEM, twice with sterile saline and counted. Cells (2 × 106) were
injected into the right inguinal (#4) mammary fat pad of 3–5-week-old female athymic nude
(nu/nu) mice (Charles Rivers International, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) in 100 l of sterile
saline. For analysis of tumor invasion into the mammary fat pad the animals were killed
when the tumors reached 2–3 mm in diameter and the mammary glands were excised, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Tumor
extracts for immunoblot analysis were prepared as described previously.54 All studies
involving animals were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Multiphoton microscopy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For ex vivo tumor studies, 231/E-Cad-GFP tumors were excised from animals and cut into 3
mm cubes. Each cube was transferred to a well of a six-well plate and treated with 0.1%
DMSO vehicle, 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 nM largazole or 100 nM dexamethasone + 10
nM largazole in 10% FBS–DMEM. Treatments were carried out for 6 days with the
treatment solutions being replaced after 4 days. Treated tumor samples were fixed overnight
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The treated, fixed tumor samples were washed in PBS
and cut in half. One half of each tumor sample was stored in PBS at 4 °C for imaging by
multiphoton microscopy, and the other half was subjected to paraffin embedding, followed
by staining with H&E. For in vivo tumor studies, mice bearing 231/E-Cad-GFP tumors were
injected daily with 50 l DMSO vehicle, 10 mg/kg dexamethasone, 10 mg/kg largazole or
10 mg/kg dexamethasone + 10 mg/kg largazole. Animals were treated once daily for a total
of 6 days. Tumors were dissected out 2 h after the final injections and analyzed as described
above for the ex vivo tumor samples.
The E-Cad-GFP-labeled tumor tissues were placed over a glass coverslip on the stage of a
Zeiss LSM510 equipped with a multiphoton microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).
Images were collected with a × 40 water-immersion objective lens. GFP was excited with

780 nm from a Chameleon Ultra Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA,
USA) and images were collected through a 500–550-nm band pass filter. Five images were
randomly collected for each sample through a thickness of 70 m.
Design of viral cDNA expression constructs and adenovirus construction
Construction of γ-catenin constructs—Human -catenin was PCR amplified from the
Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA) plasmid 16827 encoding -catenin in pcDNA3 to add a
5 -BamHI site, a 3 -His6 tag and an EcoRI site 3 to -catenin. The primers used to amplify
-catenin were as follows: 5 -TTTTGGATCCATGGAGGTGATGAACCTGATG-3 and 5 TTTTGAATTCCTAA TGATGATGATGATGATGGGCCAGCATGTGGTCTGC-3 . PCR
amplified -catenin-His6 was subsequently digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into
the corresponding restriction sites of pBabe-Puro (Addgene plasmid 176455). To generate
adenovirus expressing -catenin-His6, -catenin-His6 was excised from the -catenin-His6/
pBabe-Puro vector with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BglII and SalI sites of pShuttleCMV.56 The -catenin-His6/pShuttle-CMV vector was recombined with pAdEasy1 in
BJ5183 cells using an electroporator set at 200 Ohms, 25 mF and 2.5 kV. Recombinant catenin-His6/pAdEasy1 linearized with Pac I was transfected into HEK 293 A cells using
lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Adenovirus expressing
-catenin-His6 was subsequently amplified in HEK 293A cells.

Construction of E-cadherin constructs—QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis
(Agilant, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to add BglII and SpeI sites 5 to the stop codon of
the cDNA encoding human E-cadherin in the E-cadherin/pMS plasmid using the following
primers: 5 -GCTGACATG
TACGGAGGCGGCGAGGACGACAGATCTAAGCTTACTAGTTAGGGGACGCTAG
GTACCGATATCGGCCGGTCCGGCCTAG-3 and 5 -CTAGGCCGGACCGGCCGA
TATCGGTACCTAGCGTCCCCTAACTAGTAAGCTTAGATCTGTCGTCCTCGCCGC
CTCCGTACATGTCAGC-3 . Restriction digests confirmed the presence of the BglII and
SpeI sites. cDNA encoding GFP from Aequorea coerulescens (AcGFP1) was subsequently
PCR amplified to add a 5 -BamHI site and a 3 -SpeI site to GFP. Oligonucleotides used to
amplify GFP are as follows: 5 -TTTTGGATCCGTGAGCAAGGGCGCCCGAG-3 and 5 TTTTACTAGTCTTG TACAGCTCATCCATGCC-3 . cDNA encoding GST from
Schistosoma japonicum was also PCR amplified to add a 5 -BamHI site and a 3 -SpeI site.
Oligonucleotides used to amplify GST were as follows: 5 -TTTTGGATC
CATGGCCCCTATACTAGGTTAT-3 and 5 -TTTTACTAGTACGCGGAACCAGAT
CCGATTTTGG-3 . PCR amplified GFP and GST were digested with BamHI and SpeI and
ligated into the BglII and SpeI sites of E-cadherin/pMS. Thus, GFP and GST were cloned 3
to the coding sequence of E-cadherin in E-cadherin/pMS. E-cadherin-GFP and E-cadherinGST coding regions were subsequently excised from the pMS vector using SfiI and SgfI and
cloned into the corresponding sites in LZRS. The LZRS and E-cadherin/pMS plasmids57,58
were generously provided by Dr Al Reynolds (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA).
Construction of a PAI-1 adenoviral vector
A full length PAI-1 cDNA insert was excised from pcDNA3.1 using 5 -KpnI and 3 -NotI
and cloned into the 5 -KpnI and 3 -NotI sites of pAdTrack-CMV. PAI-1 cloned into the
pAdTrack-CMV vector was used to produce recombinant adenovirus as described above for
-cateninin-His6.
Construction of CDCP1 adenoviral vectors
cDNA encoding human CDCP1 (accession no. NM_002842) cloned into the SgfI and MluI
sites of pCMV6 were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA) (cat. # RC220633).

This plasmid is constructed to encode Myc and DDK tags C-terminal to CDCP1. A SalI
restriction site was introduced 3 to the stop codon encoded in the CDCP1/pCMV6 vector
for the future cloning of CDCP1 into the pAdTrack-CMV vector. QuikChange mutagenesis
was used to introduce the SalI restriction site and simultaneously destroy the PmeI and FseI
sites in the CDCP1/pCMV6 vector. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are as follows:
5 -GACGACGATAAGGTTTAAGTCGACGGCCGC GGTCATAGCTGTTTC-3 and 5 GAAACAGCTATGACCGCGGCCGTCGACTT AAACCTTATCGTCGTC-3 .
QuikChange mutagenesis was subsequently performed using the CDCP1/pCMV6 vector
encoding the 3 SalI site to delete the region encoding the N-terminus of CDCP1 to produce
the short form of CDCP1 (referred to as CDCP1). Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis
are as follows: 5 -CTGCCACGAGAAAGCAACTTTGTCCCT GGCTGTTTCGTG-3 and
5 -CACGAAACAGCCAGGGACAAAGTTGCTTTCTCGTGGCAG-3 . Furthermore, the
cDNA encoding the matriptase cleavage site in CDCP1 was mutated using the following
oligonucleotides: 5 -CGGCCC
GTCAAACAGAGCTCCTCGTTTGTCCCTGGCTGTTTC-3 and 5 -GAAACAGCCA
GGGACAAACGAGGAGCTCTGTTTGACGGGCCG-3 . This mutation changed the Arg
and Lys residues in the Matriptase cleavage site to two Ser residues (referred to as CDCP1CSM).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To generate adenovirus expressing CDCP1, CDCP1 or CDCP1-CSM, cDNA encoding
these constructs was digested from pCMV6 using the 5 -KpnI and 3 -SalI restriction sites.
cDNA encoding CDCP1, CDCP1 and CDCP1-CSM was cloned into the 5 -KpnI and 3 XhoI sites of pAdTrack-CMV. The CDCP1, CDCP1 and CDCP1-CSM constructs in the
pAdTrack-CMV vector were used to produce recombinant adenoviruses as described above.
All of the constructs described above were verified by DNA sequencing.
Construction of stable cell lines
Viruses produced using the vectors encoding E-cadherin and -catenin-His6 described above
were packaged using Phoenix cells59 and the viruses were used to infect the target cell lines
as described previously.53 Cells infected with the E-cadherin vectors were selected with 2
mg/ml G418, and cells infected with the -catenin-His6 retroviral vector were selected with
5 g/ml Puromycin. To produce stable cell lines doubly transduced with E-cadherin and catenin, the lines expressing the E-cadherin constructs were infected with the -catenin-His6
retroviral vector and the resulting cells were selected with 2 mg/ml G418 + 5 g/ml
Puromycin.
Affinity purification of E-cadherin complexes and immunoprecipitation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were subjected to hypotonic lysis and membrane fractions were isolated by
centrifugation for 1 h at 100 000 × g. The pellet was solubilized by sonication in buffer
containing 2% Triton X100, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 nM microcystin, 200 M Na3VO4 and 40 mM
Na2H2P2O7. The membrane extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 100 000 × g, and the
supernatant was used for E-cadherin purifications. Complexes containing E-Cad-GST were
isolated using glutathione-agarose (G4510; Sigma-Aldrich), washed, and either eluted with
5 mM glutathione or eluted by boiling in SDS–PAGE sample buffer. In sequential
purifications involving -catenin-His6 and E-Cad-GST proteins expressed in the same cells,
TALON (635503; Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) resin
purifications were performed as described previously,60 and the 400 mM imidazole eluents
were diluted 10-fold and purified using glutathione-agarose, followed by elution with 5 mM
glutathione. Sequential affinity purification experiments were performed using cells stably
expressing both E-Cad-GST and -catenin-His6, or were carried out in 231/E-Cad-GST cells
that had been infected with an adenovirus encoding -catenin-His6 or an adenovirus

encoding GFP as a control. The affinity purifications performed using either strategy
produced identical results in terms of the observed effects of dexamethasone and largazole
on E-cadherin complexes. Immuno-precipitations were performed as described previously53
using 2 mg of total protein extract per sample and 4 g of antibody per sample.
Immunoprecipitates prepared using antibodies to E-cadherin (610182; BD Biosciences) or
GST (sc-459; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were isolated with 35 l per sample protein
G-sepharose (10-1242; Invitrogen), washed, and eluted by boiling in SDS–PAGE sample
buffer. Extracts from 231/ECad-GFP tumors were precleared with protein G-sepharose
beads before immunoprecipitation analysis of tumor lysates as described previously.54
Identification of CDCP1 by mass spectrometry
Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation as described above
using the 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody (05-321; Millipore) and the proteins were
visualized by staining with colloidal Coomassie (LC6025; Invitrogen). A protein doublet of
~80 kDa that was present in samples derived from vehicle (DMSO) treated cells, but not in
cells treated with 100 nM dexamethasone for 72 h, was excised and digested with trypsin as
previously described.61 The tryptic peptides were separated on an LC Packing (San
Francisco, CA, USA) C18 Pep Map HPLC column and LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out
on a hybrid quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer (QSTAR Elite, AB Sciex Inc., Framingham,
MA, USA).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tandem mass spectra were extracted by ABI Analyst version 1.1. All MS/MS samples were
analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.0.01). Peptide
identifications were accepted if they could be established at >95.0% probability as specified
by the peptide prophet algorithm.62 Protein identifications were accepted if they could be
established at greater than 99.0% probability and contain at least two identified unique
peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the protein prophet algorithm.63
Proteomic comparison of E-cadherin complexes between invasive and noninvasive cancer
cell lines by iTRAQ analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The two samples being compared represented equal amounts of E-cadherin complexes
isolated from either T47D or MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the E-Cad-GST fusion
protein, by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. The samples were reduced,
alkylated, trypsin-digested and labeled using the iTRAQ Reagents Multiplex kit according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The labeled
peptides were separated on a MacroSpin Vydac C18 reverse phase minicolumn (The
Nestgroup Inc., Southborough, MA, USA). The eluates were dried down and dissolved in
strong cation exchange solvent A (25% v/v acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH
2.8). The peptides were fractionated on an Agilent HPLC system 1100 using a
polysulfoethyl A column (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 m, 300 Å, PolyLC, Columbia, MD, USA).
Each strong cation exchange fraction was lyophilized and redissolved in solvent A (3%
acetonitrile v/v, 0.1% acetic acid v/v) plus 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were
loaded onto a C18 capillary trap cartridge (LC Packings) and then separated on a 15-cm
nanoflow C18 column (PepMap 75 m id, 3 m, 100 Å) (LC Packings). The HPLC
instrument and the quadrupole time-of-flight (QSTAR Elite) MS system were the same as
previously described.64 The instrument was operated in an information-dependent data
acquisition mode where a MS scan followed by three MS/MS scans of four highest
abundance peptide ions were acquired in each cycle.

The MS/MS Data were processed by a thorough search considering biological modifications
against an IPI human database using the paragon algorithm (Shilov et al., 2007) of
ProteinPilot v4.0 software suite (Applied Biosystems).
For relative protein quantification using iTRAQ, only MS/MS spectra unique to a particular
protein and where the sum of the signal-to-noise ratio for all of the peak pairs >9 were used
for quantification (software default settings, Applied Biosystems). The mean, s.d., and Pvalues to estimate statistical significance of the protein changes were calculated by
ProGroup.
