ABSTRACT
Advances in financial engineering are radically reshaping the biomedical
marketplace. For instance, new methods of pooling diversified drug development
programs by placing them in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) have been proposed to
create a securitized cancer megafund allowing for debt and equity participation. In
this study, we perform theoretical and numerical simulations that highlight the role
of empirical validation of the projects comprising a cancer megafund. We quantify the
degree to which the deliberately designed structure of derivatives and investments is
key to its liquidity. Research megafunds with comprehensive in silico and laboratory
validation protocols and ability to issue both debt, and equity as well as hybrid
financial products may enable conservative investors including pension funds and
sovereign government funds to profit from unique securitization opportunities. Thus,
while hedging investor's longevity risk, such well-validated megafunds will contribute
to health, wellbeing and longevity of the global population.

INTRODUCTION

spread the risks associated with any stand-alone biomedical
project. The resulting lowered default probabilities could
make returns attractive to investors. By issuing Researchbacked Obligations (RBOs), it could be also possible to
attract both fixed-income and equity investors.
In parallel, a comprehensive multi-period, multistate program was developed to simulate the behavior
of the megafund entity over time and stress test the
conceptual framework. Fagnan et al. [3] extended it in
a way that demonstrated that third-party guarantees can
improve the economics of RBO transactions at very low
costs. The megafund concept was then extended to orphan
diseases [4] and to longevity hedge instruments [5]. The
approach received criticism with calls made for more
mathematically rigorous and faithful modeling, which
could result in structuring and simulating the megafund
entities to better elucidate and engineer risk profiles [6].
One alternative is to group investments to attract
a diverse investor base. The original cancer megafund
concept proposed offloading assets into one (SPV), a
commonly used type of legal structure to make the link

Biomedicine faces a dilemma. Despite many recent
scientific breakthroughs demonstrating a clear potential
for combating cancer, there has been no significant private
investment in cancer drug R&D. Both constantly rising
costs and increasing rates of failures in the late stages
of clinical trials have made the pharmaceutical R&D
unappetizingly risky from a financial perspective [1].
In particular, there are two main challenges. First,
on average the success rate of clinical trials is low so
that the average financial yield is low. Second, the large
investments required to bring a single treatment to the
market lead to an all-or-nothing result: the risk is high.
To increase funding for cancer research while providing
adequate financial returns to investors with wide ranging
risk profiles by investing in multiple clinical trials at
once thereby mutualizing investments and diluting risks,
the concept of a “cancer megafund” was proposed [2]. A
massive amount of investment capital would support a
portfolio of many drug development projects in order to

between investors and the users of investments such as
pharmaceutical companies, without considering the
heterogeneity of the drug development programs. In
practice, drug development programs may typically be
housed under different SPVs to attract diverse investors.
For example, some investors may prefer investing in
immunotherapy and others may prefer investing in small
molecules tethered to nanoparticles. Another major
challenge of operating in the real world is the presence
of “lemons” [7] in drug development programs, where
projects have flaws known to their promoters but not to the
buyers which can be modeled as information asymmetric
games with potential for deceptive Nash equilibria. It
is suspected that drug discovery and development is a
“lemons” market, where over half of results may be nonreproducible in part due to the complexity of experimental
conditions, the pressure to publish, low statistical powers
and difficulty to publish negative results [8]. Therefore,
while there are many efforts to consolidate knowledge [9],
it might be expected that lemons are a practical important
factor to consider when devising a megafund.
Through stylized examples, this study demonstrates
how the introduction of “lemons” and their distributions
influence the profits gained from different tranches: an
“ideal” megafund discarding lemons before they are
included into SPVs, a “reliable” megafund distributing the
lemons evenly in the megafund and an “unfair” megafund
greedily maximizing short term profit by placing lemons into
toxic SPVs. Because proposed drug development projects
are not a typical financial asset, we demonstrate that careful
“validation” of their quality can in the best case lead to a
better selection of what programs to develop and in the worst
case lead an unfair megafund to better create toxic SPVs.
Our stylized “ideal” megafund does not fund any
lemon at all. This is a hypothetical fund utilizing rigorous
validation mechanisms and enough substantial time and
resources to scrutinize every project before including it
into an SPV. Table 1 shows that an ideal megafund has
very low risks and very high financial returns and that
making several SPVs of about 50 drug development
programs enjoys many attractive traits. In addition to
attracting different types of investors, it is optimal from
the financial perspective.
Our stylized “reliable” megafund does not perform
extensive due diligence like the ideal megafund but will
randomly choose “lemons” alongside other projects and
distribute them evenly among SPVs. The case of a single
SPV then corresponds to the case studied by Fernandez
et al. [2] and indeed Table 1 shows that low risks and
potentially sufficient returns can be obtained when
pooling 150 assets. Making several SPVs to attract diverse
investors generates non negligible risks in senior tranches,
thus making one naturally wonder if returns can be high
enough to attract investors.
Our stylized “unfair” megafund shows that the
situation can rapidly deteriorate with multiple SPVs as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

after diligent examinations the managers of the megafund
may identify the set of lemons and be incentivized to not
pool assets completely randomly. As indicated by Sanjeev
Arora et al. [10], a strategy is to over represent the number
of lemon projects in a few SPVs, thereby skewing the
probability of default while making it computationally
intractable to detect the toxic SPVs. Other SPVs would
be handled in the same way as with the reliable megafund.
Table 1 shows that equity tranches would then perform
better than in the reliable megafund but that senior
tranches would massively default. If the megafund
managers hold shares of equity tranches, as generally done
for the sake of credibility and responsibility, when facing
lemons they would actually be tempted to manage the fund
in an unfair way.
Average annual yield and probability of loss of
senior and equity tranches, for a megafund of 150 drug
development programs that aims to serve a respectable return
to senior tranches, strongly depend on the type of megafund.
These statistics suggest using validation mechanisms to get
closer to an ideal megafund. The underlying mathematics
and parameters are in the next section.
The results in Table 1 clearly indicate that it
would be ideal to eliminate lemons beforehand. Such a
validation-based strategy may actually be feasible at a
certain cost: initial in vitro, in vivo and in silico intense
“validation” could filter some lemons out. It could also
improve the knowledge on how to develop non-lemons:
what population to target, the way of administration and
the dosage all jointly maximizing some measures of
benefit/risk. It can therefore be expected that investing
in such validation methods can greatly improve the
performance of megafunds.
In order to investigate such aspects, we used the
simulation framework of Fernandez et al. [2] and its
extension by Fagnan et al. [3]. We further extended it
to model multiple SPVs, to distinguish lemons from
non-lemons, to model the three behaviors of megafunds
described above and to model the impact of initially
investing in validation. The results are in Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows the average yields (A and B) and
default probabilities (C and D) for respectively senior and
equity tranches over 20,000 simulated paths for an ideal
megafund (light gray lines), a reliable megafund (dark gray
lines) and an unfair megafund, depending on the degree of
validation (as a percentage of the total investment; x-axis).
As expected, validation reduces risks and improves returns
for ideal and reliable megafunds; here, it turns some
poorly attractive fund into strongly attractive funds. In
case of an unfair management however, the knowledge of
where lemons are lead the fund managers to collect them
into toxic SPVs, which makes the corresponding senior
tranches very risky. Using a portion of the investments for
a validation process that could for example be strongly
data driven (E) may significantly improve the performance
of the fund by reducing the number of lemons.

To allow readers to analyze their own preferred
parameters, we uploaded the simulation software in the
public domain with an open-source license to run, modify
and distribute the code and provided the mathematical
model in the next section. One can choose higher returns
for senior tranches or otherwise adjust other parameters
or mechanisms. Figure 1 however already points to the
main conclusion of the paper: the behavior of a cancer
megafund strongly depends on the science behind its
assets and on the transparency about lemons; treating
lemons flippantly can be catastrophic.

Equity tranches in practice

Equity tranches in practice

As for Akerlof’s original model of used car markets
[7] or even the 2008 credit crunch crisis, knowing the quality
of assets and behaving in an informed manner with respect
to bad assets are crucial practical aspects of a megafund. As
a market of megafunds emerges, investors, lacking means to
distinguish the type of a megafund [10], may choose either
not to participate or to demand lower prices. Similarly to
the “lemon” market for used automobiles, ideal and reliable
megafunds that perform costly investigations will then be
expelled from the market by low cost deceptive megafunds
that fund deceptive biomedical research.

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH

Computing financial characteristics of a reliable
megafund

Overview

Payoff of senior tranches

We start by modelling a reliable megafund with
several SPVs. A series of stylized assumptions are taken
for simplicity. Examples of parameters are given for
clarity.
Having a single SPV (M = 1) is then simply
a special, but particularly interesting case. An ideal
megafund (no lemon: n = 0) is another interesting special
case.
The unfair megafund can be viewed as a
combination of two reliable megafunds for the senior
tranches and as a reliable fund with slight adaptations for
the equity tranches.

The total investment in the megafund is NI:
the product of the number investments N and the
amount invested in each I. It is split across SPVs and
across tranches so the investment for a senior tranch is
NI
I senior =
s . The senior tranche pays I senior (1 + r )T to
M
its investors if there are enough successes in the SPV to
do so. If there are not enough successes, i.e. if the senior
BN
tranche defaults, the few successes each pay
to the
MD
investors (because as seen above each drug development
program is split across M D / N SPVs).

Modelling a reliable megafund

Default of senior tranches

Drug development programs, lemons and SPVs

The frontier between the two cases determines
the probability of default d senior : when k successes that
pay as much as what the senior tranche shall pay in the
BN
absence of default i.e.
=
k
( NIs / M )(1 + r )T . The
MD
number of successes must be an integer so we round k up

As an example, out of 300 investigated drug
development programs a reliable megafund selects
N = 150 of them, and distributes them uniformly across
M = 10 SPVs of D = 50 drug development programs each.
Let us consider for simplicity that each drug development
program is shared across the same number of SPVs, which
is then M D/N.
Out of all, we assume that n = 75 drug development
programs are in fact lemons and that for simplicity their
success rate is 0. The other half is non-lemons, their
success rate is p = 10% (so that the combined average
success rate is 5% as in [2]). In case a non-lemon succeeds
it generates B = 12.3 millions of present value at T = 10
years (for simplicity). We assume that the upfront
investment is I = 0.2 million for every drug development
project, whether a lemon or not.

where NL = D N − n is the number of non lemons

Senior tranche and equity tranche
In order to attract both fixed-income and equity
investors, s = 50% of the investment capital of any
SPV goes to a senior tranche and the remaining part
(1 − s =
50%) to an equity tranche. For simplicity, each
SPV contains two tranches. After ten years, the senior
tranche pays the gains of the SPV up to the initial
investment plus an interest that corresponds to an r = 5%
annual interest rate. We say that the senior tranche
“defaults” if it is not able to pay that interest rate.
The remaining gains are spread to the equity
tranches of all SPVs as if it was a unique equity tranche
(method that reduces the risk of equities). The equity
amount is then paid to its investors. If it is below the
capital invested in the equity tranche we say that the latter
“defaults”.

The analysis for single SPV megafunds can then
be slightly simplified by setting M = 1 and D = N in

particular is simple as indicated in the previous section.

That calculation is complicated in the general case
so we performed case by case calculations.
The calculation is simple in the case of a megafund

A number k of successes occur within the whole

must be subtracted from that value in order to consider
how much value remains for equity – that is where the

and parameters to evaluate it and calculate its cost as in
the previous work.
It should be noted at this point that lemons
have a different transition probability matrix from
non-lemons. For non-lemons we use the same matrix
as Fernandez et al. [2] as a reasonable assumption
in the absence of validation (impacts of validation
are described below). We designed the transition
probability matrix of lemons based on the principle
that lemons have much higher probability of failures
and that the more stages they reach, the higher is the
probability and cost of failure.
We introduce multiple SPVs and the behavior of
the megafund: ideal, reliable or unfair. By default we start
with 200 assets and consider that half of them are lemons.
The ideal megafund starts by eliminating the lemons and
therefore starts with N = 100 . The reliable fund eliminates
some of the lemons depending on the amount invested in
validation and therefore starts with N between 100 and
200. The unfair fund keeps the N = 200 assets; in the
absence of validation it behaves like the reliable fund (not
able to distinguish between lemons and non-lemons) but
the more the validation, the more it distributes lemons into
some SPVs, the toxic SPVs. M = N / 4 SPVs are built.
Each SPV randomly chooses D = N / 2 assets, where
some asset will be distributed across a few SPVs, others
across many SPVs: the only constraint is that each asset
goes to at least one SPV. The unfair megafund uses a
quarter of its SPVs as toxic SPVs.
The probability to detect that an asset is a lemon
is modelled depending on the percentage of investments
used for validation: pdetection = 1 − e −10v . With that formula
it is 0 in the absence of validation and close to 95% when
30% of investments go to validation.
With validation also comes improvements of nonlemon probabilities. Indeed performing preliminary
analysis on drugs should allow to better target a dose, way
of administration and target population with a high benefit
to risk balance.
The mechanism of tranches is minimally modelled
for the sake of clarity of analysis. No junior tranche is
used: we only model the senior tranche and the equity
tranche. In case a senior tranche does not default it pays at
the end of the period and the senior tranche pays nothing
if it defaults.

The same reasoning as for a reliable megafund leads
exactly to the same formulas.

Equity default probability
A long formula could be established by considering
the three-dimensional enumeration of how many senior
tranches default in the two sub-megafunds and how many
excess successes are generated in the group of SPVs
whose senior tranches do not default. We instead use the
approximation concept used for a reliable megafund, it
leads to the same formula.

SIMULATIONS
As with the work of Fagnan et al. [3], we focused
only on early-stage investment (Preclinical and Phase I),
which is the most risky portion of the drug development
process and where funding is scarce. We selected one
semester as the time step of the study and 6 years as the
duration of the drug development process. During one
semester, drugs have probabilities to move to another
stage of the drug development process. At the end of
each semester, current cash reserves will increase through
the compound interest transferring to the next stage. We
used the same methods as those used by Fernandez to
make upfront payments and periodic payments and also
to compensate the developers for successful completion
of key milestones. If a drug successfully transfers into
Phase II or other later stages, we sell it and realize profits
immediately. For every drug, we used the same methods

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the megafund concept based on
modern securitization techniques and debt and equity
financing may provide another mechanism to accelerate
drug discovery in cancer and other diseases. However,
for the concept to be effective, it needs to consider the
economics of the lemons market in cancer research.
Considering the amount of irreproducible research
published in high-level journals, it is fair to assume that

asymmetry of information will exist between scientists,
managers and investors. Introducing stringent in silico
and laboratory validation techniques prior to enrolling
projects into SPVs may improve the odds of clinical trials.
A potential security mechanism would be that regulators

impose that a significant percentage of the upfront costs
go to drug discovery program validation and that results of
investigations are openly shared with both debt and equity
investors – this might also improve the reproducibility of
biomedical research.
