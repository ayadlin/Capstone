Abstract
Semaphorin-3B (sema3B) and semaphorin-3F (sema3F) are
secreted tumor suppressors of lung cancer. Sema3F functions
as an antiangiogenic factor that repels endothelial cells and
compromises their proliferation/survival. However, tumor
cells expressing either endogenous or recombinant sema3B
fail to repel endothelial cells efficiently. Sema3B found in the
conditioned medium of such cells is almost completely cleaved
by furin-like pro-protein convertases, generating inactive 61and 22-kDa fragments. We have generated a sema3B variant
that was point mutated at the cleavage site (sema3B-m),
thereby conferring partial resistance to cleavage. Conditioned
medium from HEK293 cells expressing sema3b-m and conditioned medium of HEK293 cells expressing sema3B contained
similar concentrations of semaphorin but sema3B-m was
cleaved much less than sema3B. In contrast to HEK293 cells
expressing native sema3B, cells expressing sema3b-m strongly
repel endothelial cells. Conditioned medium from sema3B-m–
expressing cells rapidly caused disassembly of focal adhesions
and a collapse of the actin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells,
inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor–induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2,
induced apoptosis of endothelial cells, and inhibited the
formation of tubes from endothelial cells in an in vitro
angiogenesis assay more potently than conditioned medium
from cells expressing sema3B. Furthermore, HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor–
induced angiogenesis in vivo much more potently than cells
expressing sema3B. Repulsion of human umbilical vascular
endothelial cells by sema3B-m was mediated primarily by the
neuropilin-1 (np1) receptor but sema3B-m was also able to
transduce signals via neuropilin-2 (np2). These results suggest
that up-regulation of furin-like pro-protein convertases in
malignant cells may enable tumors to evade the antiangiogenic effects of sema3B. [Cancer Res 2008;68(17):6922–31]

Introduction
The transition from a dormant nonangiogenic small tumor to an
expanding angiogenesis-promoting tumor is known as the
angiogenic switch; it is a crucial step in tumor progression and is
believed to be induced by up-regulation of proangiogenic factors or
by down-regulation of angiogenic inhibitors (1).

Semaphorins are axon guidance factors that induce localized
collapse of neuronal growth cones (2). The seven class-3
semaphorins are the only secreted vertebrate semaphorins. Like
all semaphorins, they contain an NH2-terminal sema domain
required for bioactivity and are distinguished by the presence of a
basic domain at their COOH termini. Except for sema3E, class 3
semaphorins bind to one or to both of the receptors belonging to
the neuropilin family. Neuropilins do not transduce semaphorin
signals on their own but associate with type A or type D plexins,
which serve as the signal-transducing elements in neuropilin/
plexin holoreceptors (3–5). The neuropilins also function as
receptors for several forms of the angiogenic factor vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are expressed in endothelial
cells (6–8). In addition to their indispensable role in axon guidance
and central nervous system development, the neuropilins were also
found to play important roles in developmental angiogenesis as
revealed by gene-targeting experiments (9, 10). Recently, it has been
found that the class-3 semaphorins (i.e., sema3A, sema3F, and
sema3E) display antiangiogenic properties (11–13). Experiments in
which the native np1 receptor of mice was replaced by a np1
variant that binds VEGF but not sema3A indicate that the
cardiovascular developmental abnormalities observed in mice
lacking functional np1 receptors are probably caused by impaired
VEGF signal transduction rather than by impaired semaphorin
signaling (14, 15).
The genes encoding sema3B and sema3F were identified as
tumor suppressor genes that are deleted or inactivated in lung
cancer (16, 17). Expression of sema3B in HEY ovarian carcinoma
cells inhibits tumor development from these cells (18). Recently, it
was observed that hypermethylation of the sema3B promoter
occurs in most cases of hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas at a relatively early stage of tumor progression (19).
Conditioned medium of recombinant sema3B-expressing cells
inhibited the proliferation of several breast and lung cancer–
derived cell lines, indicating that secreted sema3B can directly
affect the proliferation of cancer cells (20). Studies conducted using
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that express primarily np1 suggest
that sema3B uses np1 as its receptor (20); however, recent studies
suggest that sema3B can also use np2 (21).
Pro-protein convertases (PPC) constitute a family of nine
calcium-dependent serine endoproteases. The best studied member of the family is furin. PPCs cleave their substrates after the
consensus motif RXK/RR. The minimal recognition site for PPCs is
RXXR but the presence of a basic amino acid (K/R) in the third
position greatly enhances processing (22). PPCs are often overexpressed in cancer cells and are known to contribute to
tumorigenesis by proteolytic activation of precursors of protumorigenic factors such as insulin like growth factor-1 and its receptor,
transforming growth factor-h; VEGF-C; and metalloproteases such

Pro-Protein Convertases Inactivate Semaphorin-3B

as MT1-MMP, which plays an important role in the induction of
tumor invasiveness and tumor metastasis (22).
All class-3 semaphorins contain PPC recognition sites. The
major PPC cleavage site is a KRRXRR sequence that is conserved in
all the class 3 semaphorins. Cleavage at this site generates an NH2terminal fragment of f60 kDa. The cleaved NH2-terminal fragment
of sema3A is inactive (23) but the corresponding NH2-terminal
cleavage product of sema3E displays potent prometastatic activity
(24). Two more potential processing sites are located near the
COOH terminus of all class-3 semaphorins. Cleavage of sema3A at
these COOH-terminal sites increased its repulsive activity for
neuronal growth cones, indicating that cleavage at these sites may
result in the potentiation of class 3 semaphorin activity (23).
We report that sema3B functions as a repellent of endothelial
cells. However, sema3B is highly susceptible to degradation by
PPCs and is inactivated by PPC-mediated cleavage at the major site
of cleavage. We show that the conditioned medium of many types
of malignant cells contains cleaved inactivated sema3B. We also
show that a sema3B variant containing mutations at the major PPC
cleavage site of sema3B displays increased resistance to cleavage
and that cells expressing this mutated sema3B repel endothelial
cells more effectively than cells expressing similar amounts of
native sema3B. Furthermore, the mutated sema3B inhibits basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)–induced angiogenesis more
efficiently than native sema3B despite the limited protection
afforded by the mutation. Our results indicate that cleavage of
sema3B by up-regulated PPCs of cancer cells is a possible
mechanism by which tumors evade the antiangiogenic effects of
sema3B, thereby contributing to tumor progression.

Materials and Methods

tag, as well as chemicals, were from Sigma. Mediums and sera for cell
culture were from Biological-Industries, Inc. Oligofectamine was from
Invitrogen-Life Technologies. Antibodies directed against sema3B, Np1, Np2,
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and
ERK2 (total ERK) were from Santa Cruz, Inc. The antibody against active
caspase-3 was from MBL. The antibody against vinculin was from
Chemicon International. The anti–VSV-G antibody was from ICL. The furin
inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-CMK was from Alexis Biochemicals. The fluorescent vital dye DiAsp and Alexa-conjugated phalloidin were from Molecular
Probes. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and Strataclean
beads were from Stratagene. Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies
were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. bFGF was produced as
previously described (25). Matrigel was from BD Biosciences. The cDNA
encoding Sema3B was kindly donated by Dr. Susan Naylor (University of
Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). The NSPI-CMV-MCS-mycHis lentiviral expression vector was constructed as follows: a linker
containing the restriction enzymes NsiI-XbaI-BstBI-MluI-ClaI and SalI was
inserted between the ClaI and SalI sites of pRRL SIN cPPT PGK GFP. A
cassette containing SV40 promoter driving puromycin selection marker was
digested from pBabe-puro using AccI and ClaI and cloned into the BstBI
site. PGK-GFP cassette was then inserted into the ClaI and SalI sites to
generate NSPI-PGK-GFP. CMV promoter with multiple cloning sites (MCS)
was digested from pCDNA3.1+ Neo (Invitrogen) using MluI and XhoI,
replacing the PGK-GFP to generate NSPI-CMV-MCS. Last, we replaced the
original CMV promoter with a CMV promoter containing the MCS and myc
His cassette from pCDNA3.1-myc/His (Invitrogen) using MluI and PmeI to
generate NSPI-CMV-MCS-myc-His.
Expression plasmids. The VSV-G tag encoding sequence was inserted in
frame just before the stop codon of sema3B (COOH-terminal tag). The
modified sema3B cDNAs were cloned into the NSPI-CMV-MCS-myc-His
lentiviral expression vector. The modification in the furin-processing site

www.aacrjournals.org

exchanging RFRR with KFKK was introduced into sema3B to generate
sema3B-m using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the
instructions of the vendor. The primers used were 5¶-CCAGTGCCAAGAGGAAGTTCAAGAAGCAAGACGTAAGGAATGG-3¶ and the complementarily
reverse primer. The truncated sema3B forms were generated by PCR
amplification of appropriate sema3B cDNA fragments and a FLAG epitope
tag was inserted in frame before the stop codon. The various cDNAs
encoding the sema3B variants were all subcloned into the NSPI-CMV-MCSmyc-His lentiviral expression vector. Full-length sema3B-m containing the
COOH-terminal FLAG tag inserted in frame just before the stop codon
instead of the VSV-G tag was also cloned into the NSPI-CMV-MCS-myc-His
and served as a control in experiments using the truncated sema3B
variants.
Generation of recombinant lentiviruses. HEK293-T cells were seeded
in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (2.5  106 cells per dish). A day after
seeding, the cells were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate method with
the lentiviral expression plasmid (15 Ag), packaging vector pCMVdR8.91
(10 Ag), and a plasmid encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus coat envelope
pMD2-VSVG (5 Ag). Conditioned medium containing infective lentiviral
particles was collected 48 and 72 h posttransfection.
Cells. Human umbilical vascular endothelial (HUVEC), porcine aortic
endothelial (PAE), and HEK293 cells were cultured as previously described
(11). HUVEC were used between passages 3 to 7. DU145 prostate cancer
cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. WW94, YU-ZAZ6,
and SW1416 melanoma cells were grown in medium containing a mixture
of F12 and low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. All the
other cell lines were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS.
Western blots. Cell lysates and Western blots were done as described (26).
Preparation of sema3B-containing conditioned medium. HEK293
cells expressing different forms of sema3B or control empty vector–infected
HEK293 cells were grown to 70% confluence and incubated subsequently
for 24 h with HUVEC growth medium (11) supplemented with 10% FCS ( for
ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays) or 20% FCS ( for all the other assays). The
proliferation rates of control, empty vector–infected HEK293 cells, and cells
expressing either sema3B or sema3B-m were identical (data not shown).
Endothelial cell repulsion and proliferation/survival assays. Cell
proliferation/survival assays were performed by counting surviving cells as
described (26). The results of these assays are influenced on the one hand by
effects on cell proliferation and on the other hand by proapoptotic effects
and represent an integration of the two mechanisms. Repulsion assays were
done as described (26, 27).
Immunofluorescence. Detection of vinculin and actin in HUVEC was
performed essentially as described (26).
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The effects of sema3B-m on VEGF121- and
VEGF165-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation were determined essentially as
described (11).
Down-regulation of neuropilin expression in HUVEC using small
interfering RNA. Inhibition of np1 and np2 expression in HUVEC was
performed as previously described (26) using the np1-specific small
interfering RNA (siRNA) r(AAGGAAACCUUGGUGGGAU)d(TT) and the
np2-specific siRNA r(CCAGAAGAUUGUCCUC AAC)d(TT) or a control
siRNA r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)dTdT.
Caspase-3 apoptosis assay. The assay was performed as previously
described (26).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the upaired
data with unequal variance Student’s t test. Error bars represent the SE.
Statistical significance is presented as *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001.

Results
Native as well as recombinant Sema3B produced by various
types of tumorigenic cells is cleaved by furin-like PPCs. Sema3F
is an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, a repellent of
endothelial cells, and an inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis
(11, 26, 27). To find out if sema3B also functions as a repellent of

endothelial cells, we expressed the native sema3B cDNA or a
sema3B cDNA containing an in-frame vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV-G) epitope tag at the COOH terminus (sema3B-VSV) in
HEK293 cells using recombinant lentiviruses. However, although
recombinant sema3B was efficiently expressed, we could only
detect weak repulsion of HUVEC compared with the repulsion
obtained using cells expressing sema3A (Fig. 1A). When we
examined the conditioned medium of the cells using antibodies
directed against the NH2 terminus of sema3B, we found that the
sema3B was almost completely cleaved, yielding a single f60 kDa
NH2-terminal fragment (Fig. 1B, a), leaving very little intact
full-length 83 kDa sema3B. A similar f60 kDa cleaved sema3B
fragment was revealed by the same antibody in conditioned
medium derived from HEK293 cells expressing native, untagged
sema3B (data not shown). The antibody used to detect the NH2
terminus of sema3B does not detect the COOH-terminal cleavage
product. This product was seen as a f20 kDa fragment in the

conditioned medium of the cells using antibodies directed against
the COOH-terminal VSV epitope tag (Fig. 1B, b). A similar f60 kDa
cleavage product was also observed when transfection rather than
viral infection was used to express the recombinant sema3B (data
not shown). Throughout this work, we have mainly used the
COOH-terminal tagged sema3B. It did not differ in biological
properties from untagged sema3B and we therefore refer to it from
now on as sema3B.
All class-3 semaphorins contain a major conserved cleavage site
for furin-like PPCs. Cleavage at this site (Fig. 3B, site 1) generates an
f60 kDa NH2-terminal fragment and an f20 kDa COOH-terminal
fragment (23, 24), suggesting that the f60 kDa cleavage product
observed in the conditioned medium of sema3B-expressing
HEK293 cells is also the product of PPC activity. When the activity
of furin-like PPC of HEK293 cells expressing recombinant sema3B
was inhibited with the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-CMK (24, 28),
the cleavage of sema3B was partially inhibited, leading to the

cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm culture dishes and incubated for 48 h with 7 mL serum-free medium. The conditioned medium was collected and incubated
for 2 h at 4jC with 30 AL of Strataclean beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation, boiled in 30 AL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the released proteins
were separated on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies directed against sema3B. Nonconcentrated serum-free conditioned
medium (30 AL) derived from HEK293 cells expressing recombinant sema3B and sema3B-m was used as a positive control. b, YU-ZAZ6 cells were incubated
with (+) or without ( ) 200 Amol/L decanoyl-RVKR-CMK for 24 h. Conditioned medium (2 mL) from the cells was collected and incubated for 2 h at 4jC with 30 AL of
Strataclean beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation, boiled in 30 AL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the released proteins were separated on a 8%
SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies directed against sema3B.

were incubated before seeding with 5 Ag/mL of the fluorescent vital dye DiAsp for 30 min. They were seeded on top of confluent HUVEC cells and a repulsion assay was
performed as previously described (26). Arrows, HEK293 cells labeled with fluorescent DiAsp. The cells were photographed 48 h after seeding. The areas of such
denuded fields (15 for each HEK293 type) were measured using the Image Pro Plus software and normalized to the number of the semaphorin-expressing cells.

secretion of a mixture of full-length sema3B and cleaved sema3B
(Fig. 1B, c). To find out if sema3B undergoes degradation in
additional types of cancer cells, we expressed recombinant sema3B
in several types of malignant cells that do not produce endogenous
sema3B. These included MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HA188
lung cancer cells, A549 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1C, a), and H661 lung
cancer cells (Fig. 2A, b). The conditioned medium of these cells
contained cleaved sema3B, and we could not detect full-length
sema3B in them. To make sure that the cleavage was indeed caused
by PPCs, we inhibited the PPC activity of the MDA-MB-231 cells
using decanoyl-RVKR-CMK. The inhibitor was somewhat toxic
to these cells and caused a decrease in the total amount of
recombinant sema3B that was secreted into the medium; however,
it can be seen that cleavage was inhibited and that, in the presence
of the inhibitor, full-length sema3B was secreted from the cells
(Fig. 1C, b). To find out if natural sema3B is cleaved by PPCs of
cancer cells, we screened several types of malignant melanoma,
colon cancer, and prostate cancer–derived cell lines. Several of
these produced and secreted sema3B into their growth medium.
However, the secreted sema3B was completely or almost
completely cleaved in the conditioned medium of these cells
(Fig. 1D, a). To make sure that the cleavage of native sema3B was
caused by furin-like enzymes, we inhibited the cleavage in one of

www.aacrjournals.org

the melanomas using the inhibitor. Indeed, the inhibition partially
prevented the cleavage (Fig. 1D, b).
Tumorigenic cells expressing a sema3B mutant that is
partially resistant to degradation by PPCs strongly repel
endothelial cells. Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK inhibited the activity of
furin-like PPCs in the tumorigenic cells but compromised the
proliferation/survival of HUVEC (data not shown). To enable the
examination of the effects of sema3B on endothelial cells, we
generated a sema3B mutant resistant to degradation by PPCs by
the introduction of point mutations into the major PPC cleavage
site (Fig. 3B, site 1). We found that nonconservative mutations of
arginine residues within the RFRR sequence found at this site
resulted in the production of sema3B mutants that were almost
completely resistant to cleavage but displayed strongly reduced
biological activity (data not shown). We therefore mutated the
amino acids of site 1 conservatively from RFRR to KFKK to
generate the sema3B mutant sema3B-m (Fig. 3B). Conditioned
medium of sema3B-m–expressing HEK293 cells contained a higher
concentration of full-length sema3B-m and much less of the f60
kDa cleavage product (Fig. 2A, a), indicating that the point
mutations confer partial resistance to cleavage by PPCs. Similarly,
when sema3B-m was expressed in H661 lung cancer cells or in
MDA-MB-231 cells that degrade sema3B more aggressively than

HEK293 cells, we found that their conditioned medium now
contained full-length sema3B-m, although most of the sema3B-m
was still cleaved (Fig. 2A, b and c).
The conditioned medium of the sema3B-m–expressing HEK293
cells also contained sema3B-derived fragments significantly larger
than f60 kDa but of lower molecular weight than the full-length
sema3B-m (Fig. 2A, a). Similar fragments were also found in the
conditioned medium of sema3B-m–expressing H661 lung cancer
cells (Fig. 2A, b). One of these fragments corresponds to the

f75 kDa degradation product also seen in conditioned medium of
sema3B-expressing HEK293 cells cultured in the presence of
decanoyl-RVKR-CMK (Fig. 1B and C). These fragments are likely
to be generated by furin-like PPC-mediated cleavage at secondary
putative PPC consensus cleavage sites located closer to the COOH
terminus of sema3B (Fig. 2B). To make sure that these fragments are
not the products of unrelated proteases, we inhibited the activity of
furin-like PPCs in HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m by using
decanoyl-RVKR-CMK. Under these conditions, the conditioned

of the six potential PPC cleavage sites. Potential cleavage sites are numbered starting from the most NH2-terminal site. The sequence of the potential PPC sites is

of sema3B, sema3B-m, and the three truncated sema3B forms are depicted below. C, a HUVEC repulsion assay was performed as described using either empty
vector–infected HEK293 cells (Cont. ), HEK293 cells expressing full-length sema3B-m (s3b-m), HEK293 cells expressing the truncated sema3B-m forms [s3bt(1-3)].
Arrows, DiAsp-labeled HEK293 cells. D, serum-free conditioned medium (CM ) derived from dishes containing equal concentrations of either control HEK293 cells
infected with control lentivirus or HEK293 cells producing sema3B-m (s3b-m ), s3bt2, or s3bt3 were diluted with fresh growth medium to a final concentration of 75%,
50%, 25%, 12.5%, or 6.25%, respectively. Equal aliquots were separated on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies directed
against sema3B (top left ) or against the FLAG epitope tag used to label the various sema3B-m–derived forms at their COOH termini (bottom left ). The intensity of
labeled bands in the blots was quantified using a Fuji Film image reader LAS-3000 machine with the help of the Multi-Gauge program supplied with the reader.
These data were used to quantify the relative concentration of the full-length forms present in the conditioned medium. To compare the biological activity of the various
forms, HUVEC were seeded in gelatinized 24-well dishes (2  104 cells per well). After the cell attachment, the medium was replaced with conditioned medium diluted to
final concentrations of 75%, 50%, 25%, and 12.5% with fresh HUVEC growth medium. The conditioned media were derived from the same cells that were used
in the panels on the left. In all cases, the conditioning was done under equal conditions. Adherent HUVEC cells were trypsinized and counted after 48 h using a
Coulter counter. The percentage of proliferation/survival inhibition relative to the same concentration of the control conditioned medium was calculated for each of the
sema3B-m forms at each of the dilutions and normalized according to the relative concentration of the forms using arbitrary concentration units (right ). One arbitrary
concentration unit equaled the concentration of full-length sema3B-m in the conditioned medium of the producing cells diluted to the final concentration of 12.5%
(determined by longer exposure of the Western blot). Points, average percentage of inhibition derived from two independent experiments; bars, SE. Each of the
experiments was performed in triplicate.

HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m repelled HUVEC much more
effectively than HEK293 cells expressing sema3B (Fig. 2C), although
the total amounts of sema3B-m and native sema3B found in the
conditioned medium of the producing cells were similar (Fig. 2A,
a). We also compared the effect of conditioned medium derived
from HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m, sema3B, or control cells
infected with empty expression vector on the proliferation/survival
of HUVEC. Conditioned medium derived from sema3B-expressing
HEK293 cells, which contains mainly the cleaved fragments, did not
compromise the proliferation/survival of HUVEC. In contrast,
conditioned medium of HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m
strongly inhibited the proliferation/survival of HUVEC (Fig. 2D).
These experiments indicate that full-length sema3B is active
whereas the major PPC cleavage products of sema3B are
substantially less active with respect to their effects on endothelial
cells.
Determination of the biological activity of sema3Bm–derived NH2-terminal fragments generated by PPC cleavage. To make sure that the f60 kDa fragment generated by
cleavage at site 1 of sema3B (Fig. 1B, a) is indeed inactive, we
generated a deletion mutant of sema3B in which we have inserted
an in-frame FLAG epitope tag followed by a stop codon just before
the site 1 cleavage site. This truncated sema3B fragment (s3bt1;
Fig. 3B) was expressed and secreted by HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A,
lane 1). S3bt1-expressing cells did not repel endothelial cells
(Fig. 3C) and did not inhibit their proliferation/survival (data not
shown), suggesting that the PPC-generated f60 kDa sema3B
product lacks biological activity.
When examining conditioned medium obtained from cells
expressing sema3B-m, we noticed the presence of sema3B-m
fragments larger than 60 kDa but smaller than full-length sema3Bm (Fig. 2A, a and b). These were apparently generated as a result of
cleavage at secondary PPC cleavage sites, which are apparently
used more extensively in sema3B-m due to the presence of the
mutations at the main cleavage site. Some of these fragments are
very close in molecular weight to full-length sema3B and may
originate from cleavage at the cluster of potential sites located f2
kDa upstream of the COOH-terminus (Fig. 3B, site 6), of which two
are conserved in the class 3 semaphorins (23, 24). To determine the
activity of NH2-terminal fragments generated by cleavage at these
closely clustered sites, we produced a truncated sema3B-m variant
(s3bt3) in which we inserted an in-frame FLAG epitope tag
followed by a stop codon just before site 6 (Fig. 3B), thereby
removing all these putative cleavage sites as well as the whole basic
box of sema3B. Although the concentration of s3bt3 in the
conditioned medium of producing HEK293 cells was higher than
the concentration of sema3B-m produced by expressing HEK293
cells (compare Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4), s3bt3-expressing cells
repelled HUVEC very weakly if at all (Fig. 3C). The f75 kDa
fragment that is observed in the conditioned medium of sema3Bm–expressing cells (Fig. 2B) is likely to be produced as a result of
cleavage at site 4 of sema3B (Fig. 3B). We therefore introduced into
the sema3B-m cDNA an in-frame FLAG epitope tag followed by a
stop codon just before the start of the expected cleavage site of site
4 (Fig. 3B) and expressed this cDNA in HEK293 cells to generate
sb3t2. S3bt2 was devoid of biological activity in the repulsion assay
(Fig. 3C) despite high expression levels (Fig. 3A, lane 2).

To compare the biological activities of the truncated sema3B-m
variants semiquantitatively, we compared the effects of conditioned medium containing sema3B-m or the three deletion
mutants (Fig. 3B) on the proliferation/survival of HUVEC. To
assess the concentration of the deletion mutants in the
conditioned medium of the producing HEK293 cells, we performed
serial dilutions of serum-free conditioned medium and assessed
the concentration of the fragments by Western blot analysis using
antibodies directed against sema3B (Fig. 3D, top left) or against the
FLAG epitope tag inserted in frame before the stop codon of the
mutants and the sema3B-m (Fig. 3D, bottom left). Sb3t1 (the f60
kDa fragment) was devoid of bioactivity in this assay too (data not
shown). The two other sema3B-m deletion mutants inhibited the
proliferation/survival of HUVEC, but less effectively than sema3Bm (Fig. 3D, right ). The results of these experiments were
normalized by taking into account the relative concentrations of
the secreted sema3B-m and sema3B-m deletion mutants as
determined in the Western blots using the anti-sema3B antibody
and a Fuji Film LAS-3000 image reader to assess relative band
densities (Fig. 3D, top left). By these criteria, the relative EC50 of
s3bt3 was 9.2 F 2.8-fold higher than that of sema3B-m and the
relative EC50 of s3bt2 was 57.5 F 7.5-fold higher than that of
sema3B-m (Fig. 3D, right). This estimate may be conservative
because cleavage at the site 6 cluster (Fig. 3B) can generate
sema3B-m fragments that the anti-sema3B antibody would not be
able to distinguish from full-length sema3B-m because there is only
an f2 kDa difference in mass. It is therefore possible that if such
truncations take place, our estimate of the relative activity of fulllength sema3B-m may be too low.
For this reason, we also assessed the relative activities of the
truncated forms based on relative concentration measurements
obtained using the anti-FLAG epitope tag (Fig. 3D, bottom left).
This antibody does not recognize cleaved sema3B-m or cleaved
truncated sema3B-m forms because the epitope tag is lost in these
forms. Using this antibody, we observed that the concentration of
full-length sema3B-m is much lower in relation to the concentrations of full-length s3bt2 and s3bt3 than the estimate obtained
with the sema3B antibody. Using the values obtained with this
antibody, we estimated that s3bt3 is f40-fold less active than fulllength sema3B-m, whereas s3bt2 is 1,200-fold less active (data not
shown). However, regardless of the method used, we conclude that
in contrast to sema3A, in which truncations near the COOHterminal result in enhanced activity (23), in sema3B even a
relatively minimal COOH-terminal truncation already results in
substantial loss of biological activity.
Sema3B signaling in HUVEC is mediated primarily by the np1
receptor. Previous work suggested that sema3B can signal using
both np1 and np2 (20, 21). To determine the relative contributions of
np1 and np2 in sema3B signal transduction in HUVEC, we selectively
inhibited the expression of these receptors using specific siRNAs.
Inhibition of np1 expression by f80% (Fig. 4A) resulted in a
substantial loss of responsiveness to sema3B-m in the endothelial
cell repulsion assay (Fig. 4B, b). In contrast, cells in which the
expression of np2 was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4A) were
still able to efficiently repulse HUVEC (Fig. 4B, c), indicating that in
HUVEC, the sema3B repulsive signals are primarily mediated by np1.
To find out if np2 is able to transduce sema3B signals in endothelial
cells, we determined if cells expressing sema3B-m are able to repulse
PAE cells engineered to coexpress np1 or np2 and plexin-A1 (Fig. 4C).
The sema3B-m–expressing HEK293 cells were able to repel the
np2/plexin-A1–expressing PAE cells as efficiently as they repelled

PAE cells coexpressing np1 and plexin-A1 (Fig. 4D), indicating that
sema3B can indeed transduce signals via np2. This experiment was
done in PAE cells because HUVEC contain relatively low concentrations of np2 and do not respond well to np2 agonists.
Additional effects of sema3B-m on cultured endothelial
cells. Exposure of HUVEC to conditioned medium taken from
sema3B-m–expressing 293 cells induced rapid disappearance of
focal contacts, disappearance of actin stress fibers, and cell
contraction within 20 minutes. In contrast, conditioned medium
from sema3B-expressing HEK293 cells induced only slight changes
(Fig. 5A).
VEGF is a proliferation/survival factor for endothelial cells
(29, 30). In contrast to sema3B, sema3B-m strongly inhibited
VEGF121 as well as VEGF165 induced activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5B
and C). It was reported that sema3B can induce apoptosis of
responsive tumor cells and that this effect is competitively
inhibited by VEGF165 but not by VEGF121 (20). Our results
indicate that in the case of endothelial cells, sema3B-m does not
act exclusively by competition with VEGF165 for binding to np1
but also seems to inhibit VEGF activity by induction of an
independent inhibitory signal as previously reported for sema3A

and sema3F (26). Prolonged stimulation with sema3B-m–containing conditioned medium, but not with sema3B–containing
conditioned medium, induced apoptosis of HUVEC as revealed
by a substantial increase in the concentration of activated
caspase-3 (Fig. 5D).
We also determined if sema3B-m can inhibit the formation of
tubes from endothelial cells, a process that is essential in
angiogenesis. HUVEC seeded on Matrigel organize into a
capillary-like network (31, 32). Conditioned medium containing
sema3B-m, but not conditioned medium containing a similar
concentration of sema3B, strongly inhibited the formation of this
capillary-like network (Fig. 6A).
HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m inhibit bFGF-induced
angiogenesis more potently than HEK293 cells expressing
similar concentrations of native sema3B. The effect that
sema3B-m has on the behavior of cultured endothelial cells
suggested that sema3B may function as an inhibitor of angiogenesis and that cleavage by PPCs may inhibit its antiangiogenic
activity. To test this hypothesis, we mixed control HEK293 cells as
well as sema3B- and sema3B-m–producing HEK293 cells with
Matrigel containing the angiogenic factor bFGF. The mixtures

Figure 4. The repulsion of HUVEC by sema3B is mediated mainly by Np1. A, HUVEC were transfected either with a np1-specific siRNA (si-Np1 ) or with a
siRNA directed against np2 (si-Np2 ). The cells were lysed as described 72 h following transfection. The cell lysates (40 Ag of protein per lane) were separated on a 6%
SDS-PAGE gel, blotted, and probed with antibodies directed against np1 or np2. To verify that the amount of protein in each lane is similar, the membrane was
subsequently stripped and reprobed with antibodies directed against h-actin. Labeled bands in the blots were detected using a Fuji Film image reader LAS-3000
machine. The relative intensity of the bands was quantified using the Multi-Gauge program. B, a repulsion assay was performed 24 h after transfection using the
siRNA-transfected HUVEC. Control cells were transfected with a control nonspecific siRNA (Si-C ). HEK293 cells expressing sema3B-m were labeled with the
fluorescent dye DiAsp and seeded on top of monolayers of siRNA-transfected HUVEC as described in Materials and Methods. Arrows, labeled HEK293 cells. C, cell
lysates (50 Ag lane) were prepared as described from PAE stably expressing Plexin A1 and Np1 (Np1PA1 ), Plexin A1 and Np2 (Np2PA1 ; lane 2 ), or Plexin A1 alone
(PA1). The lysates were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted, and probed with antibodies directed against np1 (aNp1 ) or np2 (aNp2 ). D, a repulsion assay
was performed using the PAE variants PA1, Np1PA1, or Np2PA1 as target cells. Control, empty vector–infected HEK293 cells (Cont. ) or HEK293 cells expressing
sema3B-m were labeled with the fluorescent dye DiAsp and seeded on top of monolayers of the designated PAE cells as described. Arrows, labeled HEK293 cells.

Figure 5. Characterization of the biological activity of sema3B-m on cultured endothelial cells. A, HUVEC grown to 80% confluence were incubated for 20 min with
conditioned medium from empty vector–infected HEK293 cells (Cont. ) or conditioned medium from HEK293 cells expressing either sema3B or sema3B-m. Focal
contacts were visualized using an antivinculin antibody as described in Materials and Methods (left three pictures ). The actin cytoskeleton was visualized using
Alexa-conjugated phalloidin (right three pictures ). The cells were photographed using a fluorescent microscope as described. The area of the cells stained with
Alexa-conjugated phalloidin was quantified using the Image Pro Plus software. Columns, average areas derived from the analysis of between 20 and 30 cells from
different microscopic fields; bars, SE. B, HUVEC were seeded in gelatinized six-well dishes (4.5  105 cells per well) in medium containing 10% FCS. After 16 h,
the medium was replaced with conditioned medium derived from control HEK293 cells (lanes 1, 2, and 5), from cells producing sema3B (lanes 3 and 6), or from
sema3B-m–producing cells (lanes 4 and 7). Following a 15-min preincubation at room temperature, either VEGF165 (3 ng/mL; lanes 2-4 ) or VEGF121 (25 ng/mL;
lanes 5-7 ) was added to cells. The experiment was terminated after z10 min. VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK ) was measured using anti-pERK
antibodies as described. The blot was stripped and total ERK1/2 was measured using an antibody directed against ERK2 (tERK ). The experiment was repeated
several times with similar results. C, the intensity of the bands in the blots shown in B was quantified using a Fuji Film image reader LAS-3000 machine with the help
of the Multi-Gauge program. The level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was normalized to the total ERK1/2 protein (pERK/tERK) for each treatment. D, HUVEC cells
(4.5  105 per well) were seeded in gelatinized six-well dishes. Following attachment, the medium was replaced with serum-free M199 medium (lane 1), with
conditioned medium from control HEK293 cells (lane 2), with conditioned medium from cells expressing sema3B (lane 3), with conditioned medium from cells
expressing sema3B-m (lane 4 ), or with M199 medium containing 20% serum (FCS) supplemented with 5 ng/mL bFGF (lane 5 ). Activation of caspase-3 was assayed as
described. To verify that the amount of protein in each lane was similar, the membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with antibodies directed against h-actin.

containing the different cell types were implanted s.c. in BALB/c
nu/nu mice and the blood vessels that invaded the Matrigel plugs
were quantified after 8 days. Although sema3B-expressing cells
reduced the number of blood vessels that invaded the plugs,
sema3B-m–expressing cells had a significantly stronger effect
(Fig. 6B). To compare the effect of sema3B and sema3B-m on
tumor development, we also expressed sema3B and sema3B-m in
MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells (Fig. 6C; ref. 33). These cells express
the sema3B receptor np2 (data not shown). The proliferation of the
cells in cell culture was not affected by the expression of sema3B or
sema3B-m (data not shown). However, both sema3B and sema3Bm inhibited the formation of these tumors relative to control MDAMB-435 cells more or less similarly (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Sema3B was identified, along with sema3F, as a tumor
suppressor that inhibits the development of small-cell lung
carcinoma (16, 17). Sema3F was subsequently characterized as
a repellent of endothelial cells and as an antiangiogenic factor
(11, 27). These findings suggested that part of the antitumorigenic
behavior of sema3B could perhaps be attributed to antiangiogenic
activity.
Surprisingly, HEK293 cells infected with lentiviral vectors
directing high-level expression of sema3B did not repel endothelial
cells efficiently. When we examined the conditioned medium of
these cells, we found that sema3B was almost completely cleaved
into two fragments of f60 and f20 kDa, suggesting that these

fragments are inactive. All the class-3 semaphorins contain a
conserved consensus PPC cleavage site that, when used, leads to
the production of f60 and f20 kDa fragments. In the case of
sema3A, cleavage at this site leads to loss of activity (23), whereas
cleavage of sema3E at this site results in the generation of an active
metastasis promoting f60 kDa fragment (24). However, the
recombinant f60 kDa NH2-terminal fragment of sema3B was
inactive. Furthermore, we have shown here that cleavage of sema3B
at secondary PPC cleavage sites also results in substantial loss of
activity. Interestingly, even the removal of a relatively small COOHterminal peptide of 2 kDa, which in the case of sema3A potentiates
sema3A activity, lead to a substantial loss of sema3B bioactivity.
Neither sema3A nor sema3F are efficiently cleaved by furin-like
PPCs of cancer cells and the cleaved semaphorins found in the
conditioned medium of sema3A- and sema3F-producing cancer
cells usually represent in our experience no more than 10% to 20%
of the total semaphorin found in the conditioned medium (11, 26,
27). In contrast, sema3B seems to be much more susceptible to

cleavage by PPCs of cancer cells. We have found several melanomaand colon cancer–derived cell lines that actively produce and
secrete sema3B; however, in all these cells, the secreted sema3B
was almost completely cleaved. This susceptibility suggests that in
the case of sema3B, cleavage by up-regulated PPCs of malignant
cells (22) may represent a major mechanism by which tumors
may evade the antiangiogenic effects of sema3B in addition to
down-regulation of expression and loss of heterozygosity (17,
34, 35). Indeed, HEK293 cells expressing the sema3B point mutant
sema3B-m, which confers partial resistance to cleavage by PPCs,
contain higher concentrations of full-length mutated sema3B in
their conditioned medium. These cells repel endothelial cells more
potently than HEK293 cells expressing native sema3B using a
mechanism that depends on the presence of neuropilins.
Furthermore, the full-length mutated sema3B found in their
conditioned medium induced the contraction of endothelial cells,
inhibited their proliferation/survival, induced apoptosis, inhibited
VEGF-induced activation of ERK1/2, and inhibited tube formation

Figure 6. Tumorigenic cells expressing sema3B-m inhibit bFGF-induced angiogenesis more effectively than cells expressing unmodified sema3B. A, to assess
the effects of sema3B and sema3B-m on tube formation from HUVEC, HUVEC were seeded in 48-well tissue culture plates (2  104 cells per well) coated with 150 AL
Matrigel in HUVEC growth medium conditioned by either control HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells producing sema3B or sema3B-m. The medium was diluted with
fresh HUVEC growth medium to a final concentration of 50%. After 16 h of incubation, the wells were photographed using phase-contrast microscopy at low
magnification. Columns, average number of bifurcation points in microscopic fields obtained from eight different wells in the case of the control and seven different wells
for sema-3B or sema3B-m; bars, SE. The experiment was repeated thrice with similar results. Left, pictures from a representative experiment. B, HEK293 cells
expressing either sema3B or sema3B-m or control HEK293 cells were mixed with Matrigel containing bFGF (300 ng/mL) to a final concentration of 2  106 cells/mL.
The mixtures were injected s.c. into balb/c nu/nu mice (0.5 mL/mouse) as described (11). Matrigel plugs were excised 8 d later, embedded in optimum cutting
temperature compound, and frozen in 2-methylbutane cooled by liquid nitrogen. They were then sectioned into 30-Am-thick sections using a cryostat. The sections were
blocked with cold acetone, reacted with an antibody directed against the endothelial marker CD-31, and counterstained with hematoxylin. The whole area of each
Matrigel section was subdivided into microscopic fields and photographed. The area of blood vessels in each microscopic field was quantified using the Image Pro Plus
software. The average blood vessels density for each section was calculated as the overall area of the blood vessels in the section divided by the number of microscopic
fields in the section, which represents the area of the section. Columns, average blood vessel density for eight different sections taken from four (for sema3B) or
five (for sema3B-m and control) different Matrigel plugs; bars, SE. C, conditioned medium (35 AL) from MDA-MB-435 cells expressing recombinant sema3B or
sema3B-m or from control, empty vector–infected MDA-MB-435 cells was separated on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel; blotted onto nitrocellulose; and probed with an
anti-sema3B antibody. D, MDA-MB-435 cells expressing either sema3B or sema3B-m or control MDA-MB-435 cells were implanted (7  106 per mouse) into the
mammary fat pads of 4- to 6-wk-old female balb/c nu/nu mice. The tumors were excised after 31 d and weighed. Columns, average weight of the tumors; bars, SE.

by endothelial cells much more potently than conditioned medium
containing a similar concentration of native sema3B. The
proliferation/survival assays represent the balance between effects
on cell proliferation and proapoptotic effects. It is possible that
these effects are only secondary to the effects on the cytoskeleton
and the adhesion and this will need to be examined in the future.
Last, HEK293 cells secreting sema3B-m inhibited in vivo angiogenesis significantly better than HEK293 cells secreting similar
amounts of native sema3B, suggesting that up-regulated furin-like
PPCs produced in cancer cells (22) may contribute to tumor
progression through inactivation of sema3B.
We also expressed sema3B and sema3B-m in MDA-MB-435
melanoma cells. In these cells, sema3B was cleaved by PPCs, but
less efficiently than in the HEK293 cells. Expression of both sema3B
and sema3B-m inhibited tumor formation similarly, although
sema3B-m was marginally more efficient. The difference in the
concentrations of full-length sema3B and sema3B-m found in the
conditioned medium of these cells is not as pronounced as in
the case of the HEK293 cells (compare Figs. 3A and 6C), which may
be the reason for the relatively efficient inhibition seen with native
sema3B. Furthermore, part of the inhibition may be due to a direct
in vivo effect on these np2-expressing tumor cells because in the
tumor, the local concentrations of sema3B to which the tumor cells
are exposed may suffice to inhibit efficiently tumor development.

To conclude, our results suggest that sema3B is an inhibitor of
angiogenesis. Our results further suggest that furin-like PPCs,
previously shown to contribute to tumor progression through
the activation of tumor-promoting enzymes and growth factors
(22), may also contribute to tumor progression through the
inactivation of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sema3B. Our
results further suggest that Sema3B variants displaying higher
resistance to PPC-mediated cleavage may perhaps find use as
antiangiogenic agents.
