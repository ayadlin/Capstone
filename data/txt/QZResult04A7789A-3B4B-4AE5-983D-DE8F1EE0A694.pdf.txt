ABSTRACT
To investigate the use of molecular testing on cytological specimens in
selecting advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are adequate
for targeted treatment, a total of 137 NSCLC cases were analyzed by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements,
and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (KRAS) mutations were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
platform combining amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) primers and
TaqMan probes. Cytological specimens included 91 fine-needle aspirates, 5 fibreoptic
bronchoscopic derived samples and 41 pleural effusions. Among 137 NSCLCs analyzed
for ALK FISH, 16 (11.7%, of 137) were detected to harbor ALK rearrangement. FISH
positive cases were all defined as adenocarcinoma (ADC) histologic subtype and the
FNA samples showed the highest ALK positive rate (13.2%, 12/91). Of the 9 ALK FISH
positive patients who received crizotinib treatment, 8 (88.9%) patients exhibited
tumor regression. In addition, 60 (44.8%, of 134) cases were found to harbor EGFR
mutations and 22 patients with EGFR sensitive mutations who received gefitinib or
erlotinib treatment showed a median PFS of 16.0 months. Mutations of KRAS occurred
in 8 (6.0%, of 134) cases and this was mutually exclusive from EGFR mutation.
Our results demonstrated that ALK FISH and EGFR, KRAS mutational analysis on
cytological specimens are sensitive methods for screening advanced stage NSCLC
patients who are adequate for targeted treatment.

In addition, NSCLC with sensitive epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are well responded to
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and these patients will
have a longer progression-free survival (PFS) than the
patients whose tumors do not contain EGFR mutations
[1, 10].
Approximately 60% of patients with NSCLC are
diagnosed at a late stage for the first time [11]. These
patients are not suitable for the resection of the primary
tumor, and the only pathologic material guiding systemic
therapy should be small biopsy or cytological specimens.
Recent studies have demonstrated that cytological
specimens, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA),
fibreoptic bronchoscopic (FOB) and pleural effusion
(PLE), are suitable for the molecular testing [12–16].
Although FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) is

INTRODUCTION
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which
accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancers, has
been largely identified by oncogenic driver mutations
with potential opportunities for targeted therapies [1, 2].
Recently, activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) gene in lung cancer by fusion to echinoderm
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) or other
gene partners (such as BIRC6 [3], TFG [4], KIF5B [5]
and KLC1 [6]) has been identified as oncogenic events
[7]. Clinical studies have shown that locally advanced
or metastatic NSCLC patients harboring ALK gene
rearrangement are highly sensitive to Crizotinib, which is
a small molecular inhibitor of ALK tyrosine kinase [8, 9].

currently the gold standard method to detect ALK
gene rearrangement approved by FDA, its application
on cytological specimens remains a worth area of
investigation. In this study, we investigate the use of ALK
FISH and EGFR, KRAS mutational testing on cytological
specimens and to evaluate PFS of the patients who
received targeted therapies.

and the other two cases showed complex mutation with
L858R and T790M. Among them, two patients carried
acquired T790M mutation after TKI treatment and one
patient carried primary coexisting mutations of T790M
and L858R. In addition, four patients carried primary exon
20 S768I mutations and did not receive targeted therapies.
The mutated EGFR cases of the cytological samples
were 36 (60.0%, of 60) FNAs, 1 (1.7%, of 60) FOB
and 23 (38.3%, of 60) PLEs (Supplementary Table S2).
The PLE samples showed highest EGFR mutation rate
(58.9%, 23/39) among three groups, although this did
not demonstrate a statistically significant difference
(P = 0.41). Mutations of KRAS occurred in 8 (6.0%, of
134) cases and this was mutually exclusive from EGFR
mutation. In addition, compared with male patients,
female patients were more likely to carry EGFR mutations
(55.6% vs 28.3%, P = 0.002) (Supplementary Table S3).

RESULTS
Specimen and patient characteristics
Demographic and clinicopathologic features were
summarized in Table 1. Of the 137 patients enrolled in
the study, 54 (39.4%, of 137) were male and 83 (60.6%,
of 137) were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 58.8
years (range: 27.0 - 85.0 years) and the median age was
59.0 years. Cytological specimens (n = 137) included
FNAs (n = 91), FOBs (n = 5) and PLEs (n = 41). Of
these, 126 (92.0%, of 137) were diagnosed as ADC, 3
(2.2%, of 137) as SCC, 1 (0.7%) as adenosquamous
carcinoma and 7 (5.1%, of 137) as NSCLC, not otherwise
specified.

Outcomes of targeted therapies
Of the 9 patients who received crizotinib treatment,
there were 5 men and 4 women with mean age of 58.6
years (Table 3). The median follow-up duration was 9
months (range: 6–15 months). At the end of follow up, 8
(88.9%) patients were still receiving crizotinib treatment
and there was one person stopping the treatment because
of disease progression.
We performed targeted next-generation sequencing
(NGS) in one case who did not response well to crizotinib
treatment. Results confirmed the existence of EML4-ALK
transloction, and the relative abundance of EML4-ALK
fusion was 25.3%. In addition, there were a nonsense
mutation (c.991 C > T, p.Q331) in exon 9 of P53 and a
deletion of CDKN2A. The mutation in P53 could result
in a stop codon and lead to loss of P53 function as a
transcription factor. [17]
There were 22 patients with EGFR sensitive
mutations who received gefitinib or erlotinib treatment.
The median PFS was 16.0 months (95% confidence
interval, 12.9 - 19.1) (Figure 2). Of them, 8 patients
(36.4%) exhibited disease progression after 3 months due
to acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. At the data
cutoff point, 14 patients were still taking TKI treatment
and tumor regression was observed in these patients.

ALK FISH analysis
Of the 137 NSCLCs analyzed for ALK FISH,
16 (11.7%, of 137) were detected to harbor ALK
rearrangement (FISH positive) and 121 (88.3%, of 137)
were FISH negative. The ALK FISH positive cases
of the cytological samples were 12 (75.0%, of 16)
FNAs, 1 (6.2%, of 16) FOB and 3 (18.8%, of 16) PLE
(Supplementary Table S1). The FNA samples showed
highest FISH positive rate (13.2%, 12/91) among three
groups, although this did not demonstrate a statistically
significant difference (P = 0.32). On FISH examination
(Figure 1), split pattern was observed in 14 cases (87.5%)
and unbalanced rearrangement, characterized by a loss of
the 5’ probe, was shown in 2 cases (12.5%).
The ALK FISH positive cases included 6 men and
10 women and there was no significant difference in
gender distribution between FISH positive and negative
cases (P = 0.87). The mean age at diagnosis for FISH
positive cases was 52.7 ± 11.8 years, which was much
younger than that of FISH negative cases (P < 0.05).
FISH positive cases were all defined as ADC histologic
subtype. In addition, there was one FISH positive case also
demonstrated an EGFR L858R mutation (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The diagnosis of advanced-stage NSCLC is usually
based on a small amount of cytological specimens,
consequently, the use of ALK FISH and EGFR,
KRAS mutational testing on cytological specimens
is gradually becoming a necessity in the routine
molecular pathological diagnosis. Although FISH is
considered to be the gold standard for detection of ALK
rearrangements on histological tissues approved by FDA,
its application on cytological specimens remains a worth

Among 134 NSCLCs tested, 60 (44.8%, of 134)
cases carried EGFR mutations, which was 53 (39.5%, of
134) sensitive mutations and 4 (3.0%, of 134) exon 20
mutations with S768I. There was one case demonstrated

Targeted therapies are mostly effective in patients
with locally advanced or metastatic disease, thus,
molecular analysis on cytological samples rather than
on resected specimens would be preferred on patients
with late stage tumors. The data in previous studies
demonstrated that the performance of cytology based

EGFR and KRAS mutational analysis was at least as
effective as histology based analysis [18–20]. In this
study, various cytological specimens including FNA, FOB
and PLE were all submitted for EGFR/KRAS mutational
analysis and 97.8% (134/137) of samples were suitable
for test. The other three samples not suitable for analysis
were due to inadequate cell numbers and this prompted us
to use more sensitive methods, such as digital PCR and
NGS, to test EGFR mutations. Recently, a large cohort
of mutational analysis on histological specimens was
performed in 5125 Chinese patients and revealed that
36.2% and 8.4% patients with NSCLC carried EGFR
and KRAS mutations respectively [21]. Cytological
specimens of our study demonstrated slightly higher
EGFR mutational rates (44.8% vs 36.2%) than that of
histological specimens in above study and this could
partly be attributed to the patients undertaken cytological
mutational analysis often underwent a late stage disease.
Previous studies had rarely evaluated the EGFRTKI treatment responses on patients with sensitive EGFR
mutations tested on cytological specimens, although
the outcome of the patients treated with TKI was
important to confirm the predictive value of cytological
mutational analysis. In our study, fifty-seven patients
with EGFR mutations demonstrated an ADC subtype
and this population would largely benefit from targeted
therapies. Twenty-two patients with ADC subtype and

EGFR sensitive mutations received TKI treatment with
a median PFS of 16 months and all the patients were
observed with tumor regression after 3-months treatment.
This was in accordance with previous studies, which
demonstrated that the median PFS interval of 16.2
months was observed in 11 EGFR mutated patients who
treated with gefitinib [22]. In addition, Maria D. Lozano
also observed patients with EGFR mutations had a
12.3-months median PFS [23]. These results indicated
that EGFR mutational testing on cytological samples was
adequate for patient selection with EGFR-TKI treatment.
In addition to guide the targeted therapy for patients
with unresected tumors, another possible advantage of
cytological mutational analysis was to identify genetic
shifts of EGFR acquired mutations during TKI treatment.
It is currently accepted that FISH is the most
appropriate method to detect ALK rearrangements and
to guide crizotinib treatment. Only a few reports have
assessed the adequacy of cytological specimens for
ALK FISH analysis, thus, its application on cytological
specimens still needs further studies. Weiya Wang, et al
analyzed a cohort of 58 patients for ALK rearrangements
using pleural effusion cell blocks and found 10.3%
positive cases by ALK FISH [16]. Agnese Proietti, et al
demonstrated 4.4% cases with ALK FISH rearrangements
in both cell blocks and small biopsies [24]. In addition,
MJ. Neat, et al compared FISH and IHC methods to

(EBUS)-transnronchial needle aspiration (TBNA)
derived cytological specimens and found that FISH was
superior to IHC for the detection of ALK rearrangement
in these cytological samples [25]. To best of our
knowledge, this is the largest report of ALK detection
in cytological specimens in Chinese patients and first
described the outcome of patients with ALK FISH
positive who received crizotinib treatment. In this study,
we detected 11.7% ALK rearrangement in 137 cases of
various cytological specimens, including FNA, FOB and
PLE, which was significantly higher than the rate of 6.8%
previously reported in a large Chinese consecutive case
series [26]. Our results were in accordance with previous
report that 12.7% of ALK rearrangements were observed

in malignant pleural effusion cell blocks from patients
with advanced NSCLC [16]. The increased percentage of
positive cases was likely attributed to the advanced stage
of disease among patients with cytological specimens. Of
the nine patients who received crizotinib treatment, one
patient exhibited disease progression after 5 months and
eight patients were still receiving crizotinib treatment
at the end of cutoff point. We performed targeted nextgeneration sequencing in one case who did not response
well to Crizotinib treatment and found that there was a
nonsense mutation in exon 9 of P53 which could lead to
loss of P53 function. Previous studies have indicated that
P53 alterations might accelerate cancer development and
could also lead to shorter survival in patients with P53
mutated NSCLC [27]. Our findings first demonstrated the

original P53 mutation in ALK positive patients and this
mutation of P53 may correlate to the shorter PFS.
In summary, we conclude thatALK FISH and EGFR,
KRAS mutational analysis on cytological specimens are
sensitive methods for screening advanced stage NSCLC
patients who are adequate for targeted treatment.
Cytological specimens including FNA, FOB and PLE all
provide feasible and effective material for the molecular
analysis and further studies are required to validate
the application in the routine molecular pathological
diagnosis.

using the Vysis LSI ALK Dual color, Break Apart
Rearrangement Probe (Abbott/Vysis, Abbott Park, IL,
USA). Samples were considered to be FISH positive if
more than 15% of the scored tumour cells had split one or
both ALK 5’ and 3’ probe signals or had isolated 3’ signals.
Slides were evaluated independently by two experts blind
to the patient’s history and histological findings.

EGFR and KRAS mutational testing
EGFR and KRAS mutational testing was conducted
as previously described [29]. Briefly, mutational testing
was performed using the HumanEGFR or KRAS Mutation
Qualitative Detection Kit (Beijing ACCB Biotech Ltd.,
China), which applies quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) platform combining amplification refractory
mutation system (ARMS) primers and TaqMan probes.
The sensitive mutations were defined as p.G719S/C/A,
p.L858R, p.L861Q and insertions in exon 19. The hotspot
mutations in KRAS gene were within codon 12 and 13
including p.G12C/V/S/R/D/A and p.G13D. The assay was
carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
the Stratagene Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Agilent
technologies Inc, USA). Presence or absence of mutations
was assessed from the fluorescence amplification curve.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
One hundred and thirty-seven patients with advanced
NSCLC were enrolled in this study from September 2013
to June 2015. All these cytological samples, including FNA,
FPB and PLE, were tested for ALK fusion by FISH and
134 were performed with EGFR and KRAS mutational
testing because 3 samples were not adequate for DNA
extraction. Imaging data were independently reviewed by
authors to evaluate their treatment responses according
to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1. PFS was calculated from the date
of initiating TKI treatment to a radiologic or clinical
observation of disease progression. The study protocol
was approved by the Institute Review Board of the Cancer
Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS),
Beijing, China. The methods were carried out in accordance
with the approved guidelines. Each participant signed an
Institutional Review Board approved informed consent in
accordance with current guidelines.

Targeted next-generation sequencing

The cytological specimen preparations were
conducted according to a standard specimen processing
protocol in our laboratory. The cases included FNA
specimens obtained under image guidance with a
cytopathologist present for adequacy assessment and
pleural fluid specimens obtained by thoracentesis. The
percentage of tumor cells more than 5% or over 500 tumor
cells were used for DNA extraction and 100 tumor cells
for ALK FISH analysis. The algorithm used for molecular
testing in our study was depicted in Supplementary
Figure S1. Each case had air-dried slides stained with
Diff-Quik (DQ stain, Protocol Hema 3; Fisher Scientific,
Kalamazoo, MI) and additional slides fixed in 95% alcohol
for Papanicolaou staining. Fluid specimens also had a
ThinPrep (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) slide prepared.

For one patient who did not response well to
crizotinib treatment, targeted next-generation sequencing
was performed. Genomic DNA was profiled by using a
capture-based targeted sequencing panel (Burning Rock
Biotech, Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China). In
brief, human genomic regions of 271 kb, including all
exons in 56 genes and selected introns in ALK, RET and
ROS1 for the detection of translocation events, were
captured by using 120-bp probes and were sequenced
(Supplementary Table S4). The concentration of the DNA
samples was measured with the Qubit dsDNA assay.
Fragments of 200 to 400-bp sizes were selected with
beads (Agencourt AMPure XP kit; Beckman-Coulter,
Brea, CA), followed by hybridization with the capture
probes baits, hybrid selection with magnetic beads, and
PCR amplification. A bioanalyzer high-sensitivity DNA
assay was then used to assess the quality and size range.
Available indexed samples were then sequenced on a
Nextseq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with pair-end reads.
Sequence data were analyzed by GATK 3.2 (https://www.
broadinstitute.org/gatk/) and DNA translocation analysis
was performed by using both Tophat2 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/
software/tophat/index.shtml) and Factera 1.4.3 ((http://
factera.stanford.edu) [30].
