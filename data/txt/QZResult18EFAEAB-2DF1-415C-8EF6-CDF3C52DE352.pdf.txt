ABSTRACT
In addition to genetic mutations, epigenetic revision plays a major role in the
development and progression of cancer; specifically, inappropriate DNA methylation
or demethylation of CpG residues may alter the expression of genes that promote
tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that DNA repair, specifically the repair of DNA double
strand breaks (DSB) by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) may play a role in this
process. Using a GFP reporter system inserted into the genome of HeLa cells, we
are able to induce targeted DNA damage that enables the cells, after successfully
undergoing NHEJ repair, to express WT GFP. These GFP+ cells were segregated into
two expression classes, one with robust expression (Bright) and the other with reduced
expression (Dim). Using a DNA hypomethylating drug (AzadC) we demonstrated that
the different GFP expression levels was due to differential methylation statuses of
CpGs in regions on either side of the break site. Deep sequencing analysis of this area
in sorted Bright and Dim populations revealed a collection of different epi-alleles that
display patterns of DNA methylation following repair by NHEJ. These patterns differ
between Bright and Dim cells which are hypo- and hypermethylated, respectively, and
between the post-repair populations and the original, uncut cells. These data suggest
that NHEJ repair facilitates a rewrite of the methylation landscape in repaired genes,
elucidating a potential source for the altered methylation patterns seen in cancer cells,
and understanding the mechanism by which this occurs could provide new therapeutic
targets for preventing this process from contributing to tumorigenesis.

[2, 3], environment [4], disease [5–8], or other external
or intrinsic events [9]. In this work, we are examining
somatic, metastable DNA methylation. This epigenetic
modification is usually associated with gene silencing
[10, 11] as it interferes with transcription machinery and
is recognized by proteins that recruit histone modifiers
to condense chromatin, an action which blocks the
accessibility of transcription machinery to the affected

DNA may be methylated on cytosine residues
of CpG islands by the catalytic activity of DNA
methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation may
be classified as either invariant and stable (sex-specific
imprinting) or metastable. In somatic cells, DNA
methylation is metastable and changes with age [1], diet

genes [12–14]. Under normal conditions, epigenetic
modifications serve to modulate gene expression during
embryonic development [15] and genomic imprinting
[16], differentiation [17], or in response to stimuli [18];
however unscheduled changes can cause inappropriate
gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes or activation of
oncogenes, a phenomenon that is seen in various types of
cancer cells [10, 19–21].
In order to pass the G2 checkpoint and enter mitosis,
cells must repair any DNA damages that have occurred.
Double stranded breaks in DNA (DSBs), in which breaks
occur in both strands of the DNA double helix in close
proximity to one another, are the most dangerous damage
for a cell [22, 23]. These breaks can be caused by both
exogenous and endogenous sources including reactive
oxygen species, ionizing radiation [24], replication fork
collapse [22, 25], or the faulty action of nuclear enzymes
such as topoisomerase II [26, 27]. Regardless of origin,
DSBs are fatal to the cell if not repaired. When faced with
such a damage, the cell must repair the damage in order to
survive or continue dividing [22]. Double strand breaks are
repaired by one of two pathways in Eukaryotic cells [28].
During S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when DNA has
been replicated and exists in pairs of sister chromatids, the
cell is able to fix the breaks with the high fidelity process of
Homology Dependent Repair (HDR) [29, 30]. This process
involves resection of one strand of a broken end to produce
a single stranded overhang that can invade the helix of the
sister chromatid. Polymerase then uses the sister chromatid
to fill in sequence on the broken ends and the strands are
resolved to separate, complete sister chromatids [26, 31].
During the rest of the cell cycle, or in non-dividing cells,
no identical sequence template is available to allow HDR
to proceed, so the cell turns to the faster but more error
prone process of Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)
[32, 33]. This process proceeds through recognition and
binding of the broken ends by Ku 70-80 proteins and
DNA-PKcs [34]. Together, this complex has a role similar
to that of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)
during replication as it acts as a docking platform for other
proteins. During repair, these other proteins are nuclease,
polymerase, and ligase complexes needed to process
the repair. The DNA-PKcs complex with Artemis has 3’
and 5’ endonuclease as well as 5’ exonuclease activity,
allowing it to process a diverse array of damaged DNA
ends. Polymerases μ and λ are also able to interact with
the complex, allowing flexible and template-independent
synthesis. The processing of DNA ends during NHEJ is
not fully understood and is not the same for each break;
even identical breaks in the same location show variation in
end processing [34]. Blunted DNA ends are subsequently
ligated through the action of XLF:XRCC4:DNA ligase
IV complex. Although the immediate threat to the cell is
averted by repair of the DSB, repair by NHEJ often results
in deletions or frame shifts in the repaired area as a result
of end processing. This process is a major source of DNA
mutation in arrested cells [35]. Despite its limitations, the

quick kinetics and ability to repair without a template make
NHEJ the repair pathway of choice in cells outside of S and
G2 and in non-dividing cells. It is the predominant DSB
repair pathway in animal cells since it occurs throughout
the cell cycle [32, 33].
Studies of HDR have determined that, following
repair, some cells exhibit robust expression of the repaired
gene while others show low expression levels. It was
determined that these expression classes arise as a result of
epigenetic reprogramming, more specifically, altered CpG
methylation at the repair site [36–38]. In addition, specific
DNA methyltransferases have been found to localize at
DNA repair sites [36]. During S phase, DNMT1 methylates
hemimethylated DNA during replication, copying the
methylation profile of the parental DNA strand to the
daughter strand, a process which is also ongoing when
DNA methylation is altered post-HDR [36, 39]. Thus,
DNA methylation exists in a triad of dynamic, interworking
processes along with DNA replication and HDR.
The mechanism for DNMT-mediated methylation at
repair sites following NHEJ, which occurs independently
of DNA replication, is less well understood despite being
a prominent DNA repair pathway in animal cells. We
address this topic in the current paper. Specifically, in this
work, we report the following observations. First, NHEJ
repair pathway attended by DNA methylation revision
in somatic human cells. Second, specific methylation
sites map on the repaired gene to sites that are distinctly
different from those seen in the HDR pathway [36]. Third,
we show that epigenetic revisions driven by NHEJ are
stably inherited. In this work, we used a neutral gene
to report alterations in DNA methylation to ensure that
selective pressure post repair would not influence our
ability to track the NHEJ descendants. Collectively, the
data supports the notion that the prominent DNA repair
pathway in animal cells is a source of genetic diversity but
also a source of epigenetic (or gene expression) change in
cases where a wild type allele is recovered post-NHEJ.

RESULTS
A neutral reporter system for analysis of
epigenetic revision during NHEJ
In order to study the NHEJ repair pathway, we
have generated a HeLa cell line containing a GFP based
reporter construct [40, 41] (Figure 1A). The construct
contains a CMV driven GFP gene that was interrupted by
a rodent Pem1 intron. Within this intron, an adenoviral
exon was added that is flanked by two restriction sites for
the megaendonuclease, I-Sce1. There are no I-Sce1 sites
in the human genome; Thus DSB are target to these twin
sites. The presence of the viral exon disrupts the gene, and
as a consequence, the cells are GFP negative; however
when I-SceI is introduced to the cells, the adenoviral exon
is excised by two DSBs and repaired by NHEJ. Since
removal of the exon allows the construct to generate

WT GFP after splicing, cells have effectively undergone
NHEJ repair and some sub-fraction of the cells will be
GFP positive (since NHEJ is error prone, we cannot score
mutant alleles with this assay based on GFP expression).
In addition, there is no homologous DNA template for the
repair event; therefore, this is a dedicated NHEJ repair
process and HDR cannot proceed under these conditions.
To improve accuracy and penetrance of the system, the
gene for I-SceI gene has been placed in these HeLa cells

under control of a Tet-On promoter, thus, the system is
doxycycline inducible.

A segregation of expression classes following
repair by NHEJ
The NHEJ reporter system was tested by adding
Doxycycline (Dox) to the media of the IHN20.22 HeLa
cells. We note that other clones tested behaved similarly;

Figure 1: Doxycycline inducible construct uses GFP as a reporter for NHEJ. (A) Reporter construct integrated into the

genome of the IHN20.22 HeLa cell line. The NHEJ reporter GFP gene contains a Pem1 intron interrupted by an adenoviral exon. Two
I-Sce1 restriction sites allow the homing endonuclease to cut the DNA and excise the adenoviral exon to produce wild-type GFP following
repair by NHEJ. (B) Generation of GFP positive cells following repair. Cells were induced with dox for 24 hours and then the percentage
of the population expressing GFP was analyzed using FACS. The circles on the “+Dox” plot indicate two separate GFP positive cell
populations with differing expression levels of GFP (C) Time course analysis. The percentage of GFP positive cells was analyzed by FACS
over the course of 9 days, either following a 24-hour induction or with continuous exposure to doxycycline. The uncut cell line with no
dox exposure was also analyzed to asses basal levels of GFP expression. (D) The onset of WT GFP expression in a single cell during the 72

however some clones displayed higher backgrounds,
probably due to leaky I-Sce1 expression in the absence of
Dox. IHN20.22 was selected since this clone exhibited low
levels of GFP positive cells in the absence of Dox. I-Sce1
induction was quite robust in IHN20.22 cells and within
a few hours after Dox addition, Western blots showed the
presence of prominent amounts of I-Sce1 protein (data not
shown). At 24 hours post-Dox, GFP expressing cells could
readily be seen by live imaging or fluorescent microscopy.
GFP levels could also be measured using flow cytometry
(Figure 1B). The percentage of GFP positive cells
steadily increases over time with continuous exposure
to Doxycycline, while in negative controls (no Dox) the
percentage of GFP positive cells stays well under 1%
which we attribute to leakiness of the Tet-On promoter,
as noted. After a 24 hour pulse with Dox, the percentage
increases and then peaks at about 5-7% after four days
(Figure 1C). The emergence of GFP positive cells can be
observed via live imaging during the 72 hours following
induction with Doxycycline (Figure 1D) as a GFP negative
cell (circle, top image) undergoes NHEJ repair and begins
to express WT GFP as time progresses to the second
image. Since the post-repair cell now contains a WT GFP
gene, division produces two GFP positive daughter cells
in the last image. By limiting the expression of I-Sce1
to 24 hours, the pulse-chase experimental schematic
allows for focused investigation of the processes that
occur following a DSB without the added variables of
continuous DSB induction and continuous Dox treatment.
Note that the scatter plots in Figure 1C appear to contain
dual populations of GFP positive cells (dashed rings).
The two populations, which appear to differ in total GFP
expression levels were more clearly observable after Dox
induction with I-Sce1; however in the negative controls,
this heterogeneity was observed. This was examined in
more detail in order to understand the underlying basis for
this observation.

known mechanism, multiple cell divisions are required in
order to observe genome-wide hypomethylation, which is
manifested in the daughter cell population.
When IHN20.22 cells are induced with Dox and
then treated with AzadC, there is an obvious shift of
cells from the low expressing Dim population to the high
expressing Bright population (Figure 2B). The conversion
of ‘dim’ cells to ‘bright’ cells by the hypomethylating drug
suggests that the repaired GFP gene in the low expressing
pool is a direct result of DNA methylation either during
or soon after NHEJ repair. In the absence of AzadC, the
Bright population of cells initially decreases over 4 days
then appears to stabilize (Figure 2C, -AzadC). In contrast,
cells treated with AzadC displayed a clearly different
trend (Figure 2C, -AzadC). The drug reverses the loss in
Bright cells, probably due to the ongoing conversion of
Dim cells into the Bright pool. In either case, a few days
after the damage/repair event, the proportions of cells
in Bright and Dim cell populations remain fairly stable
as cells are passaged (Figure 2C); however, addition of
AzadC to cells that are 24 days post-repair results in a
sharp increase in the percentage of high expressing cells
(Figure 2D), supporting the notion that the expression
difference is likely due to post-repair methylation as
opposed to an off target drug interaction during the repair
process. Further, the extent to which AzadC causes the
shift from low to high GFP expression occurs is dose
dependent (Figure 2E).
Since it appears that the expression classes
eventually become stable, presumably due to stable
methylation marks (which are heritable) we next attempted
to isolate pure populations of Dim and Bright cells to
make the analysis more tractable. Before treatment, sorted
Dim cells appear as a relatively homogenous population
in a uni-modal distribution (Figure 3A) with relatively
low levels of GFP expression (labeled as the “P1” pool).
Note that while the distribution is broad, it is nonetheless
uniform with very low levels of bright GFP expressing
cells (P4). Following AzadC treatment of the Dim cell
pool, a new population emerges in the high expression
range (Figure 3A right panel “P4” pool). As with sorted
Dim cells, sorted Bright cells also show a single peak of
GFP expression (Figure 3B); however these cells are far
more homogeneous (compare 3A, B). Since the Bright
cell pool also shifts perceptibly to the right in the presence
of AzadC (Figure 3B, right panel, P4), we conclude that
the bright pool contains cells with some degree of DNA
methylation (which is removed by AzadC) (Figure 3B).
This experiment clearly evidenced the conversion of Dim
cells to Bright cells by a DNA hypomethylating drug.
Live imaging reveals that the information regulating the
GFP expression level of post-repair cells is passed from
parent to daughter cells as the cells divide (Figure 3C,
Supplementary Movie 1). The cause of the silencing
is heritable but reversible, pointing once more to DNA
methylation as the source of the gene expression variation.

GFP Expression is heterogeneous in repaired cell
populations following NHEJ
The histogram of GFP positive cells reveals the
emergence of two expression classes with differing GFP
intensities. One class expresses GFP robustly while
the other maintains lower expression levels. We refer
to these populations as Bright and Dim, respectively
(Figure 2A). To determine if the differing expression
classes may be a result of DNA methylation, we tested
whether the expression classes were altered by the DNA
hypomethylating drug, 5’-Aza-2’-Deoxycytidine (AzadC).
This drug acts by inducing a stable, covalent complex
between the methyl's and DNA [36, 42–44]. The result is
hypomethylation of the genome due to the sequestering of
DNMTs that are covalently bound to DNA. This prevents
further methyltransferase action and effectively inhibits
the overall DNA methylation of the cell. Based on this

The availability of relatively pure populations of
Dim and Bright cells makes it possible to use bisulfite
DNA sequencing to interrogate methylation sites before
and after NHEJ. Thus, in addition to validating the
presence of epi-alleles in Dims and Brights, bisulfite
DNA sequencing of the post-repair populations makes
it possible to map these epi-alleles relative to the I-Sce1
cleavage and repair site. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed
that the GFP gene is hypomethylated in sorted Bright cells
and hypermethylated in sorted Dim cells. Specifically,
changes occur in regions both up and downstream of the
break site (Figure 4). Interestingly, the methylation status
of CpGs in the region directly flanking the break site is
not affected by the process. This suggests a coordination
of methylation and repair proteins to affect methylation
patterns in specific areas around the site of DNA damage.

molecules; however it does not consider the relationship
between the different methylated cytosines present on
the same molecule (epialleles). For this reason, we have
analyzed the composition of methylated population
(heterogeneity), by counting the number of different
epialleles in the sample (haplotypes) obtained from deep
sequencing analysis of the amplicons.
The DSB region was divided into 5 segments (3
upstream and 2 downstream regions from the DSB site,
see top diagram in Figure 5). Deep quantitative (Taxa,
PCoA and Shannon Index) and qualitative (methylation
profiles) analysis of amplicons with the same end was
carried out. The results show that recombinant cells (both
Dims and Brights) and uncut parental cells have the
same types of methylated species (un-methylated, mono,
bi and tri-methylated) but with different compositions
(Figure 5A, Supplementary Table 1). In fact, the Bright
cells appear to be rich in unmethylated species compared
to Dims and Uncut in each region, confirming that high
levels of GFP expression in this population are largely
unmethylated (marked by an asterisk in Figure 5A).
Moreover, Principal Coordinates Analysis reveals that
Dim and Uncut parental DNAs have a smaller euclidean
distance compared to Bright (variation 96% vs 4%),
highlighting a common origin for Recombinant (ie, NHEJ
repaired) cells, followed by a de-methylation event of the
Bright cells (Figure 5B). We also analyzed the diversity
index (Shannon Index) in order to evaluate the evenness

Different DNA methylation patterns mark
RECOMBINANT from UNCUT cells
The data so far demonstrate that NHEJ is spinning
out new epi-alleles that are either over-written or
completely revised from the parental (uncut) reporter
DNA. Moreover, the expressability of the repair products
correlates with the percent of DNA methylation in sorted
Dim and Bright cells. The pyrosequencing analysis
done thus far evaluates the average methylation levels
for a single CpG site derived from physically different

of the species. Except for the region 1 (where Bright and
Uncut are much more similar to the Dims), we observe
that 2 upstream regions of DSB site (Region 2 - 3) show
a gradual increase in similarity between Dims and Uncut
relative to the Bright cells (single asterisk*), while region
4 (downstream region of DSB site) shows a high similarity
between the Recombinants (Dims plus Brights) compared
to the Uncut (double asterisk **), which is lost in the
region 5 (Figure 6A).
Finally, we have performed a deep qualitative
analysis to identify the differences between Recombinant
and Uncut (parental) cells in terms of gain or loss of
methylation. The differences between the percentage of
Recombinant’s epialleles compared to Uncut cells show
that the Dim cells gain methylation marks in the region
1 (di-methylated epialleles), in the region 2 (mono-, diand tri-methylated epialleles), and in the region 5 (mono-,
di- and tri-methylated epialleles). In contrast the Bright
cells lose methylated epialleles in these same regions. For
example, in region 3, Bright cells appear to acquire new
methylation (di-methylated epialleles) while DIMS lose
methylation. Both Dims and Bright cells lose methylation
(tri-, di-methylated epialleles) acquiring mono-methylated
epialleles in the region 4. Knowing the different GFP
expression between the two populations, we hypothesize
that transcription may modify DNA methylation (or

de-methylation) after DNA damage and NHEJ repair,
remodeling the chromatin in units with different
transcriptional efficiency (and in the process spinning out
Dim and Bright cell populations) [38].

DISCUSSION
Epigenetic revision as a component of
tumorigenesis
This study reveals a novel connection between two
essential cellular processes that has a potential role in the
development and progression of cancer. Cancerous cells
arise in a multi-step process as a result of an upset in the
balance of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that
causes deregulation of normal epistasis. This imbalance
may derive from genetic mutations that affect this balance;
however changes in expression levels can also be caused
by inappropriate DNA methylation marks. Moreover, the
addition or removal of post-translational modifications
to histones can affect the access of transcriptional
machinery to particular genes by opening or closing
the chromatin, causing gene activation or repression,
respectively [11, 19, 45, 46]. Both hypermethylation and
hypomethylation can contribute to tumorigenesis when
they occur at inappropriate positions in the genome. DNA

hypermethylation is generally associated with gene silencing
while hypomethylated is associated with gene activation
[19, 20]. Changes in the cellular DNA methylome resulting
in hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes including
APC, BRCA1, E-cadherins, DAPK1, hMLH1, p15, Rb,
MGMT, and p16INK4a have been documented in tumors
from a variety of cancers including breast, colon, gastric,
ovarian, lung, brain, ovarian, renal, kidney, prostate,
thyroid, lymphoma, and leukemia [11, 19, 20]. In addition
to silencing tumor suppressor genes, hypermethylation
can cause down regulation of miRNAs, some of which
have tumor suppressing activity [47–49]. For example,
miR124a is frequently down regulated in several cancer
types including colon, breast, and lung carcinomas as well
as some leukemias and lymphomas. Because this miRNA is
a negative regulator of CDK6, down regulation caused by
hypermethylation results in increased levels of CDK6 which
in turn facilitates inactivation of RB1 via phosphorylation
[50] Since miRNAs have also been shown to regulate
epigenetic processes through interaction with DNMTs
and EZH2 complexes [51, 52], downregulation could
potentially propagate DNA methylation changes in other
areas of the genome. Hypomethylation has also been shown
to contribute to tumorigenesis by over-activating oncogenes
and contributing to genetic instability and structural changes
by promoting an open chromatin state [20, 53].
Cancer cells coordinate genetic mutations and
epigenetic revision in order to promote carcinogenesis.

According to the two-hit hypothesis, a tumor suppressor
gene must be deactivated in both alleles in order to cause
cancer. HCT116 colon cancer cells were found to have
genetic mutations in one allele of both CDKN2a and
MLH1 and epigenetic silencing of the second allele,
demonstrating the collaboration of genetic mutation and
hypermethylation in achieving the second ‘hit’ to cause
loss of heterozygosity and inactivation a tumor suppressor
gene [20]. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation
can also contribute to cancer progression by promoting
mutagenic processes. This is observed in the silencing
of genes involved in DNA repair via hypermethylation,
which results in defective repair pathways and increased
DNA mutagenesis [45, 54]. In addition, hypomethylation
can cause over expression of an oncogene due to the
loss of genomic imprinting that results in the expression
of both alleles instead of only one allele [55, 56], and
hypomethylation of LINE retrotransposons facilitates
insertion mutagenesis [57, 58].
Despite their involvement in so many types of
cancer, the root cause of DNA miscues is largely unknown.
Deep sequencing analysis of post-repair DNA revealed
both loss and of methylation in areas up and downstream
of the break site (Figure 6B) that is correlated with up- or
downregulation, respectively. The mechanism described
here provides evidence for alterations in methylation
profiles as a result of NHEJ repair, a process which could
explain the epigenetic revision that is characteristic of

cancer cells. What is not clear is how universal and widespread NHEJ-mediated epigenetic revision paths are in a
tissue context. In our model system, we used a gene that
is not subject to selection; however it stands to reason
that silencing or activating a positive or negative growthpromoting gene could produce cells that have a growth
advantage relative to surrounding normal cells [11, 20,
59]. Growth promoting outcomes could clearly place
the cell on a path toward a pre-cancerous condition. In
contrast, silencing a pro-growth gene (oncogene) could
result in the loss of a cell lineage. In either situation, tissue
epistasis could be targeted with undesirable outcomes.
What is intriguing is that even when an error-prone
pathway such as NHEJ regenerates wild-type sequence,
there is still a good chance for gene activation or silencing.
Thus, mutating a tumor suppressor gene is functionally
equivalent to epigenetic silencing the expression of the
same gene, with the same dire consequences.

specific therapeutics [56]. Further, although methylation
aberrations tend to accumulate with malignant
progression, they have also been shown to be present in
the early stages of pre-malignancy [20, 62, 64]. This could
make them candidates for use as a diagnostic tool for early
detection of cancer cells [62, 64]. Further, exposing the
mechanism behind the overlap of these key processes
could provide new targets for therapeutics to interfere
with the progressive gain of epigenetic miscues by this
mechanism and prevent tumor progression.

Intragenic DNA methylation and gene silencing
While methylation based gene silencing is typically
associated with promotor CpG islands, studies have
also shown that intragenic methylation may affect gene
expression as well. Intragenic methylation in plant cells
was shown to increase in more highly transcribed genes,
presumably in an effort to prevent aberrant transcription
at other nearby sites that can result when transcription
machinery disrupts chromatin structure. Inhibition of DNA
methylation in these cells caused up regulation of genes
that were methylated only in the body of the gene and
not in their promoters [65]. Similar results were found in
mammalian cells where intragenic methylation was shown
to decrease gene expression and facilitate compaction of
chromatin that is correlated with a reduced density of
DNA polymerase II in the body of the gene. Further,
another study concluded that a single methylated CpG in
the intron of the PMP24 gene was sufficient to silence the
gene. In addition to demonstrating the ability of intragenic
methylation to silence genes, these studies suggests a
connection between methylation and reduced elongation
efficiency. This supports our findings that aberrant
methylation in the body of the GFP gene causes silencing.
This also incites the idea that transcription may
reshape the epigenetic landscape, a phenomenon that has
already been demonstrated to occur following DNA repair
by HDR [37]. It was found that this process is mediated
by Base Excision Repair (BER)-mediated demethylation
[38]. Principle Coordinates Analysis presented in Figure
5B revealed that Dim cells had a closer Euclidian distance
to the original, uncut parental DNA than Bright cells. This
data supports a model where the area surrounding the
site of NHEJ is first methylated and then progressively
demethylated over time with transcription, resulting in an
array of epialleles with differing levels and locations of
methylated CpGs. Future work will look further into this
idea.
In summary, this study reveals a novel connection
between two processes that have important roles in
cancer development and progression, NHEJ and DNA
methylation. This link provides a clue to one of the biggest
unanswered question in this area of study: What causes
the epigenetic revision that is pivotal to the multistep
progression of cancer? While DNA damage and repair
is stochastic, a damage event that results in epigenetic

A new pathway for discovery of novel epitherapeutic targets
Changes in DNA methylation have been shown to
accumulate throughout the genome with the progression of
cancer [59–62] and have been shown to positively correlate
with tumor stage [61]. Cancer cells have also been shown
to acquire additional genetic mutations due to an increase
in DSBs resulting from increase reactive oxygen species
production, telomeric dysfunction, genomic instability,
and replication errors [33, 63]. Although the increased
DSB may give cancer cells a growth advantage by
providing favorable mutations in key regulatory genes, it
also makes them increasingly dependent on DSB repair
in order to grow and proliferate at a high rate. If DNA
methylation revisions occur during or soon after NHEJ,
as demonstrated here, further DSB repair that occurs in
rapidly dividing cancer cells may exacerbate the situation
and could explain the accumulation of inappropriately
methylated or demethylated genes that is characteristic of
progressing cancer.
One important property of epigenetic alterations
that makes them an idea therapeutic target is that they are
reversible. This is in contrast to genetic mutations that are
embedded in the DNA sequence. In fact, hypomethylating
drugs including 5’Aza-2’-deoxycitidine (Decitabine), and
1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (Zebularine),
have been shown to have positive effects when used to
treated cancer cells. The FDA has approved the use of
Decitabine for treating myelodysplastic syndrome and
Zebularine for treating hematological malignancies
[19, 46, 56, 62]. Studies have also shown that antisense
and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DNA
methyltransferase mRNA can inhibit growth of colon
and renal cell carcinoma cells [46, 56]. The association
of methylation revisions with tumor stage could enable
their use as a cancer marker to predict prognosis of
developing cancer and to predict responsiveness to

revision following repair and provides the cell with
a growth advantage could direct the cell onto a path of
tumorigenesis. This could explain why some genes exhibit
inappropriate methylation patterns in some cancers but not
others, as only genes that are beneficial to that particular
tissue type would confer a selective advantage. Thus,
methylation revision following DNA repair by NHEJ,
the most predominant repair pathway in animal cells, fits
the criterion to be the source of epigenetic abnormalities
in cancer cells and could provide information for
the development of new therapeutic strategies for
preventing and stopping this process from contributing to
tumorigenesis.

and then placed into an incubation chamber that is part of
a Perkin Elmer UltraVIEW VoX 3D Live Cell Imaging
System attached to a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted
fluorescence microscope. Images were taken every 5
minutes for the next 48 hours and then analyzed using
Volocity Imaging and Analysis software (Perkin Elmer).

Drug treatments
IHN20.22 cells were plated at low confluence and
induced with doxycycline for 24 hours. After 24 hours,
media was removed and replaced with fresh media and
cells were given a daily dose of 1μM 5-AzadC or 1%
DMSO control for 48 hours (unless otherwise noted) and
then were harvested for FACS analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Cell sorting

The stable HeLa cell line was cultured in RPMI
medium with L-glutamine and supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells
were grown in at 37°C at 5% CO2.

Dox induced IHN 20.22 cells were treated with
dox for 24 hours and then grown under normal culture
conditions until the GFP expression levels stabilized.
Cells were then harvested and resuspended in median
containing RPMI, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 20mM
Hepes buffer, and 2% FBS at a density of 3x106 cells/
mL. Cells were run through FACSAria flowcytometer and
sorted by using the FSC-A and FITC-A plot to gate GFP
positive cells and then using the histogram of FITC-A
to select ‘dim’ and ‘bright’ populations. Two sorted
populations (Bright and Dim) were collected in a tube
containing media supplemented with 30% FBS and then
transferred to culture dishes containing culture medium
(RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillinstreptomycin) at 37°C at 5% CO2.

Stable cell line
HeLa cells were transfected with a Tet-On inducible
gene expression system (Clontech) and set to target the
I-Sce1 gene according to the Tet-On system manual. After
generation of a stable Tet-On cell line, the cells were
transfected with the GFP reporter construct for NHEJ
provided by the Gorbunova lab [40]. These cells were
grown under selective pressure with Geneticin (G418)
to generate the stable iHN20.22 cell line containing the
reporter construct and a tetracycline inducible I-Sce1 gene.

Bisulfite converted DNA preparation

Tet on promoter activation

Genomic DNA was extracted from iHN20.22
cells (uncut) as well as the sorted bright and dim
populations using Wizard genomic DNA purification
kit” (Promega). 100ng of extracted DNA was used for
bisulfite conversion using the Epijet Bisulfite Conversion
Kit (Thermoscientific). Regions on either side of the repair
site in bisulfite converted DNA were amplified using
Phusion U Hot Start Polymerase (Thermoscientific) and

iHN20.22 cells were treated with 1μg/mL
doxycycline for varying durations to determine the optimal
induction time. It was determined that a 24 hour pulse of
doxycycline was sufficient to induce the NHEJ system, so
this was used in future experiments.

FACS analysis
IHN20.22 cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at
1000xg for 5 minutes and then and resuspended in PBS at
a density of 106 cells/mL. Live cells were selected using
a plot of SSC-A vs. FSC-A, and GFP positive cells were
identified using a plot of FSC-A vs FL1A-A. The FL1-A
histogram was then used to identify and gate the distinct
populations of low and high expressing cells.

Live cell imaging
Cells were seeded at low density in glass bottom
culture dishes (MatTek) induced with Dox for 24 hours

Bisulfite sequencing
These samples were transferred to the core sequencing
facility at Sanford Burnham at Lake Nona, Orlando Florida.
Illumina’s Truseq ChIP Library Preparation kit was used
to prepare a total of 15 libraries (5 fragments each for 3
samples: uncut, sorted Dim, and sorted Bright) from
10ng of input DNA. Quality and quantity of the libraries
were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and Kapa
Biosystems qPCR. The Multiplexed libraries were pooled
and subjected to Paired-end 2x250-bp sequencing using one
flow-cell of a Miseq sequencing instrument.

Methylation analysis
FastQ files were subjected to quality check using
FASTQC software ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.
ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Then, paired-end reads from the
sequencer platform were merged together using PEAR
tool [66] with a minimum of 40 overlapping residues as
threshold (mean PHREAD score of at least 33) and merged
FastQ files were converted in Fasta using Prinseq. [67] To
analyze the methylation status of each amplicon, we used
AMPLIMETHPROFILER [68] specifically designed for
deep targeted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of multiple
genomic regions. This pipeline is freely available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/amplimethprofiler and is
organized as follows: first, it recognizes corresponding
target region discarding PCR artifacts and reads that do
not match expected lengths; then, reads are aligned to the
corresponding bisulfite-converted reference using BLASTn
[69]. We used very stringent parameters: fragment
length threshold, 50%; threshold alignment primers,
80%; bisulfite conversion efficiency, 99% and threshold
alignment to reference, 50%. The pipeline output format
reports the methylation status for each CpG dinucleotide
coded 0 as non-methylated, 1 as methylated, and 2 if the
methylation state cannot be assessed. We use this output to
perform the analysis. Quantitative methylation average for
each site is represented by the ratio between the number
of non-converted bases at that site and the total number
of mapped reads. The abundance of each of the 2NCpG
distinct epialleles (where NCpG stands for the number of
CpG sites in the analyzed region) was evaluated for each
sample by counting the number of passing filter reads
containing that epiallele. Qualitative methylation analysis
was performed using Qiime [70], which includes: 1. a
“summary”, the number of profiles present in each input
sample; 2. a “taxa_summary_plots”, the information on
the distribution of methylation profile classes; 3. “alpha
diversity”, the five alpha diversity metrics for each sample:
a. number of different methylation profiles in the sample;
b. shannon entropy; c. simpson index; d. Chao 1 index ;
e. number of singletons. Such metrics were computed
