ABSTRACT
In women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), introduction of the antiHER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) directed therapies including
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and/or trastuzumab-DM1 has markedly improved
overall survival. However, not all cases of HER2-positive breast tumours derive similar
benefit from HER2-directed therapy, and a significant number of patients experience
disease progression because of primary or acquired resistance to anti-HER2-directed
therapies. We integrated genomic and clinicopathological analyses in a cohort of
patients with refractory breast cancer to anti-HER2 therapies to identify the molecular
basis for clinical heterogeneity. To study the molecular basis underlying refractory
MBC, we obtained 36 MBC tumours tissues and used next-generation sequencing to
investigate the mutational and transcriptional profiles of 83 genes. We focused on
HER2 mutational sites and HER2 pathways to identify the roles of HER2 mutations
and the HER2 pathway in the refractoriness to anti-HER2 therapies. Analysis using
massively parallel sequencing platform, CancerSCAN™, revealed that HER2 mutations
were found in six of 36 patients (16.7%). One patient was ER (estrogen receptor)positive and HER2-negative and the other five HER2 mutated patients were HER2positive and HR (hormone receptor)-negative. Most importantly, four of these five
patients did not show any durable clinical response to HER2-directed therapies.
The HER2 pathway score obtained through transcriptional analyses identified that
Growth Receptor Biding protein 2 (GRB2) was the most significantly down regulated
gene in the HER2 mutated samples. Detection of HER2 mutations using higher deep
DNA sequencing may identify a predictive biomarker of resistance to HER2-directed
therapy. Functional validation is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to evaluate
the HER pathway in patients with refractory MBC.

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable
disease with a 2- to 3-year median overall survival
(OS) time [1, 2]. Although marked advances have been
made in HER2-targeted therapies [3–6] and strategies
to overcome endocrine resistance [7, 8], some patients
exhibit refractory MBC, which do not respond to
conventional treatments, and are therefore in need
of new therapeutic strategies. When developing such
strategies, it is important to realize that patients with
MBC are a heterogeneous group, and thus the best
strategies for treatment may differ between patients.
The results of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
approaches in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggest
that primary BCs are mutationally heterogeneous [9,
10]. This heterogeneity of MBCs and refractoriness to
conventional treatments represent a significant treatment
challenge, and there is a pressing need to understand better
the biology of these aggressive cancers and to develop
more effective therapies. Progress in cancer genomics
has raised hopes of more precise identification of patients
suitable for targeted therapies tailored to their genotype.
However, there remains a feasibility issue before NGS
can be used in making decisions about clinical treatment
in daily clinical practice, especially for patients with
refractory disease who have only limited options for
cancer treatments.
The HER pathway plays a critical role in the
pathogenesis of breast cancer, especially in patients
with HER2 overexpression [11]. HER-2, together with
HER-1, HER-3, and HER-4, is member of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor family. HER-1,
HER-3, and HER-4 can be activated by various
ligands, and their activation triggers conformational
rearrangement of the receptor molecules to allow homoor heterodimerization [12]. Although wild-type HER2
overexpression occurs in 20–30% of breast cancers,
Bose et al. estimated that about 1.6% of breast cancer
patients possess a HER2 mutation [13]. They found that
seven HER2 mutations activated the protein, as reflected
in its enzyme activity, and downstream HER2 signaling
in mouse xenografts. This observation led to a trial of
neratinib, a panHER TKI for patients with refractory
HER2 positive BC [13].
Considering this role of HER2 mutations as
a driver oncogene, we developed a targeted NGS
platform, which we call CancerSCAN™, using the
83 most representative genes (Supplemental Table 1).
We used the HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (Illumina,
USA) to investigate the mutational profile of tissues
from patients with refractory MBC whose disease
progressed after conventional treatments. We focused
specifically on HER2 mutations. We also performed

RESULTS
Patients’ clinicopathological features (Table 1)
From March 2013 to Nov 2014, 36 patients with
MBC that was refractory to conventional treatments
were enrolled, and fresh frozen tumour tissues were
collected from metastatic sites for targeted sequencing,
CancerSCAN™ analysis, and RNA sequencing. Thirty-six
tumour samples were analyzed; two patients were
excluded because of failure of quality control (QC). The
median age at diagnosis of the 36 patients was 45 years
(range 26–64). Fourteen patients were hormone receptor
(HR)-positive (defined as ER and/or PgR positive).
Thirteen BC patients were HER2 positive and 11 patients
were triple negative. The median number of chemotherapy
regimens before biopsy was 5 (range 3–8) (Table 1).
The median follow-up duration from the date of biopsy
was 15 months (range 5–20). The median OS time from
distant metastasis to death (mOS) was 42.7 months (range
10–81). Among 14 HER2-positive patients, median OS of
the patients with HER2 mutation was 20.2 months, which
was much shorter than those without HER2 mutation
(48.6 months).

NGS using cancerSCAN™
The mean coverage of 36 patients was 941.3× with
99.0% over 100× (Supplemental Table 2). Figure 1 shows
the mutational profiles of the 36 patients with refractory
MBC. Thirty-five of the 36 patients (97.2%) harboured
at least one genetic alteration including copy number
variations. A heat-map of mutations of the 83 genes in
samples from the 36 patients is shown in Figure 2. A total
of 140 genetic alterations were detected in the samples
from the 36 patients. Genes in which somatic alterations
were detected frequently included TP53 (27 cases, 75%),
ERBB2 (17 cases, 47%), PIK3CA (12 cases, 33%), NF1
(five cases, 14%), FGFR (three cases, 8%), PTEN (three
cases, 8%), ARID1 (three cases, 8%), RB1 (two cases,
6%), PIK3R1 (one case, 3%), CDH1 (one case, 3%), and
AKT1 (one case, 3%), as shown in Figure 1.

HER2 mutational status of the 36 refractory
MBC patients (Table 2, Figure 2)
HER2 mutations were found in six of the 36 patients
(16.7%, Figure 2). One patient was ER-positive, and the
other five patients were HER2-positive. Figure 3 shows
the gene maps of the HER2 mutational status of the
six patients who harboured HER2 mutations along with

the TCGA results. HER2 mutations in three patients were
in the receptor ligand domain (RLD). In one patient,
the mutation was in the protein tyrosine kinase domain
(PTKD), and in the other HER2-negative patient, the
mutation was in the growth factor receptor domain
(GFRD) (Figure 3). To confirm the mutations in primary
tissue, we also genotyped the available archival primary
tissue for two patients. We identified one mutation (S413L)
with a similar allele frequency to that of metastatic tissue,
but none was detected for the other patient.

The VAF percentages were much lower in our series than
in the TCGA dataset.

Standardized mRNA expression values of HER2 show
a linear relationship with HER2 copy numbers. The mutation
status of the HER2 gene did not alter the mRNA level
expression of the HER2 gene in the patients (Figure 5A).

To confirm the low-frequency HER2 mutation, we
performed digital PCR assays with negative controls.
Among the five samples with HER2 mutations, all
mutant alleles in the NGS were detected by digital PCR
with similar allele frequency (Figure 4). In each negative
control, the signals were much lower in the mutant alleles
than in the positive samples (Table 3).

Among the patients with an increased HER2 copy number,
the average mRNA expression level of the HER2-HER3
pathway differed between the patients with a HER2
mutation and those with the wild-type HER2 (Figure 5B).
This was related to down-regulation of several components
in the pathway, such as GRB2, PIK3CB, and RAF1
(Supplemental Table 4). Growth Receptor Biding protein 2
(GRB2) was the most significantly down-regulated gene in
the HER2-mutated samples. The treatment history of the
patients and their GRB2 expression levels are summarized
in Tables 2 and 4.

and Table 2, these five patients had HER2-positive BC with
HER2 amplification as well as HER2 mutations. However,
these mutations did not involve the same site: three were
missense and two were truncation mutations, and there was
no mutation in the PTKD (Figure 3). Interestingly, no patient
was both ER-positive and HER2-positive. All five patients
with HER2 mutations in the HER2-amplified BC were
HR-negative. Most importantly, four of the five patients
did not show any durable clinical response to trastuzumaband/or lapatinib- containing chemotherapies for more than
12 months (Table 4). They were HER2-positive patients with
MBC whose disease was refractory to targeted therapies
including trastuzumab-DM1.

DISCUSSION

To evaluate the role of HER2 mutations in HER2positive refractory MBC, clinical outcomes and the disease
course of the five HER2-positive patients with HER2
mutations were investigated. As shown in Figures 1 and 2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our genomic study results show a higher incidence
(16.7%) of HER2 mutations in patients with refractory
MBCs than in other series, which is merely 1.6%

[13, 16]. This difference may relate to this population
of refractory patients or to the deep sequencing method
used. Most importantly, our study suggests that HER2
mutations in patients with HER2-amplified BC may
contribute to resistance to anti-HER2-directed therapy
with chemotherapies, even though only low frequencies
of the mutations were found (Table 2), which imply
HER2 mutation could be one of the predictive markers of
HER2 directed therapy and new resistance mechanism of

HER2 pathway in breast cancer. Furthermore, this finding
was supported by GRB2 downregulation, which is downstream of HER2 pathway even though it did not validated
CancerSCAN™ (GRB2 is not included in CancerSCAN™
panel). Lim et al., reported down-regulation of GRB2 in
heregulin-stimulated-HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells that lead to reduced proliferation through inactivation
of the Akt pathway [14]. It is unclear whether the downregulation of GRB2 is a consequence of HER2 mutation.

It is also possible that the down-regulation of GRB2 might
be caused by drug exposure. Decreased expression of
GRB2 in lapatinib-treated BC cell lines has been reported
[15]. As most (or all) of the HER2-amplified patients in
our study had been exposed to HER2-targeting drugs, it
is also possible that down-regulation of the GRB2 gene
and HER2 pathways might be caused by the treatment,
coincidently overlapped with the mutational status of the
patient sample. Further functional study of these mutations
using an in-vitro model may reveal this relationship.
Insufficient amount of GBR2 product makes it hard to
deliver an HER2-triggered oncogenic signal, therefore
patients may be less dependent on HER2-targeted drugs.
In spite of this limitation, we decided to try to improve
the accuracy of the method to identify HER2 mutations.
To exclude false-positive results and to evaluate whether
these HER2 mutations are recurrent, we performed digital
PCR with the same tumour tissues and CancerSCAN™
from archival breast tumour tissues. Our results suggest
that there may be a patient population that receives little of
no benefit from HER2-targeted therapies even though they
have HER2-overexpressing BCs. HER2 mutations may be
a main reason for this primary resistance to HER2-directed
therapies.
Several mechanisms are thought to be responsible
for resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Several
mechanisms of resistance to both trastuzumab and
lapatinib have been identified in preclinical studies
[17–23]. However, few of these have been validated
prospectively in the clinic [6, 24, 25]. Unfortunately, the
identification of a robust clinical or molecular predictor
of trastuzumab benefit, including HER2 itself, has proven
challenging [26–29]. There are no reports that HER2
somatic mutations play a role in primary resistance in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HER2-amplified BCs, especially for patients with heavily
pretreated disease, and there is insufficient scientific
evidence to support this rationale.
Our results suggest that HER2 mutations may be
useful as a predictive marker to identify which patients
will not benefit from HER2-directed therapy. Emerging
clinical data suggest that combinations of therapies
targeting the HER2- signaling network at multiple points
early in the natural history of HER2-positive breast
cancer can abrogate drug resistance. For this reason,
double-blockades may be regarded as an alternative
for overcoming resistance. Obviously, patients with
HER2 mutations will not be offered this therapeutic
option because of the low activity of HER2 pathway in
this population. Paradoxically, HER2 mutations are not
considered to be the main driver of genetic alterations
to override tumour aggressiveness, unlike in other
malignancies, such as NSCLC and colorectal carcinomas
[30–34]. HER2 somatic mutations have been shown
recently to drive tumorigenesis in HER2-negative breast
cancers [13]. We found a HER2 mutation in one HER2negative patient (1/36, 2.6%) in the same site found in a
previous report [13]. However, the other HER2 mutations
were found mainly in patients with HER2-amplification
(Table 2, Figure 3). Additionally, most of these mutations
were recurrent mutations, although they only occurred
in low frequencies. This result may derive from the deep
targeted sequencing of CancerSCAN™, which may explain
why deep targeted sequencing is needed for all exon sites
as well as hot spots.
What remains a challenge is determining the precise
resistance mechanism(s) in this particular type of patient.
Answering this question will lead to the development of
individualized and effective therapies for refractory MBC.

This will require commitment to in-depth functional
studies and molecular analysis of the tumors. Alternatively,
the increasing use of preoperative therapy should
provide a clinical research platform for the prediction
of the response to combinations of anti-HER2 agents
with cytotoxic chemotherapy to stratify patients for the
following treatment(s) to improve therapeutic outcomes for
patients with refractory HER2-positive BC. These residual
cancers may be interrogated with open-ended molecular
approaches to select those patients who might need to avoid
conventional HER2-directed therapies.
In conclusion, HER2 mutations in patients with
refractory BC may help explain the resistance to con­
ventional HER2-directed therapies in HER2-positive BC.

adaptor ligation, and amplification. After hybridization of
the library with bait sequences for 27 hours, the captured
library was purified and amplified with an index barcode
tag, and the library quality and quantity were assessed.
Sequencing of the exome library was performed using the
100 bp paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster
Kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS Kit (Illumina).

Variants detection using the customized cancer
panel (CancerSCAN™)
Sequence reads were mapped to the human genome
(hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [35].
Duplicate read removal was performed using Picard and
SAMtools [36]. Local alignment was optimized using the
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [37]. Variant calling
was done only in regions targeted in CancerSCAN™.
To detect single nucleotide variants, we integrated the
results of three kinds of variant caller, which increased
the sensitivity [38–40]. We used Pindel to detect indels
[41]. Copy number variations were calculated for
targeted regions by dividing the read depth per exon by
the estimated normal reads per exon using an in-house
reference. Among the variants obtained from the tumour
tissue, germ-line events were filtered using the results of
the matched blood sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We conducted a prospective study at the Samsung
Medical Center (SMC) from March 2013 to November
2014. The patients with breast cancer who progressed
after or were refractory to conventional treatments,
including endocrine therapies or chemotherapies such
as anthracycline- and taxane- containing regimens, were
recruited into this trial. Patients with HER2-positive BC
had received at least two HER2-targeted therapies for
2 years before they enrolled in this trial.

Gene expression and pathway analysis
FASTQ files from RNA sequencing of the SMC’s
sample from MBC patients were mapped to the human
genome reference (hg19) using the bow-tie method [42].
TopHat was used to generate read counts per gene [43].
We normalized each patient’s gene expression data to
publically available breast cancer data. Gene expression
data from the TCGA BRCA project (tumour = 526,
normal = 61) were used for normalization. The statistical
algorithm COMBAT was applied to reduce the platform
and batch effects on data analysis [44]. After reducing
the batch effect, we standardize each patients’ gene
expression value using the mean and standard deviation
for gene expression obtained from normal breast tissue.
An individualized pathway alteration score was obtained
using the IPAS method [45].

Genomic DNA extraction and quality
measurement
Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh frozen
tumour tissue and matched normal blood specimens using
a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
Genomic DNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a
NanoDrop 8000 UV-Vis spectrometer (Thermo Scientific
Inc., Willington, DE, USA), Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life
Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA), and 2200
TapeStation instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA).

Sequencing using a customized cancer panel
(CancerSCAN™)
Genomic DNA (250 ng) from each tissue was
sheared in a Covaris S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris,
Woburn MA, USA) and used for the construction of a
library using CancerSCAN™ probes and a SureSelect
XT reagent kit, HSQ (Agilent Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. This panel is designed to
enrich exons of 83 genes (Supplemental Table 1), covering
366.2kb of the human genome. After enriched exome
libraries were multiplexed, the libraries were sequenced
on a HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (Illumina). Briefly,
a paired-end DNA sequencing library was prepared
through gDNA shearing, end-repair, A-tailing, paired-end

and HTS in consultation with TJA. Histopathological
analyses were performed by IGD. YHP provided overall
supervision for the project and wrote the manuscript with
HTS and KHP and TJA, with input from HHJ and JYK.

Digital PCR was performed using a QuantStudio
3D Digital PCR System platform comprising a Gene
Amp 9700 PCR machine including a chip adapter kit, an
automatic chip loader, and the QuantStudio 3D Instrument
(Life Technologies, Inc.). The assay IDs of the primers
and TaqMan probes are listed in Supplemental Table 5.
We prepared 18 reaction mixtures containing 9 ul of
two-fold QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR Master Mix (Life
Technologies, Inc.), 0.9 ul of 20-fold TaqMan Assay by
Design primer-probe mix, 2 ul diluted gDNA (100 ng/l),
and 6.1 ul nuclease-free water (Biosesang, Korea). We
loaded 14.5 ul of the reaction mixture onto a QuantStudio
3D Digital PCR 20K Chip (Life Technologies, Inc.) using
an automatic chip loader according to the manufactures’
instructions. Loaded chips underwent amplification in
the Gene Amp 9700 PCR System under the following
conditions: 96°C for 10 min, 42 cycles at 60°C for 2 min
and at 98°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step at
60°C for 2 min. After amplification, the chips were imaged
on the QuantStudio 3D Instrument, which assesses raw
data and calculates the estimated concentration of the
nucleic acid sequence targeted by the FAM and VIC dyelabelled probes according to the Poisson distribution. The
resulting data are reported in copies/ul along with the
results of the quality assessment. For deeper analysis of
the obtained chip data, QuantStudio 3D Analysis Suite
Cloud Software (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for
relative and quantitative data analysis.
