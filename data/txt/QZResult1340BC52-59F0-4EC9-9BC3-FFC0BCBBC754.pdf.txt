through Notch3-Dependent Signaling

Abstract
Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common actionable genetic
abnormalities yet discovered in lung cancer. However, targeting these mutations with kinase inhibitors is not
curative in advanced disease and has yet to demonstrate an impact on potentially curable, early-stage disease, with
some data suggesting adverse outcomes. Here, we report that treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines
with erlotinib, while showing robust cell death, enriches the ALDHþ stem-like cells through EGFR-dependent
activation of Notch3. In addition, we demonstrate that erlotinib treatment increases the clonogenicity of lung
cancer cells in a sphere-forming assay, suggesting increased stem-like cell potential. We demonstrate that inhibition
of EGFR kinase activity leads to activation of Notch transcriptional targets in a g secretase inhibitor-sensitive
manner and causes Notch activation, leading to an increase in ALDH highþ cells. We also ﬁnd a kinase-dependent
physical association between the Notch3 and EGFR receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch3. This could
explain the worsened survival observed in some studies of erlotinib treatment at early-stage disease, and suggests
that speciﬁc dual targeting might overcome this adverse effect. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5572–84. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Modern approaches to cancer therapeutic development are
becoming increasingly selective, sometimes targeting single
intermolecular interactions or mutated oncoproteins, allowing
for dramatic efﬁcacy in deﬁned subsets of patients with
speciﬁc genetic abnormalities. This is the case for epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI),
geﬁtinib and erlotinib, in the setting of exon 19 deleted or
L858R point mutated lung cancer tumors (1, 2). However,
responses to TKIs are often short-lived and have failed to
result in cures, alone or in combinations, in the metastatic
setting. TKIs have also failed to improve survival after curativeintent therapy of early-stage disease. For example, one clinical
trial, SWOG 0023, randomized stage III patients to geﬁtinib
therapy or placebo after curative-intent chemotherapy and

radiation (3). Surprisingly, the study had to be stopped because
the overall survival was signiﬁcantly worse in the arm treated
with the kinase inhibitor, unrelated to drug toxicity. In earlierstage tumors, stages I and II, where complete surgical resection
results in cures in more than half of patients, the addition of
geﬁtinib after surgery might be expected to dramatically
improve survival, particularly in patients with EGFR-mutated
tumors. However, geﬁtinib failed to increase either PFS or OS,
with a strong trend toward worsened overall survival with a
hazard ratio of 1.2 in the entire group (4). The group with the
largest expected beneﬁt, those with activating EGFR mutations, also trended to doing worse than the unselected group
with a hazard ratio of 3.1 for an increased risk of death (4). We
hypothesized that the worsened survival in the curative-intent
setting is a consequence of the fact that while debulking of
tumors underlies the clinical beneﬁt observed for incurable
metastatic disease, EGFR inhibition could paradoxically
increase clonogens in the tumor decreasing long-term survival
in curative-intent therapy, which in turn becomes apparent
after the cessation of inhibitor therapy. We set out to test these
hypotheses in this study.
Notch receptors are highly conserved, single pass type I
transmembrane proteins known to play a role in cell proliferation, cell death, and differentiation (5). They have also been
linked to multiple human disorders, including cancers where
different Notch family members are implicated as oncogenes
or tumor suppressor genes in different settings (6–8). In lung
cancers, Notch was originally implicated in an epithelial tumor
by the discovery of a chromosome translocation causing
massive overexpression of Notch3 (9) and subsequently Notch
receptors and ligands have been found to be overexpressed in a
majority of solid tumors, including non–small cell lung cancer

Erlotinib-Induced Stem-like Cells in Lung Cancer

(NSCLC; refs. 9 and 10). Transgenic mice overexpressing an
activated Notch3 in the bronchial epithelium showed perinatal
lethality because of arrested differentiation of type II progenitors, and the absence of type I pneumocytes (11).
More recently, multiple studies have shown the Notch
pathway to be important in stem cell biology (12–15). Notch
has also been shown to play a role in cancer stem cells in many
tumor types, including breast, brain, and lung cancer (16–19).
In breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), formation of mammospheres, an indicator of stem-like cells, is decreased upon
treatment with Notch inhibitors (18, 20, 21).
In lung cancer, ALDH positivity has been convincingly
associated with stem-like cell characteristics and inhibition
of Notch3 abrogated the colony and tumor-forming ability of
ALDHþ cells (15, 19). High expression of ALDH1 by immunohistochemistry was also associated with a worsened survival
after curative-intent surgical resection (19). This was recently
corroborated by studies of ALDH7 in resected lung tumors (22).
In this study, we sought to determine if Notch signaling
could be enhanced by EGFR inhibition, resulting in differential
effects on the stem-like cell population of human lung cancer
cells with mutated or wild-type EGFR. We found that while
inhibition of EGFR leads to a dramatic reduction of tumor cell
numbers, it also leads to a potent activation of the Notch
pathway with an increase in the relative abundance of ALDHþ
stem-like cells in a Notch3-dependent fashion and an increase
in the clonogenicity as determined by spheroid assay. Combined inhibition of EGFR and Notch3 receptors substantially
reduces the expansion of stem-like cells. This is the ﬁrst report
showing erlotinib treatment activates Notch in human lung
cancer, resulting in an enriched stem-like populations in a
Notch3-, and not Notch1-dependent manner. In addition, this
is also the ﬁrst study to demonstrate kinase-dependent complex formation of these two receptors leading to the tyrosine
phosphorylation of Notch3 in human lung cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and transfections
HCC2429, HCC827, and HCC4006 cells were maintained in
RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. H358, HCC827, and
HCC4006 cells were obtained from ATCC within 6 months of
the experiments reported, and were identity-veriﬁed by STR
analysis and certiﬁed as mycoplasma-free. Transfections were
performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Ligands and inhibitors
EGF was purchased from R&D Systems. Erlotinib was a
generous gift from Dr. William Pao at Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN. g secretase inhibitor (GSI; PF-03084014) was
kindly provided by Pﬁzer Global Research and Development,
La Jolla Laboratories and was described previously (23, 24).
Antibodies
Following antibodies were used in this study: EGFR (1005) is
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; EGFR (Ab12) and EGFR (Ab15)
are from Neomarker; Notch1 (5B5), Notch3 (8G5), and Notch3
(D11B8), and EGFR (pY1173) obtained from Cell Signaling

Technology. Mouse-anti phosphotyrosine is from BD Transduction Laboratories. b-Tubulin antibodies were obtained
from Sigma.
Plasmid constructs
The pCDNA-EGFR and pCDNA-EGFR (D816A) and Renilla
luciferase constructs were provided by Graham Carpenter
(Vanderbilt University). Dr. Thao P. Dang (University of Viginia
School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA) provided pCMVFLAG-N3DA and pHES1-luciferase constructs. The TP1-luc
reporter construct contains 12 tandem repeats of CSL binding
sites upstream of luciferase.
Coimmunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation, and
Western blotting
Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline, harvested, and lysed with NP40 buffer (10 mmol/L phosphate buffer, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 1% Nonidet
P40, 10% glycerol) for coimmunoprecipitation experiments
or lysed with RIPA buffer (10 mmol/L phosphate buffer, 120
mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% DOC,
0.1% SDS) supplemented with complete mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor
mixture cocktails 2 and 3 (sigma), 2 mmol/L NaF and pervanadate for immunoprecipitation for detection of phosphorylation. Equal amount of lysates were precipitated using
appropriate antibodies and protein G magnetic beads, or equal
amounts of protein were mixed with SDS sample buffer and
separated on SDS-PAGE before Western blot analysis.
Aldeﬂuor assay and ﬂow cytometry
The Aldeﬂuor Assay Kit (Stem Cell Technologies) was used
to determine the ALDHþ cells. The assay was performed
according to manufacturer's instructions with modiﬁcations.
Cells were suspended in Aldeﬂuor assay buffer and divided into
two groups. One group was pretreated for 10 minutes with
ALDH-speciﬁc inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB)
before incubation with ALDH enzyme substrate bodipy-aminoacetaldehyde (BAA) for 45 minutes at 37 C. Cells were
centrifuged and resuspended in a fresh Aldeﬂuor assay buffer
to remove the unutilized substrate. Cells were analyzed on a
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) ﬂow cytometer. For the analysis
of ALDHþ cells, DEAB-treated sample was used as a negative
control and ALDH activity in presence of DEAB was considered
as a baseline.
Pulmosphere formation assay
To study the stem-like cell phenotype, sphere formation
assays were performed as described previously (25) with modiﬁcations. HCC827 cells treated with vehicle control or erlotinib
were trypsinized and counted using Luna automated cell
counter. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1,000 cells
per well in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
35 mg/mL bovine pituitary extract (Life Technologies), N2
supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL (Life Technologies), basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (Roche), and 50%
Geltrex LDEV-free, hESC-qualiﬁed, reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (Geltrex; Life Technologies). Cells

Results
Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR increases the fraction
of ALDHþ cells in lung cancer cell lines
We tested whether there is a relationship between EGFR
inhibition and the fraction and number of stem-like cells in
NSCLC cell lines. EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells
were treated with DMSO or 0.1 mmol/L erlotinib and the
medium was changed every day with fresh drug. Equal
numbers of cells were subjected to ALDH enzymatic activity
assays with the ALDHþ and ALDH cell populations quantiﬁed using ﬂow cytometry. We found that HCC4006 and
HCC827 NSCLC cell lines, each with an EGFR activating
mutation (EGFR DE746-A750; Fig. 1A and B), showed dramatic increases in the fraction of ALDHþ cells upon treatment with erlotinib compared with DMSO-treated cells
(Table 1). Interestingly, for HCC4006 cells, which have very
low basal ALDH activity, whereas treatment with erlotinib
killed much of the ALDH population, it seemed to maintain
or even increase the total number of ALDHþ cells by a small

percentage. However, unlike HCC4006 cells, HCC827 cells
seem to have a large fraction of cells with low-to-moderate
baseline ALDH activity (3.5% for HCC4006 vs. 17.7% for
HCC827). This basal activity may not accurately reﬂect the
stem-like cell population. When the analysis is based on
those cells with the highest ALDH activity, by gating on the
DMSO-treated cells without DEAB, the total number of
ALDHþ cells with very high activity increased in the HCC827
cells from 491,200 to 782,100 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B; Supplementary Table S1). This demonstrates that
although erlotinib treatment causes a large reduction in the
total cell numbers for each cell lines, the total number of
ALDH highþ cells is increased. Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B shows that both low- and high-positive fractions
increase between 3 and 5 days of erlotinib treatment in
HCC827 cells.
We further wanted to explore if this phenomenon was also
present in H1650 cells, which are also EGFR mutant but resistant to erlotinib because of loss of PTEN (26). Interestingly,
erlotinib treatment also had no effect on the ALDH populations
in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Additional studies with
A549 and H358 cells carrying wild-type EGFR and a K-RAS
mutation (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B; ref. 27) also
showed increased ALDH activity upon exposure to erlotinib.
Unlike H1650, which are completely insensitive to erlotinib, the
H358 cell line and A549 cell line are somewhat sensitive to
erlotinib (H358 more so than A549; ref. 28) and also show
increases in the fraction of ALDHþ cells with erlotinib treatment. These data suggest that this phenomenon is not just
restricted to cells with an EGFR activating mutation, but
limited to those with some EGFR-signaling dependence, and
that EGFR activity is coupled with ALDH activity.
Erlotinib treatment enhances pulmosphere-forming
potential in EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells
Previous studies have demonstrated that ALDHþ cells possess features similar to cancer stem cells such as increased
pulmosphere-forming ability. To determine if the residual cell
population after erlotinib treatment is more stem-like, we
performed the pulmosphere formation assay. HCC827 cells
were treated with 0.1 mmol/L erlotinib for 5 days. Remaining
cells were allowed to recover under the regular growth conditions for 4 days and subjected to sphere formation culture

assay. As expected from the ALDHþ data, compared with
DMSO, erlotinib-treated cells showed an increased number
and size of the pulmospheres in semisolid matrix (Fig. 2A and
B). We also performed a soft agar colony formation assay,
which measures anchorage-independent growth and is an
indicator for cell transformation using H358 cells. Cells treated
with erlotinib showed signiﬁcant increase in number of colonies formed compared with DMSO control (Fig. 2C and D).
These data clearly suggest that erlotinib treatment increases
the clonogenic potential in the surviving population of cells.
EGFR signaling downregulates Notch-mediated
transcriptional activity in a kinase-dependent manner
To assess if the erlotinib-mediated stem-like cell phenotype
is because of modulation of transcriptional activity of Notch,
we examined the Notch transcriptional activity in the presence
of wild-type or kinase-inactive EGFR. HEK293 cells were
transiently transfected with EGFR and Notch3-ICD along with
Notch inducible CSL-synthetic (Fig. 3A) or full-length Hes1
promoter-driven luciferase reporters (Fig. 3B). Two days after
transfection transcriptional activity was measured using a
luciferase assay. The coexpression of EGFR with Notch3-ICD
decreased Notch3-ICD–mediated CSL and Hes1 reporter activities in a dose-dependent manner. We further determined
if kinase activity is essential for EGFR-mediated negative
regulation of Notch3. Notch3-ICD was coexpressed with a
kinase-inactive mutant of EGFR and coexpression of this
kinase-inactive EGFR did not result in a decrease in Notchmediated transcriptional activity, demonstrating that EGFR
negatively regulates Notch activity through its tyrosine kinase
activity. Interestingly, there was a slight increase in reporter
activity compared with baseline when EGFR (KD) was transfected (Fig. 3A and B), which may have been because of
interference with endogenous EGFR activity. To make certain
that the EGFR transfection was not having any other effect on
the cell populations or the reporter in the absence of Notch,
EGFR and EGFR (KD) were transfected with reporter alone
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We did not observe any EGFR-mediated Notch reporter activity in the absence of Notch overexpression. In addition, we tested if pharmacologic inhibition
of EGFR using erlotinib can stimulate the expression of Notch
target genes in lung cancer cells. The qRT-PCR analysis of Hes1
expression showed a signiﬁcant increase after 24 or 48 hours of

treatment with erlotinib in HCC827 cells (Fig. 3C). This demonstrates EGFR kinase activity inhibits Notch signaling, and thus
erlotinib treatment relieves this inhibition, resulting in Notch
transcriptional activation.
GSI treatment eliminates erlotinib-induced stem-like
cells by decreasing Notch activity
The major Notch pathway inhibitors in clinical testing are
GSIs (29). These compounds block the ﬁnal activation (S3
cleavage) step in canonical Notch signaling. GSIs inhibit the
cleavage of the Notch receptor, preventing release of the
intracellular domain into the cytoplasm and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, thus abrogating canonical signal
activation for all the Notch receptors. Because we ﬁnd that
EGFR inhibition increases ALDHþ cells and also activates
Notch transcriptional activity, we sought to determine if the
erlotinib-induced increase of ALDHþ cells is inhibited by
treatment with a GSI. Concomitant treatment with GSI PF03084014 and erlotinib reduced the number of ALDHþ cells in
both HCC4006 and HCC827 cells observed with erlotinib alone
(Fig. 4A and B). Next we sought to identify if erlotinib-stim-

5576

ulated Notch transcriptional activity is sensitive to GSI. Consistent with the GSI sensitivity of erlotinib-induced stem-like
cells, both HCC827 and HCC4006 showed increased expression
of Hes1 and Hey1 with erlotinib treatment, which was sensitive
to PF-0308401 following 3 days of treatment (Fig. 4C). These
data support the hypothesis that erlotinib increases ALDH
positivity through activation of Notch signaling and suggests a
potential clinical strategy for overcoming this effect through
combined EGFR and Notch inhibition.
The erlotinib-induced increase in the ALDHþ fraction in
lung cancer cells is dependent on Notch3, but not Notch1
To determine whether erlotinib-mediated expansion of
ALDHþ cells is mediated by the Notch1 and/or Notch3
receptors, we evaluated the role of Notch1 and 3 in the
erlotinib-induced increase of ALDHþ cells using the EGFRmutated HCC4006 and HCC827 cell lines. Cells were transfected with nontargeting control (NTC) or three separate
Notch1 or Notch3 siRNAs and treated with erlotinib. Knockdown for both Notch1 and Notch3 receptors was efﬁcient
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). As expected, erlotinib

treatment stimulated a 5- and 3-fold increase in ALDHþ cells
in HCC4006 and HCC827, respectively. Although knockdown
of Notch1 had no effect on erlotinib-stimulated cells, the
Notch3 knockdown completely abolished this effect to baseline levels (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that erlotinib induces
stem-like cells through Notch3 and not Notch1.
Notch and EGFR receptors coprecipitate and this
interaction is dependent on EGFR kinase activity
Next, we sought to determine if there is an EGFR activation–
dependent functional association between EGFR and Notch
receptors in HCC2429 cells, a cell line that expresses wild-type
EGFR and both Notch1 and Notch3 receptors and multiple
Notch ligands, and in which the combination of Notch and
EGFR-targeted therapies show an increased efﬁcacy (10, 30).
Cells were stimulated with EGF for increasing amounts of time
and total EGFR was precipitated, and blotted for Notch3. These
analyses identiﬁed clear EGF-dependent coprecipitation of

Notch3 with EGFR (Fig. 6A). In the absence of ligand, little
or no association was observed between EGFR and Notch
receptors, indicating that the association is ligand (EGF)dependent. To further validate the interaction between EGFR
and Notch3, coimmunoprecipitations were performed using
three different antibodies that target distinct epitopes on the
EGFR protein. Western blot analyses showed that Notch3
coimmunoprecipitates with all three EGFR antibodies, and
this association was further enhanced when stimulated with
EGF (Supplementary Fig. S6).
We further tested if the association between EGFR and
Notch receptor is dependent on the kinase activity of EGFR.
HCC4006 and HCC827 cells expressing constitutively active
EGFR were treated with vehicle control or erlotinib and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation. As expected, control cells
showed strong interaction between Notch and EGFR, and
erlotinib treatment completely abolished this interaction (Fig.

demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch and to identify
Notch as a novel direct or indirect substrate for the EGFR

To conﬁrm that the observed tyrosine phosphorylation of

treated with vehicle or erlotinib for 1 or 24 hours. Treatment
with erlotinib reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch3
in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 8A and B). Furthermore, the

that Notch3 phosphorylation is because of EGFR kinase activation. A similar pattern was observed for tyrosine-1173 auto

To further address if EGFR-mediated Notch3 tyrosine phosphorylation is indeed a key regulatory event that modulates the
stem-like phenotype in lung cancer cells we used H1650 cells,
which do not show an increase in ALDH activity in response to
erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2), and also show a
continuously active EGFR in the presence of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S7). Phosphotyrosine analysis of Notch3
revealed that under basal conditions Notch3 is tyrosine phosphorylated. Treatment with erlotinib did not prevent the
Notch3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S7),
suggesting that inhibition of EGFR is a key event required for
the Notch3 activation.

Erlotinib-Induced Stem-like Cells in Lung Cancer

A

other pathways. This causes unexpected results when highly
speciﬁc inhibitors are used, but understanding the mechanisms and consequences of these events leads to identiﬁcation
of novel signaling cascades and often to targeted solutions. A
good example of this is the upregulation of the MEK pathway
and the increased incidence of squamous skin cancers with
BRAF inhibition in BRAF mutant melanomas, and combinations with MEK inhibitors is not only more effective against
the tumor, but also reduces the skin cancer incidence (32).
Similarly, inhibition of mTOR results in the feedback activation of AKT signaling (33). These changes are not "adaptive
resistance" pathways in the sense that cancers are acquiring
secondary drivers to overcome a primary driver, but rather a
consequence of normal physiologic counter-regulatory pathways observable even in normal cells that are made apparent
by pathway-speciﬁc intervention in cancer.
In this study, we show that erlotinib treatment of EGFRmutated lung cancer cells, while dramatically reducing the
growth and number of tumor cells, also directly induces Notch
signaling, and that this effect is observed with both mutated,
constitutively activated, EGFR and wild-type EGFR. As it is
becoming increasingly evident that Notch signaling is important in the maintenance of subsets of tumor cells with a high
clonogenic capacity, often referred to as "cancer stem–like
cells" or "tumor-initiating cells" (16, 34), this upregulation may
have clinical consequences. The involvement of Notch in this
cell subpopulation is well characterized in brain, breast, and
embryonic tumors (18, 35, 36). In lung cancer, ALDH positivity
has been found to be a good marker for a tumor cell subset with
stem-like cell properties and this subset is dependent on
Notch3 for clonogenicity and tumorigenic potential (19). In
this study, we document a reciprocal activation of EGFR and
Notch in human lung cancer, and thus a previously unrecognized role for constitutively activated EGFR in repressing stemlike cells in EGFR-driven NSCLC cell lines. This may underlie
the fact that advanced lung tumors with mutated EGFR have a
much better prognosis than those with wild-type EGFR, even

Notch3 receptor. A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Notch3
antibody followed by Western blot analysis using a phosphotyrosine

Discussion
Cellular signaling pathways are complex and interconnected, with inhibition of one pathway often resulting in
feedback regulation and parallel compensatory activation of

when treated with standard, nonkinase inhibitor therapies.
Treatment with erlotinib, while resulting in dramatic cell
death, also releases this Notch inhibition and paradoxically
promotes the stem-like cell population. It is unclear whether
erlotinib is sufﬁcient to induce ALDH positivity in an ALDH
negative cell, increase ALDH expression in ALDH low cells, or
promote proliferation of ALDH high cells.
We ﬁnd that this phenomenon was reversed with knockdown of Notch3, but not Notch1, suggesting that Notch3 plays
a crucial role in regulating stem-like cells, which is in agreement with previous studies (37). Interestingly, Notch1 seems to
play a sometimes opposing role, suppressing the growth of
stem-like cells, which also is in line with the earlier work (38),
and suggests that pan-Notch inhibition may not be optimal in
countering this effect.
Cross-regulation between EGFR and Notch signaling pathways has long been observed in genetic studies and has been
shown to be both cooperative and antagonistic, depending on
the cellular context (39). Similar to what we observe in lung
cancer, in Drosophila EGFR opposes Notch signaling in multiple developmental processes, and in fact loss of function
mutations in the Notch pathway can compensate for hypomorphic alleles of EGFR (40, 41). In C. elegans vulvar development, it has also been shown that EGFR and LIN-12/Notch
have opposing effects on cell fate determination (42). The
functional interaction of these pathways has been less clear
in mammals, but has recently been shown to be important in
neural stem cell number and renewal, where EGFR signaling
expands the progenitor cells and depletes the stem cells by
ubiquitination mediated downregulation of Notch1 (43). In
skin cancer, antagonistic effects of Notch1 and EGFR have been
shown, where inhibition of EGFR leads to increased differentiation of squamous cell carcinoma cells and increased resistance to apoptosis. However, combined inhibition of EGFR and
Notch activity signiﬁcantly induced the Notch-mediated apoptosis and differentiation (44). Nevertheless, the biochemical
basis of the EGFR and Notch interaction has been unclear, and
likewise its role in lung cancer biology.
We show here that EGFR directly modulates Notch activity
in human lung cancers, and that there is a kinase-dependent
physical association of the two receptors. EGFR has previously
been shown to interact with transcription factors such as
STAT3 and regulate gene transcription in the nucleus (25). In
this context our ﬁndings suggest another mode of EGFR-driven
transcriptional regulation mediated through the interaction of
EGFR with Notch3. Our studies also demonstrated erlotinibsensitive tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch3 associated with
negative regulation of Notch transcriptional activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation on the Notch-ICD is novel and represents
a potential mechanism for the crosstalk of these two pathways.
The discovery of mutations in the EGFR receptor has
revolutionized the management of patients with advanced
lung cancer and deﬁned a new era of highly targeted therapies
selected for tumors with aberrantly activated pathways.
Patients whose tumors contain activating mutations of EGFR
have dramatic tumor regressions when treated with EGFRselective TKIs. However, none of these patients are cured and
all eventually relapse and die from their disease. It is very clear

5582

that these inhibitors must be used continuously for life in most
cases, as cessation results in a rapid tumor "ﬂare" (45). In fact, in
the setting of curative-intent therapy and deﬁned periods of
adjuvant EGFR TKI treatment, although relapse-free survival
seems good while on drug, ultimately worsened survival or
trends in that direction are seen compared with placebo,
suggesting that modulation of EGFR in a selective way may
have unforeseen adverse consequences not apparent in the
metastatic setting.
The most common cause of acquired resistance in EGFRmutated tumors is the development of a "gatekeeper" mutation, T790M that reactivates the EGFR tyrosine kinase and
makes it resistant to erlotinib. The other common mechanism
is the development of a bypass signal (such as MET ampliﬁcation) that circumvents the loss of EGFR signaling. These
types of resistance mechanisms cannot explain the adverse
outcomes observed with treatment in early-stage disease. In
this study, we ﬁnd that erlotinib activates the developmentally
important Notch pathway. This provides a potential explanation for the clinical observations in that while tumors bearing
these activating mutations may undergo dramatic reduction in
tumor bulk after EGFR-targeted therapies, EGFR inhibition
may actually promote stem-like cells by activating Notch. The
tonic suppression of Notch by constitutively activated EGFR
may also explain the good prognosis of EGFR-mutated lung
cancers compared with EGFR wild-type tumors when treated
with standard chemotherapies, with median survivals of 20 to
30 months in several studies compared with 10 to 12 months
(46). Inhibition of the EGFR may thus shrink tumors causing
clinical beneﬁt in the metastatic setting, but in fact promote
stem-like cell characteristics and clonogenicity of the surviving
fraction in the adjuvant setting and this becomes apparent
upon stopping the inhibitor. It is also intriguing that tumors
with mutant EGFR seem to more often clinically relapse with
miliary disease and hundreds or thousands of lesions after
therapy with EGFR inhibitors than tumors containing wildtype EGFR (47).
These data thus suggest that caution should be observed in
treating patients who undergo curative-intent resections or
chemoradiation for tumors bearing activating mutations in
EGFR with EGFR inhibitors alone. These patients may actually
be harmed by adjuvant unopposed selective inhibition of EGFR
that becomes apparent upon stopping the therapy. We suggest
that in this setting, selective Notch3 inhibition combined with
EGFR TKI therapy should be explored.
