ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) are often among the earliest presenting
events in Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by the
deficiency of α-galactosidase A. Despite recent advances in clinical and molecular
characterization of FD, the pathophysiology of the GIS is still poorly understood.
To shed light either on differential clinical presentation or on intervariability of GIS
in FD, we genotyped 1936 genetic markers across 231 genes that encode for drugmetabolizing enzymes and drug transport proteins in 49 FD patients, using the DMET
Plus platform. All nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped within four
genes showed statistically significant differences in genotype frequencies between
FD patients who experienced GIS and patients without GIS: ABCB11 (odd ratio
(OR) = 18.07, P = 0,0019; OR = 8.21, P = 0,0083; OR=8.21, P = 0,0083; OR = 8.21,
P = 0,0083),SLCO1B1 (OR = 9.23, P = 0,0065; OR = 5.08, P = 0,0289; OR = 8.21,
P = 0,0083), NR1I3 (OR = 5.40, P = 0,0191) and ABCC5 (OR = 14.44, P = 0,0060). This
is the first study that investigates the relationships between genetic heterogeneity in
drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) related genes and
GIS in FD. Our findings provide a novel genetic variant framework which warrants
further investigation for precision medicine in FD.

onset angiokeratoma, acroparesthesias, gastrointestinal
disorders, hypohidrosisand characteristic corneal
and lenticular opacities [2, 3] to adult-onset variants
(residual α-GalA activity) with only cardiac [4] or renal
[5] symptoms. Heterozygous females show a variable
phenotype due to random X-inactivation [6]. However,
published data showed a high degree of intra-familial
phenotypic variability in patients carrying the same
mutation [7]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), with
agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta, has been reported to be
well tolerated and effective in FD [8–11]. Gastrointestinal
symptoms (GIS) are reported in approximately 60%
of FD patients and have a profound negative effect on
their quality of life. Post-prandial abdominal pain and
diarrhea are the most prevalent manifestations, while less
common GIS include nausea, vomiting, and early satiety
[12]. Despite recent advances in clinical and molecular
characterization of FD, the pathophysiology of the GIS is
still poorly understood.
Here, we have evaluated the intervariability of
GIS recurrence in a cohort of 49 FD patients. In order to
determine the involvement of genetic factors unrelated to
α-Gal A deficiency in the pathogenesis of GIS, we have
performed a profiling of 1936 common and complex
functional variants (SNPs, insertions, duplications, deletions)
across 231 genes that encode for drug-metabolizing enzymes
and drug transport proteins using the DMET Plus platform
(Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US).

than 95%. One SNP (rs2235033/ABCB1) failed to meet
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.05) and was excluded
from further analysis. Of the remaining 1935 SNPs, 1025
SNPs were polymorphic in our population and were
used in the association study. Nine SNPs in four genes
unrelated to α-Gal A deficiency (NR1I3, ABCC5, ABCB11,
SLCO1B1) resulted associated with GIS (Table 1).
The heterozygous genotype AG (rs2501870) in
the NR1I3 gene and the heterozygous genotype CT
(rs7636910) in the ABCC5 gene resulted more frequent in
patients with GIS compared to patients without GIS (67%
versus 27% P = 0.0191, and 92% versus 43% P = 0.0060,
respectively) (Table 2). Four ABCB11 polymorphisms
(rs497692, rs495714, rs496550, rs473351), in linkage
disequilibrium (LD), significantly correlated with GIS, and
the frequencies of the heterozygous genotypes CT were
significantly higher in FD patients with GIS (CT = 84%
versus 38% P = 0.0083, 92% versus 38% P = 0.0019, 84%
versus 38% P = 0.0083 and 82% versus 38% P = 0.0083,
respectively). In three SLCO1B1 variants (rs2291075,
rs11045819, rs2306283) the heterozygous genotypes (CT,
AC and AG, respectively) showed statistically differences
between the two groups, with higher frequencies in the
FD patients with GIS (respectively 84% versus 35%
P = 0.0065, 58% versus 22% P = 0.0289 and 84% versus
38% P = 0.0083, respectively), while the homozygous
genotypes CC in rs2291075 and rs11045819 were
associated with absence of GIS (respectively 43%
versus 8% P = 0.0371 and 70% versus 34% P = 0.0392,
respectively). These data were completely confirmed
by TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays (Figure 1). All
genotypes generated are reliable to 100% as we previously
demonstrated [13].

RESULTS
Prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms
The overall prevalence of GIS in the 49 evaluated
patients was 24.5% (n = 12). Abdominal pain was present
in 12 patients (24.5%) while diarrhea was reported in
11 patients (22.4%). One male patient complained only
abdominal pain, all the other patients had more than one
GI symptom: ten patients complained abdominal pain and
diarrhea, one patient had heartburn, belching and bloating
in addition to abdominal pain and diarrhea. The onset of
GIS in our patients occurred at a median age of 9.1 years
(range: 4–15 years). Ten out of the 12 patients with GIS
were under ERT. After a period between 12 and 24 months
of ERT, 40% patients (n = 4) reported an improvement in
frequency and severity of GIS, while the remaining 60%
(n = 6) reported no changes in GI manifestations after
starting the treatment. Genotype-phenotype correlation
revealed variability in the occurrence of GIS in related
individuals carrying the same mutation.

DISCUSSION
The pathophysiology of GIS in FD remains poorly
understood although it is plausible that deposition of
Gb3 in endothelial intestinal vasculature might cause
enteric neuropathy. Moreover, Gb3 also accumulates in
intestinal smooth muscle, and a direct myopathic effect,
or combined myopathy and neuropathy, has been also
suggested [14]. Enteropathy affecting the sympathetic
and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic
nervous system is also possible, being autonomic
nerve involvement previously reported in FD [15]. The
peripheral neuropathy in FD manifests as neuropathic
pain, reduced cold and warm sensation and possibly
gastrointestinal disturbances [16].
In the present study, we investigated the
relationships between genetic variants in ADME-related
genes and GIS in FD, genotyping 49 FD patients with the
DMET Plus microarray, that we have previously shown
to be a powerful tool for the detection of genetic variants
in ADME genes related to interindividual variability to
drug response and/or toxicity [13, 17–20]. We identified

nine SNPs within four genes (NR1I3, ABCC5, ABCB11,
SLCO1B1) potentially associated with GIS.
We first found a positive correlation between the
heterozygous genotype rs2501870 in the NR1I3 gene and
GIS. The NR1I3 gene encodes the constitutive androstane
receptor (CAR), which plays an essential and unique role
in both controlling the mammalian sulfation pathways and
facilitating bile acid (BA) detoxification and transport. The
NR1I3 rs2501870 is located in the 5′ region of the gene.
Despite the absence of expression and/or function analysis,
the presence of this SNP may result in the alteration of
mRNA secondary structure, potentially influencing the
transcription rate of NR1I3.

We also reported the association of the ABCC5
rs7636910 with GIS. The ABCC5 gene is a member of
the ATP-Binding-Cassette family expressed primarily in
the colon, liver, kidney and brain, and encodes the MRP5
protein implicated in the transport of cyclic nucleotides,
including cAMP and cGMP [21]. The ABCC5 rs7636910
does not change the glutamine at position 324 and so far
its role on protein function and expression has not been
elucidated. In addition we showed that four variants in
ABCB11 gene correlate with GIS. This gene encodes
for the bile salt export pump (BSEP), responsible
for hepatocyte-canaliculus export of conjugated and
unconjugated BAs. Reduced function of BSEP, caused

by inherited mutations or acquired factors, may lead to
progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and severe liver
disease [22]. BSEP expression is regulated by nuclear
receptors. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
the pregnance X receptor (PXR) down-regulate BSEP
expression while CAR and the farsenoid X receptor
(FXR) up-regulate BSEP expression [23]. It also been
shown that increased cAMP stimulates BSEP insertion
into canalicular membrane [24]. Noteworthy, a previous
study showed that ABCB11 overexpression in mice results
in BA hypersecretion [25]. The ABCB11 rs497692 results
associated with altered transport function, promoting
skipping of exon 24 and probably leading to dysfunction
of the hepatobiliary bile salt export pump [26]. This SNP
was previously associated with primary biliary cirrhosis,
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and benign recurrent
intrahepatic cholestasis [27–29]. The other ABCB11
variants (rs495714, rs496550 and rs473351) are located
in 3′ region of gene, including exon 28, but no clinical
association has been previously reported for these SNPs.
Finally, we found three SNPs (rs2291075,
rs2306283, rs11045819) in the SLCO1B1 gene potentially
associated with GIS. This gene encodes the organic
anion transporting polypeptide1B1 (OATP1B1), a Na+independent transporter expressed on the basolateral
membrane of human hepatocytes that mediates the hepatic
uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics,
such as estrogen conjugates, BAs and statins. In vitro
studies have shown that the rs2306283 and the rs2291075
are associated with reduced transport activity [30], while
the rs11045819 shows unchanged transport function
[31]. However, the strong LD between rs2306283 and
rs2291075 leads to hypothesize a non-independent effect
of the two SNPs. It has been reported that OATP1B1
expression is genotype-dependent and results higher
in livers homozygous for rs2306283, rs11045819 and
rs2291075. Moreover, livers that are heterozygous for
rs11045819 have higher OATP1B1 expression than the
wild-type, while the expression of OATP1B1 in livers
carrying a single allele of rs2291075 and rs2306283 is not
significantly different from the wild-type [32].
Patients with FD quite often report a previous
diagnosis of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder
[33, 34]. In approximately 25% to 50% of the patients
with IBS BAs induce diarrhea either through decreased
ileal reabsorption or increased hepatic synthesis [35,
36]. The enterohepatic circulation (EC) of BAs is a
physiological process mediated by a complex membrane
transport system in the liver and intestine, regulated
by nuclear receptors [37], as depicted in Figure 2. BAs
are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and are
transported into bile ducts in conjugated form. They
then accumulate and are stored in the gallbladder where
they flow into the duodenum following meal-stimulated
gallbladder contraction. After delivery into the intestinal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lumen, the vast majority are reabsorbed by the distal
ileum into the portal circulation and returned to the liver.
A disruption of EC can alter the BA pool with consequent
deregulation of the physiological process performed
by BAs such as digestion and absorption of nutrient in
the gut. The cause of BA diarrhea includes a deficiency
in fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), a hormone
produced in enterocytes in response to high intracellular
concentration of BAs and that inhibits hepatic BA
synthesis through the downregulation of the rate-limiting
enzyme cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) [38].
However, recent pharmacogenomics evidence suggests
that BA transporters are highly polymorphic leading to
variable expression and function in humans [39, 40], so
other potential causes of BA diarrhea can include genetic
variations that affect the proteins involved in BA EC and
synthesis. Theoretically, an excessive BA transport through
the hepatocyte decreases their intracellular concentration
and thus leading to enhanced BA biosynthesis; the
increasing BA efflux that exceeds the normal capacity for
ileal reabsorption can produce BA diarrhea.
In this study, we postulate that polymorphisms in
NR1I3, ABCC5, ABCB11 and SLCO1B1 are associated
with susceptibility to develop GIS in FD through an
hypothetic mechanism that affect EC of BAs. However,
further well-designed studies need to better investigate
this hypothesis including methods for the diagnosis of BA
diarrhea.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses
a pharmacogenomics approach to explore genetic factors
potentially involved in clinical manifestations in FD. Even
if the effects associated to the identified variants remain
to be investigated, our study is a hypothesis-generating
early work. Further investigations will be required to
better understand the role of these polymorphic variants
in the pathogenesis of FD and a validation study in an
independent FD patient group will be planned.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
49 patients (18 males; median age 40.3 years and
31 females; median age 39.4 years) from 18 families
were enrolled in this study between December 2012 to
April 2015 from the Department of Medical and Surgical
Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Magna Graecia University
of Catanzaro and from the Department of Nephrology,
University Federico II of Naples. All patients were
classically affected by FD and the diagnosis was confirmed
by enzyme and/or molecular genetic analyses. Among the
49 FD patients, 12 experienced GIS while 37 did not. The
mean age at diagnosis among FD patients with GIS was
31 years (range: 4–53), while among FD patients without
GIS was 34,9 years (range: 2–60).

Moreover, 37 patients were under ERT at the time of
enrolment in the study: 4 received infusions of agalsidase
beta every 2 weeks at a dose of 1 mg/kg, while 33 received
infusions of agalsidase alfa 0.2 mg/kg every other week, for
an average of 5 years and 2 months (range: 11 months −11
years and 4 months). Baseline features of our FD patients and
mutations are reported respectively in Table 3 and Table 4.
Laboratory and medical evaluations were
undertaken at baseline to exclude other possible causes

of GI complaints. All patients underwent clinical
evaluation, laboratory tests such as full blood cell count,
inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), coeliac screening
(antitransglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies)
including immunoglobulin levels, liver and kidney
biochemical profiles, stool tests for infection (stool culture,
examination for ova and parasites and for viral infection),
fecal calprotectin, urinalysis and culture; moreover
all patient underwent a trial with a lactose-free diet for

bars indicate down-regulation, while black arrows indicate transport across the cell. Proteins encoded by the four genes reported in the
current study associated with GIS are represented in orange boxes. BAs are synthesized in hepatocytes from cholesterol by CYP7A1
which is thought to be the rate limiting step in BA synthesis. BAs active FXR to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription. FXR induces intestinal
hormone FGF19 which is released in the portal circulation and in the hepatocytes activates FGFR4/Klotho-β signaling inhibiting CYP7A1
activity. In hepatocytes BSEP excretes monovalent BAs in the bile canaliculus while divalent BAs and anionic conjugates are excreted
via MRP2. MDR3 mediates secretion of phopholipids while organic cations are excreted via MDR1. Basolateral bile acid export system
(MRP1, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5) excretes accumulated biliary constituents. In the terminal ilieum BAs are reabsorbed by ASBT and effluxed
on the basolateral site via OSTα/β. BAs are taken up by the hepatocytes via NTCP and OATPs transport systems. BSEP expression is

concentrations were normalized to 60 ng/µl and
1 µl of each DNA samples was analyzed using
DMET plus arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara,
CA, US) according to the manufacturers’ indication
as previously described by Di Martino et al. [17].
Briefly, the DMET Plus assay (Affymetrix Inc., Santa
Clara, CA, US) uses Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP)
technology to amplify the sequence-specific targets
for each 1936 marker. The resulting target DNA were
then enzymatic fragmented, labeled and hybridized to
the arrays containing allele-specific oligonucleotides.
Finally the DMET Plus arrays were scanned with the
GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara,
CA, US) to obtain the intensity data by CEL files.
Genotypes were calculated by DMET Console software
version 1.1 using the Dynamic Genotype Boundaries
algorithm (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US).
Patients with a call rate less than 95% were excluded
from further analysis.

DMET results were validated using predesigned TaqMan® Genotyping Assays (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) provided in custom fast 96-well
plates, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For each patient, we genotyped the following SNPs:
rs2501870, rs7636910, rs2291075 and rs497692 (assay
ID: C_16033318_20; C_25474215_30; C_1901690_1
and C_8813572_30, respectively). Reactions were
performed in duplicate using an endpoint plate read on
ViiA7 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem).
Thermal Cycling conditions included an initial step
of denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40
cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. Allelic
discrimination was made using the SDS software
(Applied Biosystem) that plots Rn values (fluorescence
of the reporter dye divided by the fluorescence of a
passive reference dye) based on the fluorescence
signals from each well.

Statistical analysis
Genotypes for all SNPs were tested for deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using a χ2 test and
SNPs that were not in equilibrium (P < 0.05) were
excluded. By DMET-Analyzer Tool software [42] were
analyzed the genotype frequencies by two-tailed Fisher
exact test in two groups: FD patients with GIS versus
patients without GIS. Results of potential interest were
limited to those in which the p-value was ≤ 0.05. Odds
ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for 2 × 2 table using Med Calc
v12.3.0. No correction for multiple comparisons was
performed.
