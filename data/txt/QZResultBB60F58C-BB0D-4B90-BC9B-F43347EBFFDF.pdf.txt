ABSTRACT
Cellular viability is usually determined by measuring the capacity of cells to
exclude vital dyes such as 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), or by assessing
nuclear morphology with chromatinophilic plasma membrane-permeant dyes, such
as Hoechst 33342. However, a fraction of cells that exclude DAPI or exhibit normal
nuclear morphology have already lost mitochondrial functions and/or manifest
massive activation of apoptotic caspases, and hence are irremediably committed
to death. Here, we developed a protocol for the simultaneous detection of plasma
membrane integrity (based on DAPI) or nuclear morphology (based on Hoechst
33342), mitochondrial functions (based on the mitochondrial transmembrane
potential probe DiOC6(3)) and caspase activation (based on YO-PRO®-3, which can
enter cells exclusively upon the caspase-mediated activation of pannexin 1 channels).
This method, which allows for the precise quantification of dead, dying and healthy
cells, can be implemented on epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry platforms
and is compatible with a robotized, high-throughput workflow.

of soluble mediators), for very long periods [5, 6]. Other,
more accurate definitions of cell death should therefore be
employed. Recently, a large committee of experts in the field
agreed on pragmatically identifying the transition between a
reversible perturbation of cellular homeostasis and cell death
(which is irreversible, by definition) with the permanent
loss of plasma membrane integrity [7]. This process can
be conveniently monitored by the uptake of so-called
exclusion dyes, i.e., colored or fluorescent molecules that
are excluded by healthy cells owing to the integrity of their
plasma membrane [2, 8]. A commonly employed exclusion
dye is 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) [8].
However, plasma membrane permeabilization is a late
process in the cascade of biochemical events that bridges the

INTRODUCTION
Although the molecular mechanisms that are involved
in the regulation and execution of cell death have been studied
extensively during the last decades, the definition of cell death
itself is still a matter of debate [1, 2]. It has been proposed
that the demise of proliferating cells corresponds to the loss
of their clonogenic potential [3]. However, this definition
cannot be extended to post-mitotic cells (e.g., neurons
and cardiomyocytes), which definitively exited the cell
cycle along with terminal differentiation [4], and is rather
inaccurate, as proliferating cells can enter a temporary or
irreversible cell cycle arrest (and hence fail to replicate), while
maintaining biological functions (for instance the secretion

delivery of a lethal stimulus to the execution of cell death [7, 9].
This implies that, at least in some instances, other processes
well upstream of plasma membrane permeabilization may
irreversibly commit cells to die, including the complete loss of
mitochondrial functions [10–12], and the massive activation
of cysteine proteases of the caspase family [13, 14]. Thus,
although plasma membrane permeabilization constitutes the
gold standard indicator of cell death, at least in vitro, there
are many experimental settings in which it is important to
quantify the proportion of cells that still possess an intact
plasma membrane yet are doomed to die.
Mitochondrial functions are usually monitored
by means of cationic lipophilic fluorochromes that
accumulate within the mitochondrial matrix driven by
the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆ψm), such
as 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) or
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) [15] At odds with
their functional counterparts, dysfunctional mitochondria
exhibit indeed a reduced ∆ψm, resulting in an impaired
accumulation of these probes [16–18]. One economic way
of monitoring caspase activation relies on YO-PRO®-3, a
fluorochome that accumulates in the nucleus upon crossing
the plasma membrane through pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels
[19–21]. PANX1 channels are activated by caspase-3
before the onset of plasma membrane permeabilization,
a setting in which cells do not take up vital dyes yet, but
secrete small metabolites (such as ATP) and accumulate
YO-PRO®-3 [22–24]. Of note, cells with permeabilized
plasma membrane may exhibit profound nuclear alterations,
including chromatin condensation and shrinkage (which
are associated with apoptosis) or nuclear dilation (which is
associated with necrosis). These changes can be monitored
by epifluorescence microscopy using a plasma-membrane
chromatinophilic dye such as Hoechst 33342 [2, 8].
Based on these premises, we decided to combine an
exclusion dye (DAPI) or a dye for monitoring nuclear integrity
(Hoechst 33342) (both of which emit a blue fluorescence)
with DiOC6(3) (which emits a green fluorescence) and
YO-PRO®-3 (which emits a red/orange fluorescence) to
monitor the evolution of cells exposed to lethal stimuli. Here,
we demonstrate that such a co-staining approach allows for
monitoring the absolute number and percentage of truly
viable cells (which exhibit an intact plasma membrane with
closed PANX1 channels and high ∆ψm). This procedure
is compatible with a fully robotized workflow in which
cellular samples are processed, stained and analyzed by
epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.

maintained human non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) A549 cells in control conditions or we
exposed them to a lethal dose of the multikinase inhibitor
staurosporine (a well-known inducer of apoptosis) [25]
or the platinum derivative oxaliplatin [26, 27] for 24 hrs.
Thereafter, we simultaneously stained cells with Hoechst
33342, DiOC6(3) and YO-PRO®-3 and analyzed them
by epifluorescence microscopy. Upon automated image
segmentation (Supplementary Figure 1), we identified five
possible cellular phenotypes: (1) cells that stained weakly
for Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst 33342dim cells, manifesting
normal nuclear morphology) and negatively for
YO- PRO®-3 (and hence retained normal plasma membrane
impermeability) while exhibiting a high DiOC6(3) signal
(preserving a high ∆ψm); (2) cells that stained intensely for
both Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst 33342bright cells, manifesting
nuclear condensation) and YO-PRO®-3 (manifesting a
complete loss of plasma membrane barrier functions)
while exhibiting a low DiOC6(3) signal (a sign of complete
impairment of mitochondrial functions); and (3–5) Hoechst
33342dim cells bearing either YO-PRO®-3 positivity or low
DiOC6(3) signal, or both (three intermediate situations)
(Figure 1A). In control conditions, most cells exhibited
a uniform Hoechst 33342dimDiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3−
phenotype (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 2), a
staining profile that clearly changed in response to cell
death induction. Exposing A549 cells to 500 μM oxaliplatin
or 4 μM staurosporine for 24 hrs, indeed, provoked an
increase in the frequency of Hoechst 33342bright cells as
well as of Hoechst 33342dimDiOC6(3)lowYO-PRO®-3+,
Hoechst 33342dimDiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3+ or Hoechst
33342dimDiOC6(3)lowYO-PRO®-3− cells as it reduced
the frequency and absolute number of healthy Hoechst
33342dimDiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3− cells (Figure 1C, 1D and
Supplementary Figure 2).

Implementation of the triple straining procedure
on flow cytometry
Next, we implemented the triple staining protocol
described above on a cytofluorometric platform amenable
to automation. To this aim, human NSCLC A549 cells
maintained in control conditions or exposed to lethal
stimuli for 24 hrs were collected and then co-stained
with DAPI, DiOC6(3) and YO-PRO®-3. The vast majority
of untreated A549 cells exhibited a DAPI−DiOC6(3)high
YO-PRO®-3− phenotype, indicating intact plasma
membranes, normal mitochondrial functions and no
caspase activation (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure 3). In contrast, exposing A549 cells to 500 μM
oxaliplatin or 4 μM staurosporine for 24 hrs caused the
accumulation of DAPI+ cells, as well as of cells exhibiting
a DAPI−DiOC6(3)lowYO-PRO®-3+, DAPI−DiOC6(3)highYOPRO®-3+ or DAPI−DiOC6(3)low YO-PRO®-3− staining
pattern (Figure 2B, 2C and Supplementary Figure  3).
Hence, both oxaliplatin and staurosporine cause a drop in

(Figure 4B). Importantly, these results were obtained by
means of a completely automated workflow that did not
require any manual intervention.

Concluding remarks
Here, we describe a straightforward workflow that
allows for the accurate and automatable quantification of
living cells based on several parameters, namely, plasma
membrane integrity, PANX1 channel impermeability and
normal ∆ψm. The protocol that has been developed to this aim
is robust (reagents are not particularly prone to degradation
or sensitive to unpredictable environmental conditions),
simple (it does not involve washing steps), rapid (staining
time = 30 min), can be readily scaled up (as shown for
96-well plates) and is adaptable to different readouts (as
shown for epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry).
This implies that our protocol can be implemented on virtually
any robotized platform that allows for automatic pipetting (for
trypsinization and staining) and incubation, and is coupled
to any reader (be it an epifluorescence microscope or a flow
cytometer) that can automatically handle multi-well plates.
One advantage of modern microscopic and
cytofluorometric systems is that they are compatible with
the quantification of the absolute number of cells per area
or volume. Thus, the staining protocol described here
allows for the precise discrimination of live, dead and
dying cells in a variety of experimental samples, including

Detection of synergistic interactions by
automatic viability measurements
To further investigate the utility of our fully
automated viability test, we measured its performance on
the pharmacological interaction between another platinum
derivative, i.e., cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP,
best known as cisplatin) and the poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor PJ-34 hydrochloride
hydrate (hereafter referred to as PJ-34) [28, 29]. CDDP
reduced the number of DAPI−DiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3−
(viable) A549 cells at much lower concentrations than did
PJ-34 (Figure 4A). Moreover, at certain concentrations,
CDDP and PJ-34 exhibited a synergistic interaction,
meaning that their co-administration reduced the number
of DAPI−DiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3− A549 cells in a
hyperadditive fashion, and hence was much more effective
than the administration of either the two agents alone

A549 cells were left untreated or treated with the indicated concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP) or PJ-34 for 48 hrs, then stained with DAPI,
DiOC6(3) and YO-PRO®-3 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Panel A reports quantitative data on DAPI−DiOC6(3)highYO-PRO®-3− (viable)

before acquisition. Cytofluorometric acquisitions were
performed on a CyanADP or a MACSQuant cytometer
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For
epifluorescence microscopy, supernatants were removed
and cells were incubated in 30 μL of medium supplemented
with 40 nM DiOC6(3), 1 μM YO-PRO®-3 iodide and 2 μM
Hoechst 33342 for 30 min at 37°C before acquisition.
Images were acquired on ImageXpress Micro XL automated
microscopes (4 view fields per well).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and cell cultures

Data processing and statistical analyses

Except otherwise indicated, cell culture media and
supplements were obtained from Gibco-Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA, USA), chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA), and plasticware from Greiner
Bio-One (Monroe, CA, USA). Human non-small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) A549 cells were cultured in
Glutamax®-containing DMEM/F12 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and 10 mM HEPES
buffer. Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator
generating a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Unless otherwise specified, experiments were
performed in quadruplicate parallel instances, and data were
analyzed with the R software (http://www.r-project.org/).
The first-line flow cytometry data analysis was performed
using the flowcore package for R (http://www.bioconductor.
org) upon gating on events with normal forward and side
scatter parameters. Microscopy images were analyzed by
means of the MetaXpress (Molecular Devices) software. In
particular, images were segmented using the built-in custom
module editor to identify nuclei (based on Hoechst 33342
fluorescence), and cytoplasmic regions (based on DiOC6(3)
fluorescence). Thereafter, the average nuclear signal of
Hoechst 33342 and YO-PRO®-3 as well as the average
cytoplasmic signal of DiOC6(3) were measured. The
pharmacological interaction between PJ-34 and CDDP was
evaluated computing combination indexes (CI) following
Harbron’s method [30, 31]. Unless otherwise specified, data
are presented as means ± SD. Statistical significance was
assessed with two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-tests.

Automated experimental workflow
All experimental steps were conducted on the
PACRI HTS cell biology platform that integrates a Biomek
FXP automated liquid handling workstation (Beckman–
Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA), a multidrop combi
automated dispenser (ThermoScientific, Whaltam, MA,
USA), a Cytomat6000 automated cell culture incubator
(ThermoScientific), 3 ImageXpress Micro XL automated
microscopes (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), a
CyAn ADP cytofluorometer (Beckman–Coulter), a Hypercyt
loader (Intellicyt, Albuquerque, NM, USA) and a Motoman
HP3JC industrial robot (Motoman, West Carrollton, OH,
USA). A fully automated workflow entailing cell culture,
drug treatment, sample preparation and cytofluorometric
or microscopic acquisition was generated by means of the
SAMI automation control software (Beckman–Coulter).
Multiplex assays were prepared in parallel for microscopic
and cytofluorometric acquisition.

Cell death assays
Five × 103 human NSCLC A549 cells were seeded
in 96-well clear cell culture plates or black imaging plates
for flow cytometry- or epifluorescence microscopybased assays, respectively. Cells were allowed to adapt
for 24 hrs and then maintained in control conditions
or exposed to lethal stimuli for 24 or 48 hrs. For flow
cytometry, culture supernatants were discarded and cells
were detached with 30 μL TrypLE™ Express per well,
then resuspended in 30 μL of medium supplemented with
40 nM DiOC6(3), 1 μM YO-PRO®-3 iodide and 2 μM DAPI
(all from Molecular Probes®−Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
