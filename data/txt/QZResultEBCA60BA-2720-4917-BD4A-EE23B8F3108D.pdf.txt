BACKGROUND: Patient outcomes following resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) after second-line chemotherapy regimen is unknown. METHODS: From August 1998 to June 2009, data from 1099 patients with CLM were
collected prospectively. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients who underwent resection of CLM after
second-line (2 or more) chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: Sixty patients underwent resection of CLM after 2 or
more chemotherapy regimens. Patients had advanced CLM (mean number of CLM  standard deviation, 4  3.5;
mean maximum size of CLM, 5  3.2 cm) and had received 17  8 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. In 54 (90%)
patients, the switch from the first regimen to another regimen was motivated by tumor progression or suboptimal radiographic response. All patients received irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and the majority (42/60 [70%]) received a monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab or cetuximab) as part of the last preoperative regimen. Postoperative morbidity and
mortality rates were 33% and 3%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 32 months, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall
survival rates were 83%, 41%, and 22%, respectively. Median chemotherapy-free survival after resection or completion
of additional chemotherapy administered after resection was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 4-14 months). Synchronous (vs metachronous) CLM and minor (vs major) pathologic response were independently associated with
worse survival. CONCLUSIONS: Resection of CLM after a second-line chemotherapy regimen was found to be safe
and was associated with a modest hope for definitive cure. This approach represents a viable option in patients with

KEYWORDS: colorectal liver metastases, liver resection, second-line chemotherapy, outcome.

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide and was responsible for an estimated
49,920 deaths in 2009 in the United States.1 In most cases, death occurs at the end of the evolution of metastatic disease,
and in the majority of patients, the liver is the first site of metastasis. In patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM),
liver resection is the only treatment associated with long-term survival. In patients with unresectable CLM, chemotherapy
is the only therapy with a proven survival benefit, and resection may be possible in case of good response to chemotherapy.2 In patients with resectable CLM, preoperative systemic chemotherapy has been used as part of the treatment strategy
to decrease the risk of recurrence after resection.3 Disease progression during preoperative chemotherapy predicts poor
outcome after resection.4 For patients with advanced disease and progression during preoperative chemotherapy, a change
to an alternate chemotherapy regimen is usually recommended, and liver resection may be reconsidered if there is disease
response or stabilization in response to the alternative chemotherapy.5 However, objective response rates to second-line
preoperative chemotherapy are only 4%-28%, hence surgery is rarely an option after failure of first-line chemotherapy.6-10
Furthermore, the safety, efficacy, and outcome of hepatic surgery in patients who received multiple lines of chemotherapy
have been evaluated only in small series of patients who received cetuximab or intra-arterial hepatic artery chemotherapy
infusion as a ‘‘rescue’’ regimen.11-13

CLM Resection After Second-Line Chemotherapy/Brouquet et al

In this study, we analyzed the feasibility and outcomes of resection of CLM after a second-line chemotherapy regimen. We aimed to determine the role of liver
surgery in patients with advanced metastatic disease who
received multiple lines of chemotherapy because of suboptimal response or toxicity after first-line chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Definitions
Between August 13, 1998, and June, 17, 2009, data from
1099 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for CLM at 1 institution were collected prospectively.
Inclusion criteria for this study were resection of CLM following second-line (2 or more) chemotherapy regimens
and at least 1 year of follow-up after surgery. The study
was approved by the institutional review board of The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(RCR01-116).
Preoperative Chemotherapy
At The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
the institutional guidelines for patients with CLM include
preoperative chemotherapy in almost all patients.5 Exceptions to this practice are patients who develop CLM less
than 1 year after adjuvant chemotherapy for the primary
tumor and patients with small volume CLM at risk of disappearing during chemotherapy and that cannot have
their position radiographically labeled by a fiducial
marker.14,15 In patients with initially resectable CLM,
preoperative short-course chemotherapy (8-12 weeks) is
used. Patients with advanced CLM initially unsuitable for
resection are seen by the surgeon prior to initiation of
chemotherapy to determine whether the patient may be a
surgical candidate with a chemosensitive tumor (radiographic response to chemotherapy). In patients with initially unresectable disease, surgical resection is considered
as soon as the lesions become resectable.5 During treatment, restaging is performed every 3 to 4 cycles on the basis of clinical assessment and imaging. For this study,
imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed for each
patient to measure response according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)16
(response defined as complete response, partial response,
stable, or progressive disease) and morphologic criteria17
(response defined as none, incomplete, or optimal
response). Second-line chemotherapy was defined as any
change in chemotherapy regimen administered for CLM
except for the discontinuation of bevacizumab 6-8 weeks

before surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy administered for
the primary tumor was not considered first-line chemotherapy for CLM except in patients with CLM detected at
the same time as the primary tumor (synchronous CLM)
and patients who developed CLM during adjuvant chemotherapy for the primary tumor. Reasons for receiving second-line chemotherapy were classified into the following
categories: (1) progression during first-line chemotherapy,
(2) advanced metastases with suboptimal response to the
first-line chemotherapy regimen, or (3) intolerable toxicity of the first-line chemotherapy regimen. A suboptimal
response was defined as a response insufficient to allow
safe resection based on volumetric assessment.
Surgical Procedure, Postoperative
Complications, and Pathologic Findings
Liver resections were performed only with curative
intent—that is, only if it was believed that a complete
tumor resection could be achieved. During laparotomy,
the peritoneal cavity was inspected to rule out extrahepatic
spread of disease. Hepatic palpation and intraoperative
ultrasonography were performed in all cases to better
define the location of the CLM in the liver and their relationship to portal pedicles and hepatic veins. Major hepatectomy was defined as hepatic resection including 3 or
more contiguous liver segments. Radiofrequency ablation
was used in combination with liver resection and only for
small tumors in selected patients when a complete resection with staged resections and portal vein embolization
were not otherwise possible. Data on postoperative morbidity and 90-day mortality were collected prospectively.
The severity of postoperative complications was graded
using the classification of Dindo et al.18 Complete pathologic response was defined as 0% of tumor cells viable,
major pathologic response as 1%-49% of tumor cells viable, and minor pathologic response as 50% or more of tumor cells viable.19 Changes of the nontumorous liver
parenchyma, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(steatosis and steatohepatitis) and sinusoidal dilation,
were assessed semiquantitatively as described previously.20-22 Hepatic injury was defined as steatosis in more
than 30% of the hepatocytes and/or the presence of steatohepatitis (Kleiner score >4) and/or moderate or severe
sinusoidal dilation.
Long-Term Outcome
The decision whether to deliver additional chemotherapy
after resection was made at the time of the follow-up postoperative visit on an individualized basis, based on the

presence of possible residual disease, response to preoperative chemotherapy on imaging,16,17 tolerance and number
of cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, and pathologic
response. The policy was to avoid chemotherapy after resection when possible, because most patients who undergo
resection of CLM have already received prolonged chemotherapy. Patients were reassessed via physical examination,
carcinoembryonic antigen serum measurement, and multiphase (liver protocol) computed tomography examination
every 3-4 months after resection, and decisions about
further treatment were made according to the findings on
follow-up workup.
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative and qualitative variables were expressed as
mean  standard deviation, median (range), and frequency.
Overall and disease-free survival were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method from the date of resection of CLM
and compared using a log-rank test. Chemotherapy-free survival was calculated from the date of resection of CLM in
patients who did not receive postoperative chemotherapy
and from the date of last dose of postoperative chemotherapy in those who did receive postoperative chemotherapy.
For the detection of factors associated with survival
after resection of CLM following second-line chemotherapy regimen, univariate analysis was used to examine the
relationship between overall survival and the following
clinicopathologic variables: rectal (vs other) location of
the primary tumor, presence of regional lymph node metastases (v absence), synchronous (vs metachronous)
CLM, multiple (vs single) CLM (greater than 2), size of
CLM measured at the time of diagnosis (greater or less
than 5 cm), presence of extrahepatic disease, preoperative
serum CEA level >5 ng/dL, progression of disease during
first-line chemotherapy, intolerable toxic effects during
first-line chemotherapy, total number of cycles of chemotherapy, number of cycles of the last chemotherapy regimen, partial or stable disease after last chemotherapy
regimen according to RECIST criteria, morphologic
response after last chemotherapy regimen, occurrence of
major postoperative complications, pathologic response
(complete or major vs minor), and postoperative chemotherapy. All variables associated with survival with P < .2
in univariate proportional hazards model were subsequently entered into a Cox multivariate regression model
with backward elimination. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Comparisons between groups were analyzed via chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test for proportions,
Mann-Whitney U test for medians, and Student t test for

using SPSS version 17.2 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Among the 1099 patients who underwent resection of
CLM during the study period, 230 did not receive any preoperative chemotherapy, and 809 received only 1 line of
preoperative chemotherapy before surgery. The remaining
60 (5%) patients received 2 or more lines of preoperative
chemotherapy and were the subjects of our study. The
number of patients who underwent resection of CLM after
a second-line chemotherapy increased over time (Figure 1).
The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
The majority (38/60 [63%]) of patients had synchronous
and multiple CLM. Twelve (20%) patients had at least 5
CLM, and 25 (42%) patients had CLM measuring at least
5 cm in diameter. The 13 patients who had metachronous
CLM had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy for
node-positive primary tumors (5-fluorouracil and levamisole in 8 patients, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in 5
patients). The median time between the last cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy and the detection of CLM in these 13
patients was 28 months (range, 4-90 months). Fourteen
(23%) patients had extrahepatic disease, including 8
patients with resectable lung metastases, 5 patients with
portal node involvement, and 1 patient with pelvic local
recurrence of rectal cancer.
Preoperative Chemotherapy
Characteristics of preoperative chemotherapy are detailed
in Table 2. Most patients received oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment. In most

cases, the reason for a switch to a different chemotherapy
regimen was tumor progression or advanced disease with
insufficient response. In all patients, the last chemotherapy regimen before resection included irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and in the majority, it was associated with either
cetuximab or bevacizumab. Most patients (39/60 [60%])
had prolonged chemotherapy (more than 6 months or
12 cycles). Twenty-two (37%) patients had objective
response (complete or partial tumor response) with the
last preoperative chemotherapy regimen according to the
RECIST criteria, and 16 (27%) patients had an optimal
morphologic response to the last preoperative chemotherapy regimen.

Long-Term Outcomes and Postoperative
Chemotherapy
After a median follow-up time of 32 months, 1-year, 3-year,
and 5-year overall survival rates were 83%, 41%, and 22%,
respectively, and 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year disease-free survival were 37%, 11%, and 11%, respectively (Figure 2).
Twenty-six (43%) patients received postoperative
chemotherapy. Forty-nine (81%) patients experienced recurrence, and palliative chemotherapy was restarted in all
of them. Among these patients, 8 underwent surgery
(resection of lung metastases in 5 patients; repeat liver
resection in 2 patients; resection of local recurrence of
rectal cancer in 1 patient). Median chemotherapy-free survival time was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval, 4-14
months) after surgery or after the end of postoperative
chemotherapy (Figure 3). In the 34 patients who did not
receive postoperative chemotherapy, the median chemotherapy-free survival time was 12 months (95% confidence
interval, 6-18 months). Eight patients were alive and free of
disease 12 months after resection (Figure 4).
Predictors of Survival After Resection of CLM
After Second-Line Chemotherapy Regimen
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis for factors
associated with survival after resection of CLM after secondline chemotherapy regimen are summarized in Table 3.
Univariate analysis showed that synchronous CLM, multiple CLM, absence of radiographic response or stability
of CLM by RECIST, and minor pathologic response were
associated with worse survival. On multivariate analysis,
only synchronous CLM and minor pathologic response

were independent factors of worse survival (Figure 5).
The 5-year survival rate was 10% in patients with both
factors, compared with 32% in patients with neither factor (P < .001).

DISCUSSION
Our study shows that hepatectomy for CLM after a second-line chemotherapy regimen is feasible and associated
with a modest survival benefit in patients who present
with advanced CLM and have a suboptimal response to
systemic therapy. Although oncologic outcomes seen in
this series are not as good as previously reported after
resection of CLM after first-line chemotherapy, resection
of CLM after second-line chemotherapy regimen can be
associated with prolonged survival and a chemotherapyfree interval and therefore represents a reasonable alternative in patients with advanced CLM.
To our knowledge, this is the largest series evaluating outcome of patients undergoing resection of CLM
after second-line chemotherapy regimen. We found
1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of 83% and 41%,
respectively, and 1-year and 3-year disease-free survival
rates of 37% and 11%, respectively. The 1-year overall
survival rate reported in this study compares favorably to
the 1-year survival rates of 28%-40% reported previously
in small series of patients treated with cetuximab or intraarterial hepatic artery chemotherapy infusion as secondline therapy.11,13,23 This approach was associated with a
median chemotherapy-free interval of 9 months after liver
resection or after completion of additional chemotherapy

administered after resection. We believe this represents an alternative to maintenance chemotherapy in patients with
advanced disease in addition to modest possible survival
benefit.
Over the past decade, the oncosurgical strategy of
combining effective preoperative chemotherapy with an
aggressive surgical approach has received wide acceptance
for the treatment of CLM.2,3,19 In addition to lowering
recurrence rates after resection,3 preoperative chemotherapy guides the treatment strategy, because tumor response
to preoperative chemotherapy represents a powerful prognostic factor in patients undergoing resection.17,19 Tumor
progression during chemotherapy is considered a contraindication to resection of CLM by most oncologic teams.4
In patients who experience disease progression or develop
severe toxic effects during first-line chemotherapy, a second-line regimen is usually introduced. Although this

Cancer

approach has been shown to improve survival, reported
radiographic response rates after second-line chemotherapy are only 4%-28%.6-10 Our finding of a 37% objective
radiographic response rate is consistent with rates reported
by others, illustrating the difficulty in obtaining a tumor
response with second-line chemotherapy. The extent of
the disease probably contributes to the 20% positive margins after resection in our population. However, this rate
remains acceptable with regard to previously reported
data in patients with advanced colorectal liver metastases
that can be up to 46%.24 Recently, yttrium 90 microsphere hepatic artery radioembolization has been proposed as an alternative to second-line chemotherapy as it
has been shown to improve survival compared to intravenous fluorouracil in patients with unresectable CLM
refractory to therapy.25 However, with yttrium 90 radioembolization, the radiographic tumor response rate rarely

exceeds 10%, and the median survival rarely exceeds
1 year.
The majority of patients in our series had disease
progression or a suboptimal response following first-line
chemotherapy. Interestingly, patients with progression
during first-line systemic therapy did not appear to have a
worse outcome than patients who were switched to a second regimen because of inadequate response or toxic
effects. We identified synchronous metastases and pathologic response as prognostic factors in our patients and
found that the combination of these 2 factors adversely
affected survival (10% 5-year overall survival rate when
the 2 factors were present). The low rate of major or complete pathologic response (32%) in this study compared
with data reported previously using modern first-line
chemotherapy (45%-58%) probably reflects unfavorable
tumor biology. Although the type of regimen, the duration of chemotherapy, and the use of a monoclonal antibody in first-line or last chemotherapy regimen was not
associated with prognosis, we believe that the administration of a monoclonal antibody (e.g., bevacizumab or
cetuximab) as second-line therapy when it was not
given as first-line therapy may be an option, because it is
associated with improved radiographic response rate or
survival in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal
cancer.11,19,26,27 Other recommendations to optimize
treatment strategy in these patients receiving second-line

chemotherapy for CLM might focus on the timing of surgery that should be proposed as soon as the disease is
resectable.
This study has some limitations. Study inclusion
was not based on the extent of the disease, because the definition of resectability is often controversial,27 but on
treatment with second-line preoperative chemotherapy
regimens and subsequent liver resection with curative
intention. Not all patients received the same chemotherapy regimens before surgery, and we did not analyze
patients with advanced CLM who received second-line
chemotherapy regimen and did not undergo resection. It
was a retrospective review of data acquired prospectively
and thus suffers from the limitations of retrospective
studies, including potential selection bias. However, we
believe that a phase 2 or 3 trial would be impractical to
address this question. The comparison with a nonresected group was not performed, because resectable
CLM remain a surgical indication, and progression during chemotherapy a relative contraindication to resection. It was not possible to select a population of patients
receiving chemotherapy only with comparable disease
extent.
In conclusion, this study showed that resection of
CLM following second-line chemotherapy regimen is feasible and may be associated with a modest survival benefit.
Given the lack of highly effective treatment options for

patients with liver only metastatic disease with suboptimal
response to initial chemotherapy, we consider liver resection for selected patients following second-line therapy an
appropriate alternative. Not all patients receiving second-line chemotherapy for advanced CLM can benefit
from resection, however; in the future, refinements in
the assessment of tumor response should help to select
surgical candidates in this challenging therapeutic
setting.17,28,29
