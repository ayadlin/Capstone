Abstract

Author Manuscript

Erythropoietin (Epo) is widely used clinically to treat anemia associated with various clinical
conditions including cancer. Data from several clinical trials suggest significant adverse effect of
Epo treatment on cancer patient survival. However, controversy exists whether erythropoietin
receptor (EpoR) is functional in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that EpoR mRNA
expression was detectable in 90.1% of 65 melanoma cell lines, and increased copy number of the
Epo and EpoR loci occurred in 30% and 24.6% of 130 primary melanomas, respectively. EpoR
knockdown in melanoma cells resulted in diminished ERK phosphorylation in response to Epo
stimulation, decreased cell proliferation, and increased response to the inhibitory effect of hypoxia
and cisplatin in vitro. EpoR knockdown significantly decreased melanoma xenograft size and
tumor invasion in vivo. On the contrary, constitutive activation of EpoR activated cell proliferation
pathways in melanoma cells and resulted in increased cell proliferation and resistance to hypoxia
and cisplatin treatment in vitro. EpoR activation resulted in significantly larger xenografts with
increased tumor invasion of surrounding tissue in vivo. Daily administration of recombinant Epo
fails to stimulate melanoma growth in vivo, but the treatment increased vascular size in the
xenografts. Increased local recurrence after excision of the primary tumors was observed after Epo
treatment. Epo induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plug assays, and neutralization of Epo secreted
by melanoma cells results in decreased angiogenesis. These data support that EpoR is functional in

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Erythropoietin (Epo) regulates erythropoiesis by binding to its transmembrane receptor
(EpoR) (Wu et al. 1995). EpoR activation in hematopoietic cells results in the
phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 and activation of ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathways (Constantinescu et al. 1999). The recombinant forms of Epo are widely used to
treat anemia associated with various clinical conditions including cancer (Arcasoy 2008).
Recent randomized clinical trials in patients with breast (Leyland-Jones et al. 2005) and
head and neck cancer (Henke et al. 2003) unexpectedly reported that Epo treatment
decreased patients survival and accelerated tumor progression. Following the reports of the
results of three additional phase III studies and a phase II trial, all suggesting a statistically
significant adverse effect of Epo treatment on survival (Blau 2007), a “black box warning”
was issued for Epo products by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
While some of these studies have been criticized based on inadequate study design and lack
of rigorous controls (Jelkmann et al. 2008). A meta-analysis of 57 studies did not find a
survival benefit of patients receiving Epo or darbepoetin, but raised the possibility of a
negative impact on survival (Bohlius et al. 2009). A more recent meta-analysis of more than
10,000 cancer patients confirmed decreased overall survival in patients treated with Epo
(Bennett et al. 2008).

Author Manuscript

The effects of Epo on non-hematopoietic normal and cancerous tissues are still poorly
understood (Noguchi et al. 2008). Previous studies have shown that EpoR expression is not
restricted to hematopoietic cells but rather, it is also expressed in a variety of other cell types
such as embryonic neural crest progenitor cells and their derivatives (Knabe et al. 2005; Tsai
et al. 2006), neurons, glial cells, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes (Arcasoy 2008;
Okazaki et al. 2008; Tovari et al. 2008; Wright et al. 2004). We and others have previously
shown that a variety of cancer cells, including carcinomas of ovary, breast, lung, thyroid,
prostate, endometrium, cervix, head and neck (squamous), renal cell carcinoma, glioma, and
melanoma, express EpoR mRNA transcripts and protein(Acs et al. 2001; Acs et al. 2004b;
Arcasoy et al. 2002; Arcasoy et al. 2003; Arcasoy et al. 2005; Jeong et al. 2009; Lai et al.
2005; Yates et al. 2006). A number of studies suggested that Epo/EpoR may play a role in
tumor progression (Acs et al. 2004a; Hardee et al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2005; Mohyeldin et al.
2005) whereas other reports contradicted these findings (Belda-Iniesta et al. 2007;
LaMontagne et al. 2006) and thus, the role of Epo/EpoR during tumor progression is still
controversial.
The current study shows for the first time that increased copy number of the Epo and EpoR
loci occurs in surprisingly high percentage of primary melanomas; EpoR is functional in a

series of in vitro and in vivo assays. These data suggest that EpoR activation may contribute
to melanoma progression.

Results
Genomic alterations in Epo and EpoR in melanoma

Author Manuscript

We have previous shown that melanoma express Epo and EpoR (Kumar et al. 2005; Paragh
et al. 2009). To study whether genomic changes could drive increased Epo and/or EpoR
expression, we first determined the expression and DNA copy number status of Epo and
EpoR in early passage melanoma cell lines and human foreskin melanocytes using gene
expression profiling and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. EpoR
gene expression was detectable in 59/65 melanoma cell lines (90.1%). While no copy
number increases of EpoR were found in any of 47 cell lines analyzed by SNP, gain of Epo
was identified in 5/47 melanoma cells lines.
To correlate the results from cell lines with primary melanomas, we analyzed array CGH
(aCGH) data obtained from 130 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of
primary invasive melanomas. A detail breakdown of these cases is shown in Supplemental
Figure 1. 39 samples (30%) showed gain of the Epo region on chromosome 7p22 and 32
samples (24.6%) had copy number increases at the EpoR region on chromosome 19p13.3p13.2. 59 cases (45.4%) showed either Epo or EpoR gain and 12 cases (9.2%) showed
simultaneous gain of both regions (Table 1). Genomic amplification of the Epo gene was
seen in 1 case. The majority of melanomas with Epo or EpoR copy number increases were
from acral or mucosal sites (Supplemental Table 1). These data indicate that Epo and EpoR
region genomic gain is common in primary melanomas.

Effects of EpoR knockdown in vitro

Author Manuscript

Three different human melanoma cells lines from different stages, including WM35 (radial
growth phase, RGP), WM793 (vertical growth phase, VGP) and 1205Lu (metastatic
melanoma), were transfected with EpoR shRNA and selected for stable expression clones
(WM35EpoRkd, WM793EpoRkd, 1205LuEpoRkd). Respective melanoma cell lines transfected
with empty plasmids were used as controls. EpoR knockdown was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 1A) and western blotting (Figure 1B) using a goat anti-EpoR
(N-terminal portion of the protein) antibody. This antibody has been shown to be specific for
human EpoR (LaMontagne et al. 2006; Paragh et al. 2009). To confirm the specificity of
EpoR knockdown, we also used commercially available EpoR siRNA (Qiagen Hs EpoR 5
Cat No: S102780351) for transient EpoR knockdown. EpoR knockdown was verified by
western blot (supplementary Figure 1A) and quantitative PCR (supplementary Figure 1B).
We previously showed that Epo stimulates ERK phosphorylation in melanoma cells (Kumar
et al. 2005). To confirm the biological effect of EpoR knockdown on ERK phosphorylation,
we treated control and WM793EpoRkd with Epo and showed that Epo induced
phosphorylation of ERK was significantly decreased in EpoR knockdown cells (Figure 1C).
To avoid the influence of mutant BRAFV600E in the ERK phosphorylation assay, we used
EpoR siRNA for transient transfection in WM3211 melanoma cells which have wild type
BRAF and NRAS proteins. EpoR knockdown by siRNA also resulted in significantly

diminished phosphorylation of ERK in response to Epo (Figure 1D). The basal phosphoERK level was also decreased in EpoR knockdown cells suggesting that endogenous EpoR
may regulate basal ERK activation in the absence of Epo stimulation (Figure 1C and Figure
1D).
Using a Matrigel migration assay, we found that the migration capacity of melanoma cells
increased from WM35 to 1205Lu, whereas EpoR knockdown significantly decreased the
migration capacity of the most aggressive cell line 1205Lu (Figure 1E), similar to the effect
of EpoR in other cancers (Fu et al. 2009; Mohyeldin et al. 2005). We found that
WM35EpoRkd and WM793EpoRkd cell exhibited significantly decreased growth rate
compared to control cells under normoxic conditions, while no significant change was
observed in 1205LuEpoRkd during the 4-day culture period (Figure 1F). Similar results were
seen in melanoma cells with transfected EpoR siRNA (Supplementary Figure 1C).

Author Manuscript

To assess effect of chemotherapeutic agents on EpoR knockdown melanoma cells, control
WM35 and WM35EpoRkd cells were treated with Epo (5U/ml), cisplatin 100 µM, or
combination of Epo/cisplatin for 24 hours. Epo significantly inhibited cisplatin induced cell
death in the control cells but not in EpoR knockdown melanoma cells (Figure 1G). In
addition, EpoR knockdown cells were more sensitive to cisplatin induced cell death (Figure
1G). We then examined the effect of EpoR knockdown on hypoxia tolerance of melanoma
cells by culturing these cells under 1% O2. EpoR knockdown resulted in a 60% decrease of
1205Lu cell survival compared to control cells under hypoxic conditions (Figure 1H).
EpoR knockdown in vivo

We injected WM35EpoRkd, WM793EpoRkd, 1205LuEpoRkd cells or respective control cells
subcutaneously into the flank of nude mice. Following EpoR knockdown, WM35 cells were
not able to form any xenografts in mice (Figure 2A and 2B); tumor volume of WM793 and
1205Lu EpoR knockdown cells was significantly reduced compared to control groups
(Figure 2A and 2B). During necropsy, we noticed that half of the mice receiving control
1205Lu cells developed ascites (Figure 2A), while this was not seen in any mice injected
with 1205LuEpoRkd cells. Histological examination showed that despite the xenografts
formed by EpoR knockdown cells were significantly smaller compared to control tumor
cells, there was significant amount of tumor necrosis (Figure 2C). We quantified the area of
tumor necrosis on representative H&E stained sections and found that 50.0±11.6% of the
area in 1205LuEpoRkd xenografts were necrotic whereas 32.5±13.2% of the area in control
xenografts were necrotic. However, the difference was not statistically significantly.
Metastasis of control 1205Lu cells were identified in the lymphatic vessels and internal
organs such as liver in the mice that developed ascites (Supplementary Figure 2), while
metastasis were not observed in any of the mice injected with 1205LuEpoRkd cells. We
counted the number of mitotic figures in the xenografts and found that EpoR knockdown
significantly reduced the mitotic rate in the xenografts (Figure 2D). We performed cleaved
caspase-3 staining for apoptosis by immunohistochemistry in the xenografts, and no
significant changes were identified (Supplemental Figure 2).

Constitutive EpoR activation in vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the role of EpoR in melanoma progression, we transfected 451Lu,
WM793 and 1361C melanoma cells with expression plasmids containing EpoR-R129C, a
constitutively active EpoR mutant (Pharr et al. 1993). Transfected cells were selected and
well-formed clones were isolated, expanded and screened for EpoR expression. Random
clones with increased expression of EpoR were used for further experiments (Figure 3A for
451Lu; supplemental Figure 3A and 3B for WM793 and 1361C cells). Melanoma cells
transfected with empty expression vectors were used as controls. EpoR-R129C transfected
melanoma cells exhibited increased phosphorylation of JAK2, ERK and AKT, supporting
constitutive activation of the EpoR pathway in these cells (Figure 3A). We found that
constitutively active EpoR significantly increased melanoma cell proliferation under
normoxic (Figure 3B) or hypoxic conditions (Figure 3C) in vitro. To examine the effect of
cisplatin on melanoma cells with EpoR activation, 451Lu with EpoR-R129C or control cells
were treated with cisplatin or cisplatin/Epo(5U/ml). The presence of EpoR activation or Epo
significantly inhibited cisplatin-mediated cell death compared to control cells (Figure 3D).
Constitutive EpoR activation in vivo

Author Manuscript

To study the effect of constitutive activation of EpoR in vivo, we injected melanoma cells
with EpoR-R129C or control vectors into the flanks of immunocompromised mice. As
shown in Figure 4A, expression of EpoR-R129C in melanoma cells was associated with
significantly faster growth of tumors, and the average tumor size was 3 times that of
controls. The mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks, and the xenografts were excised, weighed
and processed for histology. As shown in Figure 4B, the tumors formed by EpoR-R129C
melanoma cells were significantly larger than tumors consisting of control cells. The
xenografts formed by control cells were confined to the dermis at the inoculation site and
showed focal tumor necrosis (Figure 4C) after 4 weeks, whereas EpoR-R129C expressing
melanoma cells invaded into the surrounding structures, such as the femoral bone (Figure
4C). To dissect the underlying mechanism, we studies the degree of hypoxia within the
xengrafts by staining the tumor sections with an antibody to CAIX, a well established tissue
hypoxia marker (Carlin et al. 2010) and quantified the staining using a modify H score
method as we previously described (Kumar et al. 2005). The CAIX expression was
significantly increased in tumors formed by EpoR-R129C cells. Nevertheless, we found that
the area with tumor necrosis was significantly smaller in the xenografts formed by EpoRR129C cells compared to control cells (Figure 4E), further supporting that constitutive EpoR
activation may enhance melanoma cell survival under hypoxia in vivo.
Effect of recombinant Epo treatment on melanoma growth in vivo

Author Manuscript

Since constitutive activation of EpoR increases melanoma growth, we then tested whether
exogenous Epo treatment may influence melanoma growth in vivo. To better monitor tumor
growth, we used GFP-labeled 1232Lu melanoma cells which express EpoR by RT-PCR and
western blot (data not shown). These cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of
nude mice. On the following day, animals randomized to the Epo treatment group started to
receive daily subcutaneous Epo injections and the control group received saline for 8 weeks.
Tumor growth was measured twice a week using a caliper. As expected, there was a

significant increase in hemotocrits in Epo treated group (Figure 5A), but exogenous Epo had
no significant effect on tumor growth in these mice (Figure 5B). After 8 weeks, the
xenografts were surgically removed, the surgical area was inspected to ensure that no visible
tumor was left, and the wound was closed. We stained the sections with antibody against
CD34, an endothelial cell marker, and found that blood vessels in the Epo-treated group
were more dilated compared to these in the control group (Figure 5C). We quantified the
vessels with open lumen and confirmed that Epo treatment significantly increased the vessel
size in the xenografts (Figure 5D). We also stained the primary xenografts with antibodies to
Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry and we did not found significant
difference between Epo treated and control tumors (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

After removing the primary tumor, these mice were observed for an additional 6 weeks for
local recurrence or metastasis. Three of four mice in the control group and all four mice in
the Epo-treated group developed recurrence near the previous inoculation site. In vivo
imaging was used to visualize the GFP expressing tumor cells and showed that recurrent/
metastatic tumors in the Epo-treated group were larger compared to controls (Figure 5E).
The tumor volume was measured at the end of the sixth week. Recurrent tumors were
significantly larger in the Epo treated group (Figure 5F).
Effect of Epo in angiogenesis assays in vivo

Author Manuscript

Since Epo had an effect on blood vessels in the xenografs, we then directly assessed whether
Epo induces angiogenesis. The growth factor deleted Matrigel plugs were supplemented
with VEGF or Epo. There was little new vessel formation in control Matrigel plugs
macroscopically (Figure 6A control) and histology showed little growth of vessels in these
Matrigel plugs (Figure 6B control). Angiogenesis was increased in the plugs supplemented
with VEGF (Figure 6A VEGF) and histology showed blood filled vessels in the Matrigel
plugs (Figure 6B VEGF). Angiogenesis was also increased in plugs supplemented with Epo
(Figure 6A Epo) and histology showed blood vessels in the Matrigel plugs (Figure 6B Epo).

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that WM35 melanoma cells can produce and secrete Epo in vitro
(Kumar et al. 2005). We performed a modified Matrigel plug assay by mixing Matrigel with
WM35 melanoma cells (2×106 in 500µl Matrigel) in the presence of a blocking anti-Epo
antibody (25 µg/plug). The Matrigel mixtures were injected into the flank region of nude
mice and left in place for 9 days. The Matrigel plugs were harvested and processed for
histology and immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to CD34. We found that the
plugs mixed with melanoma cells showed significant growth of blood vessels (Figure 6C
control). In contrast, the Matrigel plugs with melanoma cells and anti-Epo antibody showed
significantly less well formed vessels (Figure 6C, Anti-Epo antibody). The vessel density
was significantly higher in the control plugs (Figure 6D).

Discussion
The demonstration of adverse clinical outcomes of poor survival and potential for increased
tumor progression reported in a series of trials associated with rHuEpo use in cancer patients
has raised serious safety concerns. The mechanisms of the observed adverse clinical effects
have remained elusive and whether expression of EpoR mRNA transcripts and protein found

in many different types of primary human tumors modulates tumor cell behavior has been
controversial (Sytkowski 2007). In this study, we showed that EpoR gene is frequently
expressed with copy number increase in melanoma and EpoR activation supports melanoma
cell survival in vivo.
Our gene expression profiling studies showed that a majority of early passage melanoma cell
lines express EpoR. This result is supported by a recent study showing that expression of
EpoR protein can be detected by immunohistochemistry in about 50% of the analyzed
melanoma metastasis specimens (Mirmohammadsadegh et al. 2010). The aCGH study using
primary melanoma tissues with a broader representation of different melanoma subtypes
showed that DNA copy number increases at the Epo and EpoR loci are common (30% and
24.6% respectively) and that these aberrations are particularly frequent in acral and mucosal
melanomas.

It has been shown that embryonic neural crest cells express functional EpoR (Knabe et al.
2005; Tsai et al. 2006). Since melanocytes are neural crest derivatives and it may be not
surprising that EpoR is functional in melanoma. Lodish and colleagues have demonstrated
that small numbers of high-affinity Epo surface binding sites are present on tumor cells of
neural origin, and the high affinity binding of Epo to these tumor cells is mediated by EpoR
(Um et al. 2007). The antibody we used has been shown to recognize the human EpoR
protein (Knabe et al. 2005; LaMontagne et al. 2006; Paragh et al. 2009). In this study, EpoR
protein expression as detected by this antibody decreased significantly after EpoR shRNA or
siRNA transfection, with a concomitant decrease in EpoR mRNA expression determined by
quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, Epo induced activation of ERK pathway was significantly
down-regulated in melanoma cells with EpoR knockdown. Taken together, our studies
suggest that melanoma cells express biologically active and functional EpoR.

Author Manuscript

We found that EpoR expression supports tumorigenesis in the xenograft model.
WM35EpoRkd cells were incapable of forming xenografts, whereas the tumor mass of
WM793EpoRkd and 1205LuEpoRkd cells were significantly smaller compared to controls.
Although EpoR knockdown did not change the growth rate of 1205Lu cells under normoxia,
hypoxia significantly reduced 1205LuEpoRkd cell growth in vitro, suggesting that EpoR
function in tumors is oxygen tension dependent. Since hypoxia is very common in solid
tumors (Koritzinsky and Wouters 2007; Wouters and Koritzinsky 2008), this may explain
the profound effect of EpoR knockdown in the xenograft model whereas EpoR knockdown
only has modest effect on cell proliferation in vitro under normoxia. In addition, unlike the
parent 1205Lu cells which are highly aggressive and are able to metastasize, 1205LuEpoRkd
cells were confined to the primary inoculation sites, suggesting that EpoR expression may
also contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis. This conclusion is further supported by the
experiments showing that melanoma cells with EpoR-R129C formed larger xenografts with
deeper invasion into surrounding tissues. We showed that larger xenografts formed by
melanoma cells with EpoR-R129C have higher degree of hypoxia demonstrated by stronger
CAIX staining, however, necrotic area in these xenografts was significantly smaller
comparing to control cells, further supporting that activation of EpoR increases tumor cell
hypoxia tolerance.

Given our data suggesting that EpoR activation support melanoma growth in vivo, it was
surprising to see that exogenous Epo treatment failed to enhance melanoma growth in vivo.
However, these results are consistent with the reported findings of prior studies showing that
recombinant Epo failed to increase human squamous cell, colorectal and breast carcinoma
growth in animal models (LaMontagne et al. 2006; Tovari et al. 2005). These result led us to
devise a novel animal model to study the role of exogenous Epo administration on in vivo
tumor growth. One of the limitations of previous studies has been the relatively short
duration of Epo treatment. Another limitation has been the difficulty presented by
continuing tumor growth follow-up in animals bearing large tumors after 8 weeks (Arcasoy
2008; Sinclair et al. 2007). To address these limitations, we surgically removed the primary
tumors and continued the Epo treatment, an approach mimicking excision of primary human
tumor. Importantly, we found that that the local recurrence of melanoma was increased by
this regimen, suggesting that despite the lack of effect of Epo on tumor cell proliferation, it
may enhance the survival of melanoma cells under less favorable, hypoxic growth
conditions in the wounded areas (Daniel and Groves 2002; Kumar et al. 2005). Since our
study also showed that Epo increases angiogenesis in melanoma, these data indicate that
although melanoma cells express biologically functional EpoR, short term Epo treatment (8
weeks) does not induce proliferation of melanoma cells in vivo. However, it may increase
the survival of EpoR expressing melanoma cells under less favorable growth conditions
through both its direct effect on tumor cells and/or its indirect effects on tumor
neoangiogenesis. The effect of Epo on tumor growth is likely dosage and duration
dependent. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to fully elucidate the effect of long term
Epo treatment on tumor growth in vivo.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our data strongly suggest that EpoR activation enhances melanoma cell
survival in vivo. However, the effects of Epo on tumor cells appear to be complex, and the
potential effect of exogenous Epo may depend not only on the presence of EpoR on tumor
cells, but also treatment duration and dosage.

Materials and Methods

All animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the IACUC at the
University of Pennsylvania. For EpoR knockdown studies in vivo, 4 million EpoR
knockdown cells (WM35EpoRkd, WM793EpoRkd, 1205LuEpoRkd) or respective control cells
transfected with scramble shRNA were injected into the flank region of nude mice. The
mice were followed for 5 weeks and tumor size was measured weekly (Reynolds et al.
2005). For EpoR constitutive activation, 2 million 451Lu stably transfected with EpoRR129C or empty expression vector were used.

To study the effect of recombinant Epo in melanoma xenograft model, we used 1232Lu cells
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Mice randomized to Epo treatment (2000 U/kg)
and control groups and they received daily injection of saline (100µl). Mice were treated
with Epo for 8 weeks, the primary tumors were then removed, the surgical wounds were
inspected to ensure that no visible tumor remained, and the wounds were closed. Mice were
observed for an additional 6 weeks for signs of local recurrence or metastasis. The Epo
group continued to receive twice a week injections of Epo during this period of time. Tumor
recurrence was visualized using the IVIS imaging system at the Bioluminescence Molecular
Imaging Core facility at the University of Pennsylvania. To assess angiogenic effects of Epo
in vivo, we used a well established Matrigel plug assay (Ley et al. 2004). 6–8 week old
athymic nude mice received 500 µl subcutaneous injection of growth factor reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) alone, Matrigel with rHuEpo (500 U/ml of Matrigel), or Matrigel
with rhVEGF (60 ng/ml of Matrigel) (RD system, Minneapolis, MN). In addition, we also
used a modified Matrigel plug assay by mixing Matrigel with WM35 melanoma cells
(2×106 in 500µl Matrigel) or WM35 cells and anti-Epo antibody (25 µg, R&D systems). Six
Matrigel plugs in each group were analyzed.
Genomic Data Analysis in early passage melanoma cell lines
Gene expression profiles of 65 cultured melanoma and 5 human neonatal melanocyte cell
lines were described elsewhere (Lin et al. 2008) and are used in this study and analyzed as
previously described (Yu et al. 2008).
Array CGH in primary melanoma

Author Manuscript

Existing array CGH data from 130 primary invasive melanomas from University of
California, San Francisco were included in the analysis (Curtin et al. 2005). A detailed
breakdown of the cases is shown in supplemental Table 1. All statistical analyses were
performed using the freely available R/Bioconductor software.
Statistical analyses
The data represent mean ± s.e.m values. The effect of treatments and differences among
experimental groups were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and appropriate
post-hoc test. The differences between two experimental groups were determined using
Student’s t-tests. A two-tailed value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
