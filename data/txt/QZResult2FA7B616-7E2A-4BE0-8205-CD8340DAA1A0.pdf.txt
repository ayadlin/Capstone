Abstract
MHC class I–related chain A (MICA) is a ligand for the NKG2Dactivating immunoreceptor that mediates activation of natural killer (NK) cells. The ectodomain of MICA is shed from
tumor cells, which may be an important means of evading
antitumor immunity. We previously reported that patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) display high levels of
soluble MICA in circulation, which could be downregulated by
chemotherapy. The present study shows that anti-HCC drugs
suppress MICA ectodomain shedding by inhibiting expression
of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Both
ADAM10 and CD44, a typical substrate of the ADAM10
protease, were expressed in human HCC tissues and HCC
cells but not in normal liver tissues or cultured hepatocytes.
Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown experiments
revealed that ADAM10 is a critical sheddase for both MICA
and CD44 in HCC cells. Of interest is the finding that
epirubicin clearly downregulated ADAM10 expression and
MICA shedding in HCC cells; its suppressive effect on MICA
shedding was abolished in ADAM10-depleted cells. Epirubicin
treatment also enhanced the NKG2D-mediated NK sensitivity
of HCC cells. Patients with HCC had significantly higher levels
of serum-soluble CD44, which correlated well with serumsoluble MICA levels, thus suggesting a close link between
ADAM10 activity and MICA shedding in these patients. Soluble
MICA and CD44 levels were downregulated with a significant
correlation in patients treated by transarterial chemoembolization using epirubicin. In conclusion, anticancer drugs can
modulate expression of ADAM10, which is critically involved
in MICA ectodomain shedding. Epirubicin therapy may have a
previously unrecognized effect on antitumor immunity in HCC
patients. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8050–7]

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of
cancer deaths worldwide. Chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis
virus infection and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis leads to a
predisposition for HCC, with liver cirrhosis, in particular, being
considered a premalignant condition (1, 2). With regard to

treatment, surgical resection or percutaneous techniques such as
ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation are considered to be
choices for curable treatment of localized HCC, whereas transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a well-established
technique for more advanced HCC (3). The liver contains a large
compartment of innate immune cells [natural killer (NK) cells and
natural killer T cells] and acquired immune cells (T cells; refs. 4, 5),
but the activation of these immune cells after HCC treatments
remains unclear. If such treatments can efficiently activate
abundant immune cells in the liver, this could lead to the
establishment of attractive new strategies for HCC treatment.
MHC class I–related chain A and B (MICA and MICB) are ligands
for NKG2D expressed on a variety of immune cells (6). In contrast
to classic MHC class I molecules, MICA/B are rarely expressed on
normal cells but frequently on tumor cells (7–10). The engagement
of MICA/B and NKG2D strongly activates NK cells and costimulates T cells, enhancing their cytolytic activity and cytokine
production (11). Thus, the MICA/B-NKG2D pathway is an
important mechanism by which the host immune system
recognizes and kills transformed cells (12). In addition to those
membrane-bound forms, MICA/B molecules are also cleaved
proteolytically from tumor cells and appear as soluble forms in
sera of patients with malignancy (13–15). Soluble MICA/B in
circulation downregulates NKG2D expression and disturbs
NKG2D-mediated antitumor immunity (9, 10, 13). We previously
reported that soluble MICA could be detected in sera of HCC
patients (16) and that TACE treatment reduces the levels of soluble
MICA and thereby upregulates the expression of NKG2D (17). Thus,
cancer therapy may have a beneficial effect on NKG2D-mediated
immune responses.
The release of soluble MICA/B from tumor cells is impaired by
metalloproteinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of
members of the metzincin superfamily, such as ADAM proteins
(14, 18). In addition, ERp5, related to protein disulfide isomerase, is
required for the MICA shedding as it reduces disulfide bond of the
a3 domain of MICA (19). Although it may not be a direct protease
for MICA, it may enable proteolytic cleavage through conformational change. Recently, it was reported that MICA shedding of
293T fibroblast cells and HeLa cervical cancer cells was inhibited
by silencing of the ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases (20). This
suggests that ADAM family proteins may be a therapeutic target for
enhancing antitumor immunity, but how to therapeutically
modulate these proteins is still not clear. Furthermore, it remains
to be determined whether ADAMs can regulate MICA shedding in a
clinical setting.
In the present study, we showed that ADAM10, but not ADAM17,
was critically required for MICA shedding in human HCC cells. Of
importance is the discovery that epirubicin, a widely used antiHCC drug, was capable of downregulating ADAM10 expression and

activity in HCC cells; it can thus inhibit MICA shedding and
enhance NK sensitivity. ADAM10 was immunohistochemically
detected in HCC tissues and a correlation was observed between
soluble MICA levels and ADAM10 activity determined by soluble
CD44 levels in HCC patients. The present study sheds light on
previously unrecognized effects of an anticancer drug on
modulating ADAM family proteins and MICA shedding and thus

suggests a promising aspect for chemoimmunotherapy against
human HCC.

were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using the ABC procedure
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The primary antibodies used were

the staining, primary antibodies were incubated with recombinant CD44 or
ADAM10 protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 3 h and then applied
onto liver sections in parallel with staining of the primary antibodies as the
absorption test.

siRNA. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were analyzed for specific
depletion of the mRNAs of ADAM10 and ADAM17 by real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
following siRNAs were used: ADAM10, 5¶-AUAUCUGGGCAAUCACAGCUUCUCG-3¶; scramble control, 5¶-AUACUUGGUCAACGCACUUCGAUGG3¶; ADAM17, 5¶-UGAACAAGCUCUUCAGGUGGUUCUC-3¶; scramble control,

determined by DuoSet MICA eELISA kit (R&D Systems) and soluble
CD44std ELISA (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), respectively.
Flow cytometry. For the detection of membrane-bound MICA and
CD44, cells were incubated with an anti-MICA–specific antibody (2C10,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-CD44 antibody (R&D
Systems) and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Beckman Coulter) as a secondary reagent and then subjected to
flow cytometric analysis. For the detection of ADAM10 or ADAM17, cells
were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) and stained with PE-conjugated anti-ADAM10 or anti-ADAM17
antibody (R&D Systems). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a
FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Plasmid construction of pMyc-MICA. MICA full coding cDNA was
isolated from Huh7, human HCC cells, using a conventional RT-PCR
method (Supplementary Fig. S1, DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank accession number
AB506764) and inserted into the HindIII-Xbal site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A
C-myc tag was placed between the leader peptide and the a1 domain of
MICA by site-specific mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) referred to as pMyc-MICA. Cells
were transfected with pMyc-MICA using a Lipofectamine LTX reagent
(Invitrogen). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)–expressing vector
(pEGFP-C1, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was cotransfected to evaluate
the transfection efficiency.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells or tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, and PBS. To the cell
supernatants, 0.5% NP40 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors were added.
The protein contents of the samples were determined by BCA protein assay
kit (Pierce, Rackford, IL). Immunoprecipitation with anti–c-Myc beads was
performed for 1 h at 4jC. Immunocomplexes were eluted by a c-Myc–
tagged peptide solution (MBL, Woburn, MA). The samples after immunoprecipitation were treated with 250 mU of N-glycosidase F (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) for 3 h at 37jC.

Western blotting. The total cellular protein was electrophoretically
separated using SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBSTween containing 5% skim milk for 1 h and then probed with anti-Myc
mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at
4jC overnight. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and
SuperSignal West Pico System (Pierce) were used for the detection of blots.
Real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and was reverse transcribed using SuperScript
III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels were
evaluated using ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems). Ready-to-use assays (Applied Biosystems) were used for the
quantification of ADAM10 (Hs00153853_m1), ADAM17 (Hs00234221_m1),
MICA (Hs00792195_m1), h-actin (Hs99999903_m1), and CD44
(Hs00174139_m1) mRNAs according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The thermal cycling conditions for all genes were 2 min at 50jC and 10 min
at 95jC, followed by 40 cycles at 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min. h-Actin
mRNA from each sample was quantified as an endogenous control of
internal RNA.
WST-8 assay. HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with different
concentrations of epirubicin for 24 h. Cell growth of epirubicin-treated HCC
cells was determined by WST-8 assay (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) as
previously described (21).
NK cell analysis. NK cells were isolated from human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells by magnetic cell sorting using CD56 MicroBeads
(Miltenyl Biotech, Auburn, CA) as previously described (16). The cytolytic
ability of NK cells was assessed by 4-h 51Cr-releasing assay with or
without MICA/B-blocking antibody (6D4; ref. 7), which binds to the a1
and a2 domains of MICA and MICB. 6D4 was a generous gift from Drs.
Veronika Groh and Thomas Spies (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, Seattle, WA).
Statistics. All values were expressed as the mean and SD. The statistical
significance of differences between the groups was determined by applying
Student’s t test or two-sample t test with Welch correction after each group

Results
ADAM10 and CD44 are overexpressed in human HCC.
ADAM10 was detected in all human HCC tissues tested by
immunohistochemistry but not in normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A).
Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ADAM10 was strongly
expressed in a variety of HCC cell lines, including HepG2, PLC/
PRF/5 (depicted in Fig. 1B), and Hep3B (data not shown), but
faintly in primary hepatocytes. CD44, a typical substrate of the
ADAM10 protease, was also expressed in all human HCC tissues

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

but not in normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A). The data suggest that
overexpression of ADAM10 and CD44 is a characteristic of human
HCC like other malignancies (22).
ADAM10 is involved in MICA shedding of HCC cells but
ADAM17 is not. To examine the involvement of ADAM family
proteins in MICA ectodomain shedding, ADAM10 or ADAM17 were
knocked down in HCC cells using a siRNA-mediated procedure.
ADAM10 expression was clearly suppressed in HepG2 cells and
PLC/PRF/5 cells at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B and C).
Both cell lines expressed CD44 on the cellular surface and produced
significant levels of soluble CD44 (Fig. 1D), indicating that CD44 is
expressed and shed from those cell lines. ADAM10 knockdown (KD)

led to an increase in CD44 expression on HCC cells and a decrease
in soluble CD44 levels in culture supernatants (Fig. 1D). Because
ADAM10 has been established as being a sheddase for CD44, siRNAmediated knockdown of ADAM10 suppressed not only the
expression but also the activity of ADAM10 in HCC cells. HepG2
and PLC/PRF/5 cells also expressed ADAM17, which was clearly
knocked down by a siRNA-mediated procedure (Fig. 1B).
HepG2 cells and PLC/PRF/5 cells expressed membrane-bound
MICA and also produced soluble MICA (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of
ADAM10 for both cell lines clearly upregulated MICA expression on
their cellular surface and downregulated soluble MICA levels in
their culture supernatant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, knockdown of
ADAM17 did not affect the expression of membrane-bound MICA
or the production of soluble MICA (Fig. 2B). We also examined the
involvement of ADAM17 in MICA shedding of phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA)–stimulated HCC cells because ADAM17 is
considered to primarily affect stimulated shedding. The expression
of membrane-bound MICA and the soluble MICA production were
equal between PMA-stimulated ADAM17KD-HCC cells and control
HCC cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, ADAM10, but not
ADAM17, is critically involved in the shedding of MICA in HCC cells.
We next evaluated the cytolytic activity of NK cells against
HCC cells. The cytolytic activity of NK cells against ADAM10KDHepG2 cells was higher than that against control HepG2 cells.
This activity was inhibited by blocking of anti-MICA/B antibody,
suggesting that the increase of NK sensitivity depended on the
increased expression of membrane-bound MICA on ADAM10KDHepG2 cells, although we could not exclude the possibility of the
involvement of MICB in this cytotoxicity (Fig. 2C). Similar results
were also obtained with ADAM10KD-PLC/PRF/5 cells.
Epirubicin suppresses ADAM10 expression in HCC cells. We
examined the biological modification of human HCC cells by adding
epirubicin, which is commonly used in anti-HCC chemotherapy. We
first examined the cytotoxicity of epirubicin to human HCC cells by
WST-8 assay. Adding >5 Ag/mL of epirubicin resulted in a significant

decrease in cell growth of both HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3B).
Based on these findings, we used 1 Ag/mL of epirubicin to evaluate
the biological effect on human HCC cells without toxicity. Both
HepG2 cells and PLC/PRF/5 cells were cultured for 24 h with
epirubicin and then subjected to analysis of ADAM10 expression.
Epirubicin suppressed ADAM10 expression at the mRNA and protein
levels in both cell lines (Fig. 3C). Although the data are not shown,
doxorubicin also suppressed ADAM10 expression in HCC cells.
Epirubicin inhibits MICA ectodomain shedding and enhances susceptibility to NK cells of HCC cells. The above observations
led us to investigate whether epirubicin or doxorubicin treatment
would affect MICA ectodomain shedding in HCC cells. Epirubicin
treatment led to an increase in membrane-bound MICA expression
and a decrease in soluble MICA production in both HepG2 and PLC/
PRF/5 cells (Fig. 4A). The mRNA levels of MICA did not change after
exposure to epirubicin in both HCC cells (Fig. 4A). Similar data were
obtained with doxorubicin-treated cells (data not shown).
To confirm whether the soluble MICA detected by ELISA was
actually reflected in the cleaved form, we transfected Myc-tagged
MICA into HepG2 cells and collected culture supernatants as well
as cellular lysates. Immunprecipitates from these samples with
anti-Myc were subjected to Western blot analysis after treatment
with N-glycosidase. MICA in the culture supernatants migrated
faster than cellular MICA (Fig. 4B), indicating that the MICA
detected by ELISA is actually processed and released from fulllength MICA. Epirubicin treatment led to a decrease in soluble
MICA protein in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B).
We next evaluated whether the epirubicin treatment could also
modify the NK sensitivity of human HCC cells. Epirubicin-treated
HepG2 cells or PLC/PRF/5 cells were more susceptible to NK cells
than nontreated HepG2 or PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 4C). The cytolytic
activity against epirubicin-treated HCC cells was significantly
decreased to the control levels by adding the anti-MICA/B blocking
antibody. These results showed that the addition of epirubicin
enhanced the NK sensitivity of HCC cell through increased

MICA (MICA ) was evaluated by flow cytometry (A ),
and the soluble MICA (sMICA ) production in the culture
supernatant was evaluated by specific ELISA (B ).
Similar results were obtained from two independent
experiments. *, P < 0.05.

expression of membrane-bound MICA, although the possibility of
MICB involvement could not be excluded. The doxorubicin-treated
human HCC cells showed similar results to those obtained from
epirubicin-treated HCC cells (data not shown).
Epirubicin inhibits MICA ectodomain shedding through
suppression of ADAM10. To examine whether the suppressive
effect of epirubicin on MICA shedding occurred through downregulation of ADAM10, HepG2 cells were transfected with ADAM10
siRNA or scramble siRNA as a control and then treated with
epirubicin. Consistent with earlier observations, epirubicin upregulated MICA surface expression and downregulated the levels of
soluble MICA in control cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, neither
upregulation of surface MICA nor downregulation of soluble MICA
levels was observed in ADAM10KD-HepG2 cells. These results
suggest that the suppressive effect of epirubicin on MICA shedding
is mediated by ADAM10 downregulation. We also found similar
results with ADAM10KD-PLC/PRF/5 cells (data not shown).
Soluble CD44 and soluble MICA levels in patients with HCC.
We have shown that ADAM10 is expressed in human HCC tissues.
However, it is not clear whether ADAM10 activity in HCC tissues is
actually involved in MICA shedding in patients. Because ADAM10
was reported to be the constitutive functional sheddase of CD44 (23),
we examined the soluble CD44 levels in HCC patients, which might
be produced from tumor cells through ADAM10 activity. As shown in
Fig. 6A, the soluble CD44 levels in HCC patients (n = 97) were
significantly higher than those in age-matched healthy volunteers
(n = 32). More importantly, soluble MICA levels in HCC patients
significantly correlated with soluble CD44 levels (Fig. 6B), suggesting
a close link between MICA shedding and ADAM10 activity.
We further examined soluble CD44 levels before and 2 weeks
after TACE in HCC patients. Whereas the levels did not change in
nontreated HCC patients during the 2-week interval (n = 9; 306.7 F
82.5 ng/mL and 309.9 F 79.9 ng/mL after 2 weeks), they were
significantly decreased in epirubicin-based TACE-treated HCC
patients (n = 21; 339.7 F 78.1 ng/mL before TACE and 308.9 F
81.4 ng/mL after TACE, P < 0.003). The changes of soluble CD44 in
TACE treatment correlated significantly with those of soluble
MICA (P = 0.0002; Fig. 6C). These results indicated that ADAM10mediated CD44 shedding was decreased after TACE in HCC
patients, implying that this reduction of ADAM10 activity might
be related to the decline in MICA shedding.

Discussion
MICA shedding is thought to be a principal mechanism by which
tumor cells escape from NKG2D-mediated immunosurveillance
(13). Thus, inhibition of MICA shedding should be a reasonable
strategy for enhancing antitumor immunity. In the present study,
we showed that ADAM10 was overexpressed in human HCC tissues
and that ADAM10 knockdown resulted in increased expression of
membrane-bound MICA, decreased production of soluble MICA,
and upregulation of NK sensitivity of human HCC cells. These
results point to ADAM10 as a therapeutic target for inhibiting MICA
shedding, thereby ameliorating immunity against HCC. Waldhauer
and colleagues recently showed that both ADAM10 and ADAM17
proteases are critically involved in the proteolytic release of soluble
MICA of human 293T fibroblast cells and HeLa cervix carcinoma
cells (20). Interestingly, in the present study, ADAM17 knockdown
failed to affect MICA expression in human HepG2 cells or PLC/PRF/
5 cells. Thus, ADAM10, not ADAM17, plays an essential role in the
shedding of MICA in human HCC cells. Anderegg and colleagues

(23) reported that only ADAM10, not ADAM17, contributed to
shedding of CD44 molecules in human melanoma cells although
both ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases were significantly expressed
in human melanoma tissues, suggesting that ADAM10 and ADAM17
do not always work in a similar manner. A recent report showed
that ADAM10, but not ADAM17, could directly bind to calmodulin
(24), which may involve the difference of MICA cleavage between
ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases. Recently, Boutet and colleagues
reported that ADAM17 regulates proteolytic shedding of the MICB
protein, which is another ligand for the NKG2D receptor on
immune cells (25). We previously showed that both soluble MICA
and MICB significantly increased in the sera of HCC patients and
that therapeutic intervention for HCC leads to reduction of soluble

Anti-HCC Chemotherapy Modulates MICA Shedding

MICA levels, but not of soluble MICB levels (17), suggesting a more
important role of soluble MICA in regulating NKG2D expression
after HCC therapy. This led us to focus on the mechanism of MICA
shedding in the present study.
Our results revealed that anticancer drugs such as epirubicin
and doxorubicin downregulated ADAM10 expression and activity,
thereby inhibiting MICA ectodomain shedding. The ADAM family
proteins, which are highly expressed in some tumors, play a role in
secreting growth factors, such as HB-EGF, and migration of cells.
Thus, it is speculated that these proteins could be potential targets
for tumor treatment (22). The present study is the first to show that
clinically available anticancer drugs have an ability to modulate the
expression of ADAM family proteins. They seem to suppress
ADAM10 expression at a transcriptional level, but the precise
mechanism of this suppression is not yet known.
The MICA ELISA system may not equally detect all soluble MICA
(MICA molecules have >60 allelic variants). Our finding that soluble
MICA could be detected in all HCC patients suggests that this system
was applicable for our cohort of HCC patients. However, special
caution should be paid for the use of this ELISA system for widely
polymorphic MICA. Because CD44 is well known to be released into
circulation from tumors by proteolytic cleavage of ADAM10 (23), the
activity of ADAM10 in HCC tissues may be correlated with soluble
CD44 levels. If so, our data suggest a close link between ADAM10
activity and the shedding of MICA in HCC. Furthermore, the decline
in soluble MICA levels correlated well with the decline in soluble
CD44 levels as early as 2 weeks after epirubicin-based TACE therapy.
Reducing the tumor volume by such therapy may have led to both
decreases but it is also possible that epirubicin suppresses ADAM10
activity, thereby inhibiting the shedding of MICA and CD44.
Epirubicin may have a previously unrecognized role in cancer
therapy; that is, affecting ADAM10 activity and MICA shedding
rather than simply serving as a direct toxic agent for tumor cells.
Our data suggest that anti-HCC chemotherapy could remodel
HCC cells, enhancing sensitivity to NK cells by upregulating MICA

expression on the cellular surface. A concomitant decline in soluble
MICA levels ameliorates NK cell ability by upregulating its NKG2D
expression. We previously showed that activation of local innate
antitumor immunity in liver tissues resulted in eliciting tumorspecific acquired immunity (21). If liver innate immunity is
efficiently activated after anti-HCC chemotherapy, an additional
antitumor effect against HCC cells could be expected. Immune
modulators such as a-galactosylceramide have been shown to
efficiently activate liver innate immune cells, including NK cells (21,
26). The combination therapy of anti-HCC chemotherapy and
immunotherapy targeting NK cells might improve the antitumor
effect of unresectable HCC and the prognosis of HCC patients.
In spite of recent progress in HCC therapies, there remains
significant room for improvement, especially with respect to
advanced liver cancer. We have shown here that anti-HCC
chemotherapy resulted in enhanced NK sensitivity of HCC cells
through inhibition of the activity of ADAM10 protease followed by
modification of MICA expression. These findings indicate that
efficient activation of liver innate immunity after anti-HCC
chemotherapy might represent a particularly promising approach
to suppress tumor growth and promote regression in liver cancer
patients.
