ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major hindrance to curative chemotherapy of
various human malignancies. Hence, novel chemotherapeutics must be evaluated for
their recognition by MDR efflux transporters. Herein we explored the cytotoxic activity
of synthetic tubulysin B (Tub-B, EC1009) derivatives (Tub-B-hydrazide/EC0347
and Tub-B bis-ether/EC1820), and their recognition by the MDR efflux transporters
P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and breast
cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Originally isolated from Myxobacteria, tubulysins
exhibited potent cytotoxic activity via microtubule depolymerization, and evaded
recognition by these MDR efflux pumps. We show that subtle modifications in the
natural Tub-B structure enhance its cytotoxicity and drug efflux efficiency. Whereas
increasing the lipophilicity of Tub-B drugs enhanced their diffusion into the cell
and consequently decreased the IC50 values (≥ 0.27 nM), increasing drug polarity
enhanced their recognition by P-gp (>200-fold resistance in P-gp-overexpressing
cells). Furthermore, restricting drug exposure time to the clinically relevant 4 h pulse,
markedly enhanced efflux by P-gp, resulting in a 1000-fold increased resistance,
which was further enhanced upon increased P-gp levels (i.e. an additional 3-fold
increase in P-gp levels resulted in >6,000-fold resistance). The unique ability of
EC1009 to evade recognition by MDR efflux pumps warrants drug development of
tubulysin B derivatives as potent antitumor agents which overcome MDR in cancer.

distantly related to the marine slug alkaloids dolastatins,
and their mode of action resembles that of the Vinca
alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine as well as colchicine
and combretastatins, i.e. binding to β-tubulin in the α-β
heterodimeric form, hence inducing destabilization,
inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule (MT)
depolymerization [1, 4]. This is opposed to MT-stabilizing
agents including paclitaxel, docetaxel, epothilones, and
discodermolide which bind to tubulin polymers and
stabilize MT [5]. Nonetheless, both MT destabilizing and
stabilizing agents alter the equilibrium between tubulin
and MT, resulting in disruption of the mitotic spindle
and cell death. Notably, tubulysins surpass the tumor cell
growth inhibitory potential of vinblastine and the taxene
paclitaxel by one to three orders of magnitude [2, 6].

INTRODUCTION
In the ongoing quest for novel antitumor agents,
researchers often turn to the natural pharmacopeia
as a reliable source of multiple cytotoxic agents. In
2000, Reichenbach and his colleagues discovered four
peptide-like compounds from strains of the solid bacteria
Myxobacteria, containing unique amino acids; these
natural products displayed potent cytostatic antitumor
activity [1]. As these hydrophobic peptides exerted their
cytotoxic activity via binding to tubulin cytoskeleton, they
were named tubulysins; these include tubulysin A, B, D
and E [1]. Following this discovery, multiple tubulysins
were further isolated and characterized, i.e. tubulysins
F-I [2] through Z [3]. The structure of tubulysins is

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon
in which cancer cells display resistance to a wide
spectrum of anticancer drugs which are structurally
and mechanistically distinct [7–10]. MDR, which can
be classified either as intrinsic (i.e. emerging before
chemotherapy) or acquired (provoked by chemotherapy),
continues to be a dominant hindrance to curative cancer
therapy [11–15]. Various mechanisms of cancer MDR
have been described, albeit, active drug extrusion from
cancer cells by ATP-driven efflux transporters remains a
central mechanism of MDR [9, 15–18]. Enhanced drug

efflux is predominantly mediated by ATP-dependent
extrusion pumps of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
superfamily, including P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp, ABCB1/
MDR1) [19–22], multidrug resistance-associated proteins
(MRPs/ABCC) like MRP1 (ABCC1) [23, 24] as well as
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [25, 26].
These drug extrusion pumps couple the energy derived
from ATP hydrolysis to the expulsion of a multitude
of cytotoxic compounds which are structurally and
mechanistically distinct. This potent drug efflux results
in a marked decrease in the intracellular concentration

of these antitumor agents, thereby conferring MDR to
a wide array of chemotherapeutic agents [16, 27, 28].
Despite various approaches aimed at the overcoming of
chemoresistance [12, 29–34], MDR continues to be one of
the leading causes of chemotherapy failure and mortality.
Tubulysins exhibit relatively low substrate
recognition by P-gp when compared to other antimicrotubule agents such as vinblastine, vincristine,
vindesine, colchicine, paclitaxel and docetaxel [1,
6]. While tubulysins display characteristics of potent
chemotherapeutic agents, they were purified from
Myxobacteria in minute yields (<4 mg/liter of culture
medium) [1, 2], hence hindering their commercial
availability and clinical application. This challenge urged
organic chemists to synthesize tubulysins [35–39]. Since
tubulysins are extremely cytotoxic, several research
groups have rationally designed tubulysin conjugates and
nanoparticles to facilitate selective targeting of the drug to
tumor cells, while preventing untoward toxicity to normal
tissues [40–45]. For example, the synthesis of folic acidtubulysin B conjugates was undertaken by Endocyte Inc.
who developed novel synthetic tubulysin derivatives
(i.e. tubulysin B-hydrazide, Tub-B-hyd; and tubulysin
B methyl-ether; tubulysin B-ester) [42, 46]. Herein we
studied the cytotoxic activity of Tub-B (EC1009) and

its free analogues Tub-B-hyd (EC0347) and Tub-B bisether (EC1820), the structures of which are illustrated in
Figure 1, as well as their recognition by the three dominant
MDR efflux transporters P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP. We
further explored the impact of the drug exposure time
on the ability of P-gp to abolish the cytotoxic effect of
these Tub-B analogues. We found that the original natural
structure of Tub-B is best suited to evade substrate
recognition and extrusion by these MDR efflux pumps.
While the structural differences we explored enhanced the
cytotoxic potential of these compounds, they markedly
enhanced recognition by certain MDR efflux transporters.
Moreover, the longer the exposure time to these fast-acting
drugs, the smaller the effect of the MDR transporters on
the cytotoxic outcome. These findings bear important
implications for rational drug design and the overcoming
of MDR in cancer.

RESULTS
Disruption of microtubules by synthetic Tub-B
derivatives
Original studies by Reichenbach and colleagues
have shown that a 4 hr pulse exposure of tumor cells to

transfected with a G-β-myc expression vector and subjected to a 4h pulse treatment with 20nM EC0347 or EC1820. Immunofluorescence
microscopy was performed, as detailed under Materials and Methods, using drug-free control cells (A), EC0347 (B), and EC1820 (C) treated
cells to evaluate the status of the microtubule network (red fluorescence), and G-β-myc (green fluorescence) as a plasma membrane marker.

tubulysin A resulted in the disruption of cellular MT [1, 4],
whereas the more active tubulysin D induced multipolar
spindles [4]. Hence, to confirm that our tubulysin B
derivatives also block microtubule polymerization in
our tumor cell system, we used immunofluorescence
microscopy with a β-tubulin-specific monoclonal antibody
(Figure 2). Expectedly, 4 hr pulse treatment of human
ovarian carcinoma 2008/WT cells with 20 nM of the Tub
B derivatives EC0347 and EC1820 resulted in disruption
of cytoskeletal MT (Figure 2). While treatment with
EC0347 yielded a less pronounced microtubule network
(compare Figure 2B with 2A, red fluorescence), EC1820
completely abolished any recognizable tubulin structure

(compare Figure 2C with 2A, red fluorescence). The myctagged plasma membrane inhabitant G-β protein was used
to trace the plasma membrane (compare Figure 2B and 2C
with 2A, green fluorescence). Consistent with the original
studies of Reichenbach and colleagues, these findings
confirm that the Tub B derivatives EC0347 and EC1820
disrupt MT assembly at nanomolar drug concentrations
upon clinically relevant 4 h pulse exposure.

Tub-B-Hyd/EC0347 is a good substrate of P-gp
Based on this anti-microtubule activity, we next
explored the cytotoxic potential of these novel Tub-B

EC1009, EC0347 and EC1820, using the XTT cell proliferation kit. (A) Evaluation of the compounds’ cytotoxicity in the three indicated
parental cell lines. Differences between the curves at the IC50 concentration had P-values between 0.049 to 4x10-5. (B) Evaluation of the
compounds’ cytotoxicity in parental KB-3-1 cells and their P-gp overexpressing subline, KB-V1, in the absence or presence of the potent

the IC50 concentration had P-values ≤0.0065. (C) Evaluation of the compounds’ cytotoxicity in parental 2008/WT cells and their MRP1overexpressing subline, 2008/MRP1, in the absence or presence of the potent MRP1 transport inhibitor MK571. Results were normalized
to the drug-free control for each treatment and are the means of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates ±S.D. All
the differences between the killing curves at the IC50 concentration had P-values between 0.037 to 2x10-5 excluding the curves of 2008/
MRP1+MK571 vs. 2008/WT for EC1009 and EC0347 which were insignificant.

All differences shown as fold of resistance have a P-value<0.05 excluding those indicated by an a.
analogues; towards this end, we employed a smallscale model of the screening methodology of the
NCI-60, which has been used by the Developmental
Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds
since 1990. We thus used three established human
MDR tumor cell lines overexpressing the dominant
MDR efflux transporters P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP (i.e.
KB-V1, 2008/MRP1 and A549/K1.5, respectively),
their drug sensitive parental counterparts, as well as
their specific MDR transport inhibitors TQD [47],
MK571 [48] and Ko143 [49]. Cells were exposed to the
various cytotoxic compounds for 48h in the presence
or absence of these specific MDR efflux transporter
inhibitors and cell viability was determined. Figure 3
depicts the killing curves obtained with each Tub-B
compound and the IC50 values are summarized in Table
1. EC1820 was the most cytotoxic derivative in all three
parental tumor cell lines 2008/WT, KB-3-1 and A549
(IC50 values 0.27±0.02, 0.28±0.07 and 0.47±0.04 nM,
respectively), with 3-4-fold lower IC50 values compared
to the parent drug and the other Tub-B derivative
(Figure 3A, Table 1). EC1009 and EC0347 exhibited
comparable IC50 values, except for parental 2008/WT
cells. A549/K1.5 cells with BCRP overexpression
[27] displayed only a minor cross-resistance towards
these compounds (i.e. 27-38% increase in the IC50
values), when compared to their parental counterparts.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Moreover, this minor cross-resistance was reversed by
the specific BCRP transport inhibitor Ko143 only with
the parent drug EC1009 (Table 1).
MRP1 displayed a higher degree of drug substrate
recognition than BCRP, leading to a 2.5-8.8-fold increase
in the IC50 values in the MRP1-overexpressing ovarian
cancer cell line 2008/MRP1 [50]; co-treatment with the
potent MRP1 transport inhibitor MK571 fully restored
cellular sensitivity to these drugs, indicating that this drug
resistance was solely mediated by MRP1. Furthermore,
parental 2008/WT cells displayed a 4-fold decrease in the
IC50 values towards the synthetic analogues in the presence
of the MRP1 inhibitor (Table 1, P≤0.031). The highest
cross-resistance factor was found in P-gp-overexpressing
KB-V1 cells [51]. While EC1009 was the least recognized
as an MDR transport substrate, with a modest 6-fold
increase in drug resistance (P=0.0065), EC0347 was
efficiently extruded by P-gp, hence leading to an increase
as high as 209-fold in the IC50 value in KB-V1 cells (i.e.
IC50 values of 177±23 vs. 0.85±0.09 nM, P=0.0028).
Thus, the parent drug EC1009 was the least recognized as
a transport substrate by the three MDR efflux transporters.

Differential recognition of drugs by P-gp is most
evident in clinically relevant drug exposure times

clinical i.v. infusion time of tubulysin-cognate antitumor
agents such as vinblastine and paclitaxel is 1 min and 3h,
respectively [52]. In addition, the serum concentration
of these drugs following i.v. administration rapidly
decreases, with a 10-fold fall within several minutes
to hours [53, 54]. Furthermore, we have previously
demonstrated a time-dependent resistance to antifolates
through the activity of the MDR efflux exporters
MRP1 and BCRP [55, 56]. Taking these factors into
consideration together with our immunofluorescence
results, we undertook the same experiments with a much
shorter tubulysin drug exposure time, i.e. a 4h pulse
exposure, and evaluated its impact on P-gp-dependent
Tub-B derivative drug resistance. Since parental KB-3-1
cells are devoid of detectable P-gp levels (Figure 5) [51,
57] and as TQD had no effect on the IC50 values in KB3-1 cells during the 48h experiments, it was redundant to
repeat TQD supplementation to these cells.
Limiting the drug exposure time to 4h had two
prominent impacts: a) the IC50 values of the three Tub-B
compounds increased by 5-10 fold, further expanding the
difference in the cytotoxicity between the original parent

drug EC1009 and its derivative EC1820 to 7.7-fold (vs. 3.9fold upon 48h exposure, Figure 4A and Table 2). b) P-gpdependent resistance towards the synthetic Tub-B analogues
increased dramatically, i.e. 136-fold (P=0.0091) and 1072fold (P=0.0001) for EC1820 and EC0347, respectively
(Table 2 and Figure 4), while the resistance to the parent
drug EC1009 was slightly decreased by 1.6-fold (i.e. 6-fold
resistance at 48h vs. 3.7-fold resistance at 4h).
We next explored the impact of a further increase
in cellular P-gp levels on the extent of drug resistance
towards the various Tub-B derivatives. Towards this
end, KB-V1 cells were further exposed for two weeks
to 250 ng/ml vinblastine, the original selecting agent
used for the establishment of the KB-V1 cell line, thus
positively selecting for the highest P-gp-overexpressing
cells. Western blot analysis revealed that these vinblastineselected KB-V1 cells, i.e. KB-V1-VBT, acquired a
3-fold increase in P-gp levels relative to KB-V1 cells
that were not further exposed to vinblastine (Figure 5).
These newly selected cells were now assessed for their
Tub B-derivative sensitivity using cytotoxicity assays.
Remarkably, the 3-fold further increase in cellular P-gp

P-gp transport inhibitor Tariquidar (TQD). All differences between the killing curves at the IC50 concentration had P-values between 0.043
to 4x10-7, excluding KB-V1+TQD (circles) vs. KB-V1-VBT+TQD (plus) which was insignificant for EC0347. Results were normalized to
the drug-free control for each treatment and are the means of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates ±S.D.

DISCUSSION

levels markedly increased the IC50 values of the synthetic
compounds when compared to the original KB-V1 cells;
1,595±140 nM vs. 183±43 nM (i.e. 8.7-fold, P=0.0019)
for EC1820, as well as 26.3±0.2 µM vs. 4.6±0.11 µM (i.e.
5.7-fold, P=4x10-7) for EC0347, resulting in a dramatic
1,180-fold (P=0.00064) and 6,110-fold (P=5x10-6)
resistance, respectively. Hence, the 3-fold increase in
cellular P-gp levels resulted in 8.7-fold and 5.7-fold
increased resistance to EC1820 and EC0347, respectively.
In contrast, consistent with our previous results, the IC50
value of the parent EC1009 compound was only slightly
increased by 3.5-fold (Figure 4 and Table 2, P=5x10-7).
Table 3 summarizes the recognition and efflux capacity
of the tubulysin B derivatives by the different MDR efflux
transporters; hence, whereas BCRP failed to recognize
any of these compounds, MRP1 displayed a poor drug
extrusion of EC1009 and a moderate drug efflux of
EC0347 and EC1820. In contrast, whereas the parent drug
EC1009 was a poor P-gp substrate, EC0347 and EC1820
were bona fide P-gp efflux substrates as evidenced by their
efficient extrusion by this efflux pump.

Here we studied the impact of structural
modifications in Tub-B on the cytotoxic activity as well
as recognition by the dominant MDR efflux transporters
P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP. We also assessed the role of
subtle increases in cellular P-gp levels on the MDR to
these tubulysin B derivatives. In an attempt to mimic the
clinical drug treatment with anti-microtubule agents, we
finally studied the impact of the drug exposure time on
the efficiency of the drug extrusion capacity of P-gp and
consequent drug resistance.
In the ever expanding field of MT inhibitors
currently used as chemotherapeutic agents [5, 58, 59],
tubulysins attract much scientific interest. Various
tubulysin analogues have been recently developed in an
attempt to introduce novel small molecules which are
relatively easy to synthesize, and to better understand
the role of each residue of the molecule in MT binding
and cytotoxic activity [60–66]. However, the vast
majority of these MT-targeted drugs lost the potency of

α-tubulin antibody to confirm actual equal loading (B). Quantification of the protein bands was performed using the EZ-Quant software,

the original parent tubulysins. In the current study, we
studied two Tub-B derivatives which were found to be
as potent as the parent Tub-B drug, namely Tub-B-hyd
(EC0347), or even exceeded the activity of the parent
drug by a factor of 3.5-7.7 in the case of Tub-B bis-ether
(EC1820). Tubulysins were previously found to be highly
cytotoxic, with a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) between
their lipophilicity and cytotoxic activity [2], as well as
their ability to successfully evade recognition by the
MDR efflux transporter, P-gp [1]. We consistently show
here that whereas the parent EC1009 was a poor P-gp
efflux substrate, its hydrazide derivative EC0347 was an
excellent P-gp transport substrate; specifically, EC0347
was efficiently extruded by MDR KB-V1 cells with P-gp
overexpression, hence achieving a very high level of
MDR that could be fully reversed by TQD, a potent P-gp
transport inhibitor. It should be emphasized that the sole
chemical difference between the parent EC1009 drug and
its hydrazide derivative EC0347 is the mere introduction
of a hydrazide group in the tubutyrosine residue (Tut,
Figure 1). The terminal amino group in this hydrazide
residue is positively charged under physiological
conditions (pH of 7.3). Hence, unlike its parent EC1009
drug, EC0347 is a hydrophobic cationic drug at pH 7.3.
In this respect, it is well established that multiple P-gp
transport substrates with distinct structures and modes of
action, as well as transport inhibitors (known as MDR
chemosensitizers), are lipophilic cationic compounds
[67–75]. Furthermore, elimination of a basic center
from the bona fide P-gp substrate doxorubicin overcame
P-gp-dependent MDR, as this anthracycline was no
longer recognized by P-gp as a transport substrate [76].
Remarkably, this apparently strong requirement for a
cationic charge in lipophilic substrates of P-gp has been
also identified in bacterial MDR transporters; it has been
demonstrated that a single membrane-embedded negative
residue in MdfA, the bacterial MDR efflux ancestor of
P-gp, is absolutely required for the binding of a basic
residue in lipophilic toxic compounds such as ethidium
bromide and benzalkonium [77].
It has been previously shown that P-gp is an
ATP-driven unidirectional phospholipid flippase [17],
transporting phospholipids from the inner to the outer
leaflet of the lipid bilayer [78]. In this respect, we as well as
others have previously shown that uncharged hydrophobic
anticancer drugs (such as EC1009) traverse the plasma
membrane very rapidly and exhibit an extremely short
residence time in the lipid core of biomembranes. This
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

membrane residence time is too short to allow for binding
by P-gp and efficient drug extrusion [79]. In contrast,
bona fide hydrophobic cationic P-gp transport substrates
including EC0347 would undergo a relatively slow flipflop in the plasma membrane (Figure 6), hence allowing
sufficient time for P-gp to efficiently bind and expel them
out of cells, thereby resulting in a high level of MDR [80–
85]. Based on the crystal structure of the human P-gp [22],
the large drug-binding site of P-gp (6,000 cubic Å) is rich
in hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids but also contains
polar amino acids. Hence, from a mechanistic perspective,
we propose here that the lipophilic cation EC0347, which
must undergo a slow flip-flop in the plasma membrane in
order to traverse it, can be initially docked via hydrophobic
interactions at the highly hydrophobic binding site of P-gp,
followed by hydrogen bond formation between the polar
residues in the drug-binding site of P-gp and the amino
group of the hydrazide, thereby culminating in efficient
drug expulsion after ATP hydrolysis (Figure 6).
In the current study we also explored minor
modifications in the central unusual amino acid tubuvaline
(Tuv, Figure 1), which is crucial for the compounds’
hydrophobic core as well as the binding to, and
destabilization of MT [86]. The elimination of two polar
C=O double bonds in EC1820 increased the lipophilicity
of the compound in comparison to the parent EC1009 drug
(Log P=6.32±1.1 vs. 5.78±1.1). This markedly enhanced
the anti-proliferative activity of the compound (IC50 values
decreased by 3.4-4.2-fold in the different parental tumor
cell lines after 48h drug exposure and as much as 7.7fold after 4h pulse exposure); this presumably occurs by
improving its diffusion rate across the plasma membrane.
Moreover, this modification increased the recognition
of EC1820 by P-gp (5-fold increased resistance of KBV1 cells at 48h, and 36-fold enhanced resistance at 4h,
compared to EC1009). Introduction of an alteration in the
γ-amino acid homologue of tyrosine, tubutyrosine (Tut,
Figure 1), which increases the polarity of the compound
EC0347 (Log P=4.52±1.06) by replacing the hydroxyl
group with an amide –NH-NH2, had little or no effect on
the IC50 values. On the other hand, recognition by P-gp as
an efflux substrate was highly enhanced by a factor of 35fold upon 48h drug exposure and as much as 120-fold at
4h. As detailed above, we propose that the amino group of
the hydrazide residue of EC0347 undergoes protonation at
physiological pH, conferring an amphiphilic nature to the
compound, thus markedly decreasing its diffusion across
the plasma membrane which presumably proceeds via a

flip-flop mechanism. As discussed above, since P-gp binds
and expels its substrates during their diffusion through
the lipid-core of the plasma membrane much before they
reach the cytoplasm [20], the increased polarity of EC0347
and hence its presumed slower diffusion rate across the
plasma membrane renders it a much better P-gp transport
substrate than the parent drug EC1009.
While P-gp recognizes only lipophilic substrates,
MRP1 transports both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
compounds with diverse structures [87]. The parental
drug EC1009 was inefficiently recognized and extruded by
MRP1 with a 2.5-fold increase in the resistance of MRP1overexpressing 2008/MRP1 cells, relative to parental 2008/
WT cells. Recognition by MRP1 was increased following
the structural alterations detailed above, resulting in an
increase of ~3.4-fold in the resistance towards EC0347
and EC1820 when compared to the parent drug EC1009.
While EC1009 and EC0347 exhibited comparable IC50
values in both parental A549 and KB-3-1 cells, 2008/
WT cells displayed a 2-fold increase in the IC50 value of
EC0347 compared to EC1009. This could be explained by
the fact that unlike parental A549 and KB-3-1 cells that do
not express any detectable levels of MDR transporters [27,
57], 2008/WT cells express endogenous MRP1 [88]. This
ubiquitous MRP1 expression resulted in cellular resistance
to both EC0347 and EC1820, which was fully reversed by
the MRP1 inhibitor MK571, as evidenced by the 4-fold
hypersensitivity.
The spectrum of BCRP drug substrates is wide
and diverse with the vast majority of BCRP transport
substrates harboring a hydrophobic polyaromatic structure
with the typical presence of residues which are capable
of forming hydrogen bonds with polar amino acids in the
binding site of BCRP [26, 89]. Given that tubulysins are
predominantly linear peptides lacking a multi-aromatic
ring structure, it is not surprising that they were not BCRP
transport substrates.
The pre-clinical NCI-60 drug screening platform is
widely used, although it is not clinically relevant for the
extrusion of multiple anticancer drugs as most drugs are
i.v. administered over several hours and not several days.
We showed here that upon a short 4h drug exposure, which
is more representative of the clinical bolus treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents, P-gp overexpression
had a markedly greater impact on drug efflux than the
long-term drug exposure of 48h. The drug resistance of
KB-V1 cells towards the modified Tub-B compounds
substantially increased upon shortening the drug exposure
time, achieving >1000-fold resistance to EC0347. The
parent EC1009 drug which was the least recognized by
P-gp, efficiently evaded this drug efflux pump during
the 4h exposure period, thereby leading to a decrease
in the resistance of KB-V1 cells (i.e. 3.7-fold vs. 6-fold
resistance at 48h, compared to KB-3-1 cells). This finding
shows that a short drug exposure time markedly expands
the difference between P-gp transport substrates and nonwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

substrates, and hence is more revealing in screening and
evaluation of novel cytotoxic compounds. This conclusion
was further corroborated when P-gp expression levels
were boosted up by further exposing KB-V1 cells to
vinblastine; KB-V1-VBT cells exhibited a remarkable
resistance towards EC1820 (1,100-fold), and as high as
6,100-fold resistance to EC0347 when compared to the
12-fold resistance towards the parent EC1009 drug.
Taken collectively, these novel findings have
important implications for rational drug design of the
proper structural elements of tubulysin B derivatives
necessary to evade and overcome ABC transporterdependent MDR. Hence, unlike multiple naturally
occurring cytotoxic alkaloids and other hydrophobic
compounds which are typically recognized by P-gp
and BCRP including anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids,
epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, epothilones,
dolastatins, gramicidin D, and camptothecins, the parent
tubulysin B drug largely evaded drug efflux via MDR
pumps [79, 80, 89]. This unique and unusual feature
warrants further drug development of tubulysin B
derivatives as potent antitumor agents which overcome
MDR.

was performed using the EZ-Quant software (EZ-Quant,
Tel-Aviv, Israel).

Immunofluorescence
2008/WT cells were seeded in 24-well plates on
sterile glass coverslips and transfected with pcDNA3.1/
Gβ1-myc-His expression vector (kindly provided by
Prof. David Meiri, Dept. of Biology, Technion, Haifa,
Israel) using linear polyethylenimine (PEI, MW 25,000)
transfection reagent (Polysciences, Pennsylvania, USA) at
a ratio of 3µg PEI : 1µg DNA. 20h after transfection, cells
were incubated in the presence of either 20 nM EC0347
or 20nM EC1820 for 4h. Then, cells were washed with
medium, fixed [4% formaldehyde in PBS, for 15min at
room temperature (RT)] and permeabilized using 0.1%
Triton X100 for 5 min. Blocking was performed with a
blocking solution (20% skimmed milk in TBS) for 1hr
at RT followed by co-incubation with primary anti-myc
antibody (1:250, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-αtubulin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in
20% blocking solution for 1hr at RT. Coverslips were
washed 3 times with PBS and co-incubated with Dylight
488-conjugated donkey anti-Rabbit IgG and Dylight
594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), for
1hr at RT. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were
mounted onto glass slides using Fluoromount-G (Southern
Biotechnology Associates) and examined using a confocal
Zeiss LSM 710 microscope.

Growth inhibition assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After 48h,
the growth medium was replaced by a fresh medium
containing or lacking the appropriate MDR efflux
transporter inhibitor (i.e. 400nM TQD, 400nM Ko143,
or 50µM MK571), followed by immediate addition of
increasing concentrations of EC1009, EC1820 or EC0347.
After 4h or 48h, monolayer cells were washed twice with
growth medium. For the 4h drug exposure experiments,
cells were allowed to grow for an additional 44h before
growth inhibition was determined using a colorimetric
cell proliferation kit (XTT, Biological Industries, Beit
HaEmek, Israel). Percent inhibition of cell growth
was calculated relative to drug free controls. IC50 is the
drug concentration exerting 50% cell death. Results
presented were obtained from at least three independent
experiments performed in triplicates. We used a one-tailed
paired Student’s t-test to examine the significance of the
differences between the IC50 values obtained for each
cell line and/or drug (N≥3). A difference was considered
significant if the P-value obtained was <0.05.
