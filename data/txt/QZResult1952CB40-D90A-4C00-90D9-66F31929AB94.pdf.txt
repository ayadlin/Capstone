Abstract

Introduction

We and others have shown that the copper transporters
ATP7A and ATP7B play a role in cellular resistance to cisdiaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). In this study, we found
that ATP7A transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOK1) and fibroblasts isolated from Menkes disease patients
enhanced resistance not only to CDDP but also to various
anticancer drugs, such as vincristine, paclitaxel, 7-ethyl-10hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38), etoposide, doxorubicin,
mitoxantron, and 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]
carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11). ATP7A preferentially localized doxorubicin fluorescence to the Golgi apparatus in
contrast to the more intense nuclear staining of doxorubicin
in the parental cells. Brefeldin A partially and monensin
completely altered the distribution of doxorubicin to the
nuclei in the ATP7A-expressing cells. ATP7A expression also
enhanced the efflux rates of doxorubicin and SN-38 from cells
and increased the uptake of SN-38 in membrane vesicles.
These findings strongly suggested that ATP7A confers
multidrug resistance to the cells by compartmentalizing
drugs in the Golgi apparatus and by enhancing efflux of
these drugs, and the trans-Golgi network has an important
role of ATP7A-related drug resistance. ATP7A was expressed
in 8 of 34 (23.5%) clinical colon cancer specimens but not in
the adjacent normal epithelium. Using the histoculture drug
response assay that is useful for the prediction of drug
sensitivity of clinical cancers, ATP7A-expressing colon cancer
cells were significantly more resistant to SN-38 than ATP7Anegative cells. Thus, ATP7A confers resistance to various
anticancer agents on cancer cells and might be a good index
of drug resistance in clinical colon cancers. [Cancer Res
2007;67(10):4860–8]

Drug resistance in cancer cells is a major obstacle for cancer
chemotherapy. We have previously shown that cells expressing the
ATP7B copper transporter are resistant to cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) and in several heavy metals (1). ATP7A, a second
copper transporter, has also been implicated in CDDP resistance
(2, 3). ATP7B is a P-type ATPase copper transporter, and a
functional deficit of this transporter causes Wilson disease (4, 5).
ATP7A has 67% amino acid identity to the ATP7B protein (6) and
sequence similarity to the bacterial proteins ZntA and CopB, which
confer resistance to heavy metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium,
and silver (7). Copper-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
variant cells displayed a higher expression of ATP7A, amplification
of the ATP7A gene, and a higher efflux rate of copper than the
parental CHO cells (8). A role for ATP7A in copper metabolism in
humans has been suggested by the discovery that ATP7A is the
causative gene of Menkes disease (4–6).
The major biochemical defect in Menkes disease is caused by
copper deficiency and results in death with progressive neurodegeneration and connective tissue disturbance in early childhood.
ATP7A seems to play an important role in the transport of copper
from the intestine to serum. Copper is an essential heavy metal
required for several enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase,
superoxide dismutase, and lysyl oxidase (4, 5).
In this study, we provide evidence that ATP7A is involved in
resistance to various anticancer agents. Furthermore, we explored
mechanisms by which ATP7A might confer multidrug resistance
(MDR) and determined the correlation between ATP7A expression
and SN-38 resistance in clinical colon cancer cells with an ex vivo
drug resistance assay, histoculture drug response assay (HDRA).

ATP7A and Drug Resistance and Clinical Drug Resistance
Me32a-T22/2L is an immortalized fibroblast from a Menkes disease patient
and Me32a/pCMB117 is an ATP7A-transfected Me32a-T22/2L clone,
previously described as clone A12-H9 (10). All cells were cultured in DMEM
(Nissui Seiyaku Co.) containing 20 mmol/L L-proline, 50 Amol/L uridine,
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), and 10% FCS. KBC2 and KB/MRP cells were cultured as described previously (11, 12). MCF-7/
AdVp3000 cells were kindly presented from Dr. Susan Bates and cultured in
Iscove’s modified Eagle medium containing 10% FCS with 3,000 ng/mL
doxorubicin and 5 Ag/mL verapamil (13).
A sheep antibody against human ATP7A was generated using a protocol
described for generation of the rabbit anti-ATP7A and was partially purified
by ammonium sulfate precipitation (9). Commercially obtained antibodies
were mouse monoclonal anti-P-glycoprotein (P-gp; C219; Zymed Laboratories, Inc.), anti-MDR protein 1 (MRP1; MRPm6; Progen Biotechnik
GmbH), anti-MRP4 (MI4-10; Alexis Biochemicals), horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-sheep antibody (ICN), and HRP-conjugated antimouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit antibreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) antibody was kindly donated by
Dr. Yoshikazu Sugimoto (Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan;
ref. 14).
Patient samples. This study was undertaken with the informed consent
of the patients in accordance with the regulations of the Ethics Review
Board of Kagoshima University (Kagoshima, Japan). The study involved
50 patients with advanced colon cancer who underwent surgical therapy
without chemotherapy at Kagoshima University Hospital between July 2002
and April 2004. The specimens contained moderate to well-differentiated
adenocarcinomas and primary or metastatic tumors. Thirty-four of
50 specimens were suitable for evaluation of the sensitivity of the cells to
SN-38 and CDDP using HDRA as described below. Characteristics of these
patients and tumors are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell survival and chemosensitivity assay. Chemosensitivity was
estimated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay using 96-well plates and 2  103 CHO-K1,
3  103 Me32a/pCMB117, and 5  103 each CHO/pCMB117, CHO/615D,
and Me32a-T22/2L cells per well as described previously (1).
Preparation of membrane vesicles. Membrane vesicles were prepared
as described previously and stored at 80jC (1, 15). Protein concentration
was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Immunoblot analyses. Membrane vesicles from the indicated cells
(100 Ag) or from positive control cells (20 Ag) were subjected to 7.5% SDSPAGE under reducing conditions. Immunoblotting was carried out as
described previously (1). All first antibodies were used at a thousand-fold
dilution, and the appropriate HRP-conjugated species-specific antibody was
used as the second antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with
the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system
(Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of fluorescent bands of ATP7A
or MRP4 were quantified using ChemiDoc XRS System and Quality One 1D
Analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and PCR of genomic
DNA. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen), first-strand cDNA was
synthesized from 1 Ag of total RNA using the Rever Tra Ace-a kit
(Toyobo), and genomic DNA was isolated with a Genomic DNA Extraction
kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The
following PCR primers were used. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the primers were supplied with the Rever Tra Ace-a
kit. For MRP1, a forward primer was designated as 5¶-CACAGTGGGGATGCTGGCCAGCAACAC-3¶ and a reverse primer as 5¶-TGAGTCCCATTCACAGTGGGGTGGTCATC-3¶ based on partial hamster MRP1 data. The
corresponding DNA sequences are expected to be in exon 21 and exon 22,
respectively, based on the mouse genomic DNA. BCRP primers were
designed based on mouse BCRP mRNA and genomic DNA sequences
because no sequence was available for hamster. A forward primer was
designated in exon 4 as 5¶-TAGATGTCTTAGCAGCAAGGAAAG-3¶and a
reverse primer in exon 5 as 5¶-TCATTAAAGAGTTAGGTCTGGAAAAAG-3¶.
All PCRs were carried out in a reaction volume of 20 AL. Individual PCR
conditions were the following: PCR of GAPDH was according to the

www.aacrjournals.org

manufacturer’s protocol. PCR of cDNA used one fifth of the reverse
transcriptase product, Premix ExTaq (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.), and denaturation
at 97jC for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 95jC/30 s, 65jC/1 min, and
72jC/1 min. PCR of 50 ng genomic DNA was carried out using KOD
polymerase (Toyobo) with denaturation at 95jC for 5 min followed by
30 cycles of 95jC/30 s, 65jC/10 s, and 74jC/10 s. PCR of BCRP used one
fifth of the reverse transcriptase cDNA, KOD polymerase, and initial
reaction conditions of 30 cycles of 95jC/20 s, 55jC/10 s, and 74jC/1 s.
Tests were then carried out in which the annealing temperature was
varied between 50jC and 65jC. As a positive control, PCR of 50 ng
genomic DNA was carried out with KOD polymerase and PCR conditions
of denaturation at 95jC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95jC/30 s,
55jC/19 s, and 74jC/5 s. PCR fragments were sequenced using the appropriate primer set to confirm that the band was the target DNA. The
corresponding mouse genomic DNA contains a rather short intron, 627 bp
in MRP1 and 545 bp in BCRP, between each set of primers.
Intracellular localization of doxorubicin. Me32a-T22/L2 and Me32a/
pCMB117 cells (4  104) were plated. Following washing with PBS, cells
were incubated with 20 Amol/L doxorubicin in DMEM/10% FCS for 30 min
and 2 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 was added to the medium and cells were
incubated for 30 min more. After washing with PBS, the cells were observed
with confocal laser microscopy (FV5000, Olympus Corp.).
To verify the intracellular localization of doxorubicin, the cells were
incubated with 30 Amol/L doxorubicin for 1 h, washed with PBS, and
incubated with 5 Amol/L of the Golgi marker C6-NBD-ceramide in PBS at
4jC for 30 min (16). Following rinsing with ice-cold DMEM, the cells were
incubated at 37jC for 30 min in fresh medium, washed with PBS, and
observed with confocal laser microscopy (LeicaTCS4D, Leica; ref. 17). To
assess the effect of brefeldin A or monensin, CHO-K1 and CHO/pCMB117
cells were incubated with 30 Amol/L doxorubicin in DMEM/10% FCS and
for 30 min at 37jC in the presence of 5 Amol/L brefeldin A or 3 Amol/L
monensin. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 5 Amol/L
C6-NBD-ceramide and observed with the confocal laser microscopy
(LeicaTCS4D).
Quantification of doxorubicin and SN-38 accumulation in parental
and ATP7A-expressing cells. To measure doxorubicin accumulation,
subconfluent cells in 12-well plates were incubated with 30 Amol/L cold and
0.1 Amol/L [14C]doxorubicin for 1 h at 37jC. Following washing with icecold PBS, the cells were solubilized in 10 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS and the incorporated
radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter (15). To
assess the effect of ATP deficit on doxorubicin accumulation, the cells were
preincubated with 1 mmol/L 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) in PBS for 30 min and
then incubated with the doxorubicin-containing medium in the continued
presence of 1 mmol/L DNP for 1 h. The incorporated radioactivity was then
determined as described above.
To measure intracellular SN-38 accumulation, 2.0  105 CHO-K1 cells
and 3.0  105 CHO/pCMB117 cells were plated on a 60-mm dish. In the next
day, the cells were incubated with 1 Amol/L SN-38 in fresh medium for 1 h.
Following washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were harvested with a rubber
scraper, washed with cold PBS, and counted with a hemocytometer.
Methanol (1 mL) was added before homogenization with five strokes of a
syringe with a 27-gauge needle. Insoluble debris was removed by
centrifugation. The supernatant was evaporated with a concentrator. The
dried pellets were resolved with 75 AL distilled water and 150 AL
acetonitorile and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
using a modification of a previously described procedure (18).
Measurement of efflux of doxorubicin and SN-38 in the parental
and ATP7A-expressing cells. To estimate the efflux rate of doxorubicin,
subconfluent cells in 12-well plates were incubated in fresh DMEM
containing 10% FCS for 1 h and then with 30 Amol/L cold plus 0.1 Amol/L
[14C]doxorubicin for 1 h at 37jC. After washing with PBS, the cells were
incubated with medium without drugs for the indicated times at 37jC. The
radioactivity of solubilized cells was determined as described above.
To examine the efflux rate of SN-38, 3.0  105 CHO-K1 and CHO/
pCMB117 cells in six-well plates were incubated in 5 mL medium for 24 h.
After washing with PBS, 4 Amol/L for CHO-K1 cells and 7 Amol/L for CHO/

pCMB117 cells, SN-38 was added to the medium for 1 h followed by washing
with PBS. The cells were further incubated in fresh medium without SN-38
for the indicated times at 37jC and the harvested cells were counted. The
SN-38 content of the cells was determined as described above.
Vesicle uptake of SN-38. Vesicle uptake of SN-38 was measured by a
rapid filtration technique as described previously (18, 19). Nonspecific
binding of drugs to the filters was determined in the absence of membrane
vesicles. Values for membrane vesicle uptake were obtained by subtracting
values in the absence of ATP from those in the presence of ATP.
Immunohistochemical study. The expression of ATP7A, MRP1, and
BCRP in cancer cells and normal adjacent epithelia was examined with
immunohistochemical method as described previously (20). Evaluation of
immunohistostaining of three different (100 magnification) visual fields
was carried out by two investigators independently. Specimens containing
>30% immunoreactive cancer cells were judged as positive and those
containing <10% as negative.
HDRA, ex vivo drug resistance assay. HDRA was done by SRL, Inc. as
described previously (21). Briefly, four pieces of minced tumors (f0.5 mm
in diameter) were placed on a collagen sponge gel in a 24-well plate and
incubated with RPMI 1640 containing 20% FCS for 7 days in the presence or
absence of 20 Ag/mL CDDP or 0.4 Ag/mL SN-38. After adding HBSS
containing collagenase and 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS to each well, the plates
were incubated for 8 h. Following extraction with DMSO, the absorbance of
the solution was read at 540 nm. The inhibitory index was calculated
according to the following formula: inhibitory index (%) = (1
mean
absorbance of treated tumor / g) / mean absorbance of untreated tumor / g.
Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were analyzed by the
Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.
Significance levels given are those for the two-tailed Student’s t test.

Results
Expression of ATP7A in ATP7A-transfected and parental
cells. To examine the ability of ATP7A to modulate cellular
resistance to anticancer agents as well as to copper, we used CHOK1 cells and established fibroblasts from Menkes disease patients
that had been transfected with ATP7A (9, 10). We first compared
the protein expression of ATP7A by immunoblotting. All of the
transfected cells (i.e., CHO/615D, CHO/pCMB117, and Me32a/
pCMB117) expressed ATP7A, whereas weak or no ATP7A was
detectable in the corresponding parental cells. Among the transfected cells, CHO/pCMB117 cells exhibited the highest expression
of ATP7A (Fig. 1A).
Effects of ATP7A on cellular resistance to anticancer drugs.
We next determined whether transfected ATP7A could confer
resistance to copper or CDDP toxicity using the cell survival MTT
assay. CHO/615D and Me32a/pCMB117 cells were much less
resistant to copper [relative resistances (RR) of 0.95 and 1.28,
respectively] than to CDDP (RRs of 2.4 and 2.4, respectively;
Table 1). These data are consistent with previous reports that cells
that express ATP7A at a moderate level are resistant to CDDP but
not to copper (8, 22). In contrast, CHO/pCMB117, which expresses
a high level of ATP7A, showed a higher resistance to copper
(RR, 3.85) than to CDDP (RR, 2.5; Table 1).
To examine if ATP7A might also confer resistance to anticancer
agents, we compared the sensitivity of ATP7A-expressing cells and
their respective parental cells to anticancer agents using the MTT
assay. Unexpectedly, all of the ATP7A-expressing cells were highly
resistant to SN-38, Taxol, and vincristine. For example, CHO/
pCMB117 cells showed a 147.31-, 324.95-, and 678.37-fold enhanced
resistance to these agents compared with the parental cells.
ATP7A-expressing cells were also moderately resistant to VP-16
and doxorubicin (20.17- and 10.30-fold enhanced resistance in
CHO/pCMB117 cells) and were also resistant to CPT-11 and

Me32a-T22/2L, and Me32a/pCMB117 cells and membrane vesicles (20 Ag)
of each control cells (right lane ) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and
ATP7A, P-gp, MRP1, BCRP, and MRP4 proteins were detected with specific
antibodies. Positive control cells were KB-C2, KB/MRP, and MCF-7/AdVp3000
cells for P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP, respectively. Quantified indices of ATP7A and
MRP4 expression level were indicated under each band. B, mRNA expression
of MRP1 (top ), BCRP (middle ), and GAPDH used as a control (bottom ) was
measured by RT-PCR. Amplification of cDNA and genomic DNA was carried out
as described in Materials and Methods and detected the bands of 250 bp for
BCRP cDNA, 900 bp for genomic MRP1 , and 700 bp for genomic BCRP . An
amplified band using human BCRP cDNA as template with the same primers and
the representative condition. The sequence of the 203-bp amplified cDNA and
genomic DNA of MRP1 was completely identical to those in the hamster
database. Although the hamster sequence of BCRP was not in the database,
the sequence of the protein-encoding regions of the genomic hamster DNA was
89% identical to those of mouse BCRP (data not shown).

mitoxantron (4.69- and 10.3-fold enhanced resistance in CHO/
pCMB117 cells; Table 1). For all drugs tested, the RR in CHO/
pCMB117 cells was higher than that measured in CHO/615D cells.
Because CHO/pCMB117 cells express the highest ATP7A protein
level, this suggests a correlation between ATP7A expression and
drug resistance.
Expression of transporter proteins in CHO and Me32a cells.
To ensure that the expression of other drug transporters did not
contribute to the observed resistance to drugs in these cells, we
examined the expression level of P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP by
immunoblotting. Neither P-gp, BCRP, nor MRP1 was detected in
these cells by immunoblotting, although high levels of these
proteins could be detected in control cells (Fig. 1A). Because it has
been recently reported that MRP4 is related to resistance to CPT-11
(23), we also examined the expression of MRP4 and found it to be
expressed at a similar level in all the cells tested.
In case that our inability to detect MRP1 or BCRP at the protein
level might be due to an inability of our antibodies to cross-react
with hamster proteins, we further examined the mRNA expression
level of MRP1 and BCRP in CHO cells with semiquantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). MRP1 mRNA expression was slightly
higher in the parental cells than in the ATP7A-transfected cells
(Fig. 1B). BCRP mRNA was not detected in any of the cells,
although we were able to amplify BCRP1 genomic DNAs with these
primers. Thus, the level of expression of these well-known MDR
transporters in the ATP7A-transfected cells is unlikely to contribute
to drug resistance.
Doxorubicin distribution in Me32a-T22/L2 and Me32a/
pCMB117 cells. Because ATP7A seemed to play a role in drug
resistance, we next analyzed potential mechanism(s) by which
ATP7A might modulate drug resistance. It has previously been
shown that the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents depends on their
subcellular localization. We therefore determined if the expression of ATP7A could alter the intracellular distribution of
anticancer drugs using doxorubicin as a model system.
Doxorubicin has an intrinsic red fluorescence that facilitates
observation of its cellular localization. We therefore treated
Me32a/pCMB117 or the parental Me32a-T22/L2 cells with
doxorubicin and then observed its intracellular distribution with

www.aacrjournals.org

confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. In Me32a-T22/L2 cells,
doxorubicin fluorescence was localized predominantly in the
nuclei (Fig. 2A, top). In contrast, in the ATP7A-expressing cells,
doxorubicin was detected as a punctate cytoplasmic distribution
of fluorescence around the nuclei, suggesting that ATP7A could
alter the intracellular localization of doxorubicin (Fig. 2A,
bottom). Because ATP7A is localized mainly in the Golgi
membrane, it seemed likely that the punctate distribution of
doxorubicin that we observed in the ATP7A-expressing cells
reflected colocalization of doxorubicin and ATP7A in the Golgi.
We tested this hypothesis by using C6-NBD-ceramide as a marker
for the Golgi apparatus. In CHO/pCM117 and Me32a/pCMB117
cells, the fluorescence of doxorubicin and C6-NBD-ceramide was
clearly colocalized (Fig. 2B, f and l), whereas in CHO-K1 and
Me32a-T22/L2 cells (Fig. 2B, c and i) it was not. Therefore, one
mechanism by which ATP7A modulates drug resistance seems to
be by relocalization of the drug away from the nucleus, which
would limit its cytotoxicity.
Effect of brefeldin A and monensin on the intracellular
localization of doxorubicin in CHO/pCMB117 cells. To assess
the role of trans-Golgi network of anticancer agents in ATP7Aexpressing cells, we observed the effects of brefeldin A and
monensin on the doxorubicin localization in CHO/pCMB117 cells.
Brefeldin A partially and monensin almost completely change the
doxorubicin distribution from the Golgi to the nuclei (Fig. 2C).
These data strongly suggested that the function of trans-Golgi
network is involved in the doxorubicin localization in the Golgi of
ATP7A-expressing cells.
Effect of ATP7A on the intracellular accumulation and
efflux of doxorubicin and SN-38. A second mechanism by which
ATP7A might mediate drug resistance is by an effect on the
intracellular accumulation and efflux of the drug. To explore this
possibility, the effect of ATP7A on cellular accumulation of
doxorubicin and SN-38 was examined. CHO-K1 and CHO/
pCMB117 cells were incubated in medium containing [14C]doxorubicin or SN-38 for 60 min and the level of doxorubicin or SN-38 in
cell lysates was then measured.
Intracellular amounts of doxorubicin (166.9 nmol/L/104 cells)
and SN-38 (79.5 ng/102 cells) in CHO/pCMB117 cells were

significantly lower than those (229.7 nmol/L/104 cells and
151.5 ng/102 cells, respectively) in the parental CHO-K1 cells
(Fig. 3A and B). This defect of doxorubicin accumulation was
attenuated with 1 mmol/L DNP, an uncoupler of oxidative
phosphorylation. These data strongly suggest that the decreased
doxorubicin accumulation in CHO/pCMB117 cells is due to an
ATP-dependent doxorubicin transporting activity of ATP7A.
We next determined if the decreased accumulation of
doxorubicin and SN-38 in ATP7A-expressing cells was due to an
enhanced active efflux of doxorubicin and SN-38. We therefore
compared the efflux of [14C]doxorubicin or SN-38 in parental
CHO-K1 and CHO/pCMB117 cells by measurement of the cellular
level of doxorubicin or SN-38 over a period of 60 min. The efflux
rate of doxorubicin and SN-38 from CHO/pCMB117 cells was
enhanced compared with the efflux rate from CHO-K1 cells
(Fig. 4A and B). Thus, at 60 min, only 48% of doxorubicin and
52.4% of SN-38 were retained within the ATP7A-expressing cells
compared with 78.5% and 72.4%, respectively, retained in the
parental CHO-K1 cells, suggesting that ATP7A could enhance the
cellular efflux of the drugs.

We also examined that the accumulation and efflux of
vincristine and Taxol with [3H]vincristine and [3H]Taxol; however,
we did not find any significant differences of accumulation and
efflux of these drugs between CHO-K1 and CHO/pCMB117 cells.
These data indicate that the accumulation and efflux is not
important for vincristine and Taxol resistance of CHO/pCMB117
cells.
Effect of ATP7A on SN-38 uptake by membrane vesicles. To
determine if ATP7A had a direct effect on SN-38 transport, we
examined SN-38 uptake by membrane vesicles from CHO/
pCMB117 cells and compared it with that of CHO-K1 cells.
Uptake of SN-38 by ATP7A-expressing membrane vesicles was
1.45-fold higher than that of the parental cells at 15 min, strongly
suggesting that ATP7A is directly involved in SN-38 transport
(Fig. 4C).
ATP7A is overexpressed in clinical tumors and its expression is related to SN-38 resistance. Because ATP7A seems to play
a role in resistance to anticancer drugs, this raised the possibility
that it might be a useful target for antitumor therapy. To
determine if ATP7A does play a role in drug resistance in clinical
cancer, we first evaluated the expression of ATP7A in clinical colon
cancer specimens with an immunohistochemical method. ATP7A
was detected in 8 of 34 (23.5%) tumors but not in adjacent normal
epithelial cells (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
These data are consistent with a previous report (2) and suggest
that ATP7A might be aberrantly expressed in cancer cells. We next
tested if ATP7A might correlate with drug resistance in these
tumors. Because CPT-11 and CDDP are frequently used for colon
cancer treatment, we examined drug resistance to these anticancer
agents with HDRA, an ex vivo drug resistance assay. In this assay,
drug resistance is calculated as an inhibitory index, with an
inhibitory index of >50%, indicating sensitivity to anticancer
agents. The average inhibitory indices of ATP7A+ tumors treated
with SN-38 (10.6%) were significantly lower than those of ATP7A
tumors (38.5%; P = 0.009478), but expression of BCRP and MRP1 of
the tumors had no relation with inhibitory indices (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Twelve cases of ATP7A tumors showed inhibitory
indices that were >50%. In contrast, the inhibitory indices of
ATP7A+ tumors were <20% (Supplementary Table S1). On the other
hand, the average inhibitory indices obtained following treatment
with CDDP were similar between ATP7A+ (20.8%) and ATP7A
(27.0%) tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Thus, ATP7A expression
seems to contribute to specific drug resistance of clinical cancer
specimens.

Discussion
This article sheds new light on the potential cellular functions of
ATP7A. The lower cellular resistance to copper than to CDDP in
cells that express ATP7A at a moderate level (CHO/615D and
Me32a/pCMB117 cells) is consistent with previous studies (8, 9, 22).
In our study, ATP7A-expressing cells were only slightly more
resistant to CDDP than the parental cells. This is in contrast to a
previous study in which expression of the ATP7A protein was
increased in three CDDP-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines that
were 5.7- to 8.1-fold more resistant to CDDP than the parental cells
(3). These differences might reflect the different types of cells used
in each study.
Unexpectedly, the CHO cells expressing ATP7A were highly
resistant to several anticancer agents, such as SN-38, vincristine,
and Taxol (Table 1). This resistance could not be attributed to the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

presence of other well-known MDR proteins, as we did not detect
the expression of BCRP and P-gp and could not detect any
difference of expression of MRP1 or MRP4 between the ATP7Aexpressing cells and the parental cells (Fig. 1).
That the drug resistance observed in ATP7A-expressing cells is
due to ATP7A is further suggested by the fact that the drug
resistance profile of ATP7A-expressing cells differs from that of
other drug-resistant, protein-expressing cells. Whereas ATP7A
are highly resistant to both Taxol and SN-38, P-gp–expressing
cells are not resistant to SN-38, and MRP1-expressing cells are
only resistant to Taxol at a low level. BCRP-expressing cells
are extremely resistant to mitoxantron but are only slightly
resistant to Taxol (13). However, both CHO/pCMB117 and Me32a/
pCMB117 cells were highly resistant to Taxol (RRs, 324.95
and 93.39, respectively) but only moderately resistant to
mitoxantron (RRs, 10.30 and 4.16, respectively). Thus, ATP7Aexpressing cells were resistant to various agents with different
chemical structure and molecular targets that are different
from the spectra of structures and targets reported for other
MDR cells. These data indicate that the spectrum of anticancer
agents to which ATP7A confers resistance is unique among
MDR cells.
We also investigated potential mechanisms by which ATP7A
might induce drug resistance. We showed that doxorubicin was
preferentially localized to the Golgi apparatus in ATP7A-expressing
cells instead of to the nuclei that is its localization in the parental
cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, ATP7A expression led to increased
uptake of SN-38 by membrane vesicles (Fig. 4C). These data suggest
that these agents are transported to the Golgi apparatus together
with ATP7A. Furthermore, they are consistent with previous
studies of fluorescein-labeled cisplatin (F-DDP) in suggesting that
compartmentalization of doxorubicin and SN-38 within the Golgi
apparatus is one mechanism whereby ATP7A modulates drug
resistance (22).
ATP7A has been implicated in the efflux of copper across the
serosal membrane of gut epithelial cells to serum, and the
intestinal cells of the Menkes disease patients show a decreased
efflux of copper (4, 5). Our study provides further evidence for a role
for ATP7A in the efflux of specific molecules from cells. Thus, the
efflux rate of doxorubicin and SN-38 from the CHO/pCMB117 cells
was enhanced compared with that from CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4B),
indicating that enhancement of drug efflux is one of the
mechanisms whereby ATP7A modulates drug resistance. The lower
rate of efflux mediated by ATP7A-expressing cells compared with
that mediated by the plasma membrane transporters MRP1 and Pgp is likely due to the dependence of ATP7A-mediated transport on
the vesicle transport system. It is still unclear whether all
anticancer drugs are transported in a similar manner as copper
by ATP7A. A second secretory pathway has been suggested to
mediate the efflux of F-DDP and may also contribute to the efflux
of SN-38 and doxorubicin (24).
CHO/pCMB117 cells were highly resistant to vincristine and
Taxol; however, the accumulation and efflux of those agents did not
increase. Because ATP7A-expressing CHO/pCMB117 cells have the
well-developed Golgi apparatus as shown in Fig. 2B and Golgi
apparatus is closely related to microtubules, the overexpression of
ATP7A might have some effects on the microtubules, the target
molecule of vincristine and Taxol, whereby ATP7A enhances drug
resistance.
Brefeldin A partially and monensin almost completely change
the distribution of doxorubicin in CHO/pCMB117 cells. These data

ATP7A and Drug Resistance and Clinical Drug Resistance

strongly suggested that the trans-Golgi network has an important
role of ATP7A-related drug resistance. Brefeldin A disturbs the
protein traffic from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus
and changes the distribution of ATP7A to a juxtanuclear structure;
however, its effect on the function of ATP7A is not clear (25).
Monensin was reported to resensitize the doxorubicin-resistant
cells with disturbing of acidification of the organelles (26).
Although vesicular acidification is an important factor of the drug
resistance against weak base chemotherapeutic agents, the precise
mechanisms to trap the drugs into the vesicles are unknown.
ATP7A could be a candidate as an uptake transporter of these
anticancer agents.
ATP7A is expressed in normal small intestinal cells but not in
the colon. However, we found that 23.5% of clinical colon tumors
aberrantly express ATP7A and that the expression of ATP7A in
cancer cells is significantly correlated to the inhibitory index values
obtained with HDRA. HDRA is a useful ex vivo drug sensitivity
assay because of the good correlation between the inhibitory
indices obtained with HDRA and the clinical outcome after
chemotherapy (21, 27). Our findings strongly suggested that ATP7A
expression is correlated to CPT-11 resistance, but not to CDDP
resistance, in clinical cancer cells. This result partly accounts for
the fact that ATP7A-expressing cells were more resistant to SN-38
than to CDDP in vitro. However, it does not necessarily mean that
ATP7A is not important in the CDDP resistance of colon cancer
cells because none of the ATP7A+ tumors were judged to be
sensitive (inhibitory index, >50%) to CDDP, whereas 3 cases of
ATP7A tumors out of 34 cases were sensitive to CDDP
(Supplementary Table S1). Thus, ATP7A expression might be only
one of several factors contributing to CDDP resistance in colon
cancers. Evaluation of ATP7A expression in cancer cells may be a
useful back-up method for the prediction of drug sensitivity to SN38 because not all clinical samples are suitable for HDRA, which
depends on the quality and quantity of the specimen. Furthermore,

HDRA cannot be applied to retrospective studies. About CPT-11
resistance, we are now collecting more clinical specimens and
investigating the expression of other resistance relating transporters in colon cancers.
Recent evidence indicates that ATP7A is up-regulated in
pancreatic cancer compared with chronic pancreatitis (28) and
that ATP7A and the copper-containing enzyme lysyl oxidase are
more highly expressed in invasive breast cancer cell lines than in
noninvasive lines (29). Thus, ATP7A expression might be related to
the malignant phenotype in addition to its role in MDR. A further
follow-up study will be necessary to elucidate the answer to this
question.
In summary, we found that ATP7A is important not only for
copper homeostasis but also for drug resistance to anticancer
agents. Because ATP7A is more broadly expressed than ATP7B,
ATP7A expression could be a more common cause of drug
resistance in clinical cancers than ATP7B. Furthermore, these
findings suggested that ATP7A might have an important role in the
pharmacokinetics of other agents beside anticancer drugs. Further
study is needed to elucidate the correlation between ATP7A
expression and clinical prognosis and the effects of ATP7A on the
trans-Golgi network traffic and pharmacokinetics of other drugs.
