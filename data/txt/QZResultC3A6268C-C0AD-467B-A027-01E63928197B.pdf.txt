HER2 and Breast Cancer Stem Cells: More than Meets
the Eye
Hasan Korkaya and Max S. Wicha

Abstract
The development of HER2 targeting agents has dramatically altered the natural history of HER2-positive breast
cancer and is often cited as a prime example of the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapy. Emerging data
suggest that the remarkable clinical efﬁcacy of these agents may be related to their ability to target the breast
cancer stem cell (CSC) population. A new study suggests that the regulation of BCSCs by HER2 may extend to
breast cancers that do not display HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. In these tumors, HER2 is selectively expressed in the
CSC population, and this expression is regulated by the tumor microenvironment. In mouse models, trastuzumab
blocked growth of these HER2-negative tumors when administered in the adjuvant setting but had no effect on
established tumors. These studies provide a potential biologic explanation for retrospective analysis of clinical
trials, which surprisingly suggest that the clinical beneﬁts of adjuvant trastuzumab may extend to women
currently classiﬁed as HER2-negative. In addition to having signiﬁcant implications for breast cancer therapy,
these studies suggest the need to reevaluate the role of HER2 in regulating CSCs in other tumor types.
Furthermore, these studies suggest that effective adjuvant therapies may need to target the CSC population.

Breast Cancer: A Poster Child for Molecularly
Targeted Therapeutics
The therapy of breast cancer provides one of the best
examples of the clinical beneﬁts of molecularly targeted therapeutics. Development of these therapies has resulted from
realization that the spectrum of breast cancer encompasses
distinct molecular subtypes, which have characteristic gene
expression proﬁles, natural histories, and which respond to
different therapies. These molecular classiﬁcations also reﬂect
major drivers of these cancer subtypes including the steroid
hormone receptors, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone
receptor (PR), and the growth factor receptor HER2. The
development of reliable hormone receptor and HER2 assays
has led to the classiﬁcation of breast cancers as ER-positive
(ERþ), PR-positive (PRþ), HER2þ, or triple-negative. The use of
hormonal therapy for ERþ disease and HER2-targeted agents
for HER2þ disease represents one of the greatest advances in
clinical oncology and illustrates the tremendous potential of
molecularly targeted therapeutics. In fact, the use of hormonal
agents and HER2 targeting agents in the adjuvant setting
accounts for a major portion of the signiﬁcant decrease in
breast cancer mortality over the past 20 years (1, 2).

The Plot Thickens
Despite the success of hormonal and HER2 targeting agents,
many women with breast cancer, who receive these agents in
the adjuvant setting, still relapse. Furthermore, almost all
women with advanced breast cancer develop resistance to
these targeted therapies, as well as to chemotherapy, and as a
result, metastatic breast cancer remains incurable. The selection of therapy based on molecular subtype of breast cancer
assumes that cell populations within an individual tumor are
homogeneous and, thus, will uniformly respond to these
treatments. This assumption has been challenged by the cancer
stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, which posits that many cancers,
including breast cancer, are hierarchically organized and driven by a population of cells that displays stem cell properties.
Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that these CSCs
mediate tumor metastasis and by virtue of their relative
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to
treatment relapse (3, 4). Breast CSCs can be identiﬁed by virtue
of their expression of marker proteins such as CD44þ/CD24
or aldehyde dehydrogenase (5, 6). CSCs, which constitute a
small subset of cells in human breast cancers, give rise to other
CSCs through the process of self-renewal, as well as generate
the non–stem cell populations forming the tumor bulk.
Although CSCs and bulk tumor cells may share genetic signatures, they display distinct gene expression patterns by
virtue of epigenetic regulation. As a result, CSCs and bulk cell
populations within an individual tumor may be driven by
distinct pathways. This suggests that effective therapy may
require selective targeting of these distinct cell populations.
This level of molecular heterogeneity is superimposed upon
genetic clonal heterogeneity generated by genetic instability.

Korkaya and Wicha

The HER family of growth factors plays an important role in
breast development and mammary carcinogenesis. Although
HER2 itself has no known ligand, it forms heterodimers with
ligand-activated EGF receptor (EGFR), HER3, and HER4. Previous studies using the mouse models of conditional HER2
knockout in the mammary gland have shown that HER2 is
required for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis (7).
The HER2 gene is ampliﬁed in approximately 20% of human
breast cancers, a molecular subtype associated with an aggressive clinical course with early development of metastasis. The
development of HER2 targeting agents such as trastuzumab
has led to a dramatic alteration in the natural history of this
disease (8). Preclinical studies, as well as clinical trials, have
shown that in women with advanced breast cancer, the clinical
beneﬁt of HER2-targeted therapies are limited to women
whose breast cancers display HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. This
observation has led to the routine testing of breast cancer
samples for HER2 overexpression by immunochemistry and
FISH (9). On the basis of the studies in advanced breast cancer
showing that the potentiation of tumor regression by HER2
targeting agents was limited to HER2þ breast cancers, entry
into adjuvant trials using these agents was limited to this
patient population. These adjuvant trials showed that addition
of the HER2 blocking agent trastuzumab to cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in a remarkable 50% reduction in disease
recurrence compared with patients receiving chemotherapy
alone (10–12). However, the conventional wisdom that only
HER2þ patients beneﬁt from adjuvant trastuzumab was challenged by a study published by Paik and colleagues in the New
England Journal of Medicine in 2008 (13). In this retrospective
study, clinical samples accrued to NSABP B31, a pivotal trastuzumab adjuvant trial were reanalyzed for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation in a central laboratory. This reanalysis identiﬁed 174
cases which although originally reported as HER2þ actually
lacked HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. Surprisingly, analysis of outcome data revealed that these HER2 patients beneﬁted as
much from adjuvant trastuzumab as did patients whose
tumors displayed HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. These ﬁndings
were conﬁrmed in a similar analysis from an independent
trastuzumab adjuvant study (14). Although provocative, these
studies are limited by their retrospective nature, and a randomized prospective phase III trial, NSABP B47, is currently in
progress to determine whether the clinical beneﬁts of adjuvant
trastuzumab extend to women whose tumors do not display
HER2 ampliﬁcation. Although the molecular mechanisms that
might account for the clinical efﬁcacy of adjuvant trastuzumab
in women with HER2 breast cancer are not known, recent
preclinical ﬁndings by our group suggest that this clinical
observation may be explained by the CSC model.

HER2 and Breast Cancer Stem Cells
Several lines of evidence indicate that HER2 is an important
regulator of the CSC population in HER2þ breast cancers (13).
We previously showed that HER2 overexpression increases and
HER2 blockade decreases the CSC population in breast cancer
cell lines and mouse xenografts (15). Furthermore, in human
breast cancers, there is a correlation between HER2 ampliﬁcation and CSC frequency as assessed by expression of the

3490

breast CSC marker ALDH-1 (5). In contrast with cytotoxic
chemotherapy, neoadjuvant HER2 blockade reduces the CSC
population, resulting in a signiﬁcantly increased complete
pathologic response rate compared with chemotherapy alone
(16). In addition, in contrast with chemotherapy, administration of the EGFR/HER2 blocker lapatinib in the neoadjuvant
setting reduced the breast CSC population (4). In a new study
published in Cancer Research, we show that HER2 also plays an
important role in regulating the CSC population in luminal
breast cancers that do not display HER2 ampliﬁcation and
therefore are currently classiﬁed as HER2. In these tumors,
HER2 is selectively expressed in and drives the CSC population.
As CSCs constitute only a small fraction of the total tumor
population, analysis of whole tumors masks this measurement
of HER2 expression. A recent report that HER2-expressing cells
in luminal HER2 breast cancers are radiation-resistant provides further evidence for such a model. Our studies also raise
questions about current clinical practices for HER2 assessment. Tumors are routinely evaluated by immunohistochemistry on a scale from 0 to 3þ, with the latter being considered
HER2þ. Those that are 2þ are further examined by FISH and if
HER2 is ampliﬁed they are also considered positive. FISH
analysis of HER2 gene ampliﬁcation is considered to be the
gold standard for classiﬁcation of breast cancers as HER2þ a
designation that has dictated treatment selection.
Our studies suggest that contrary to this dichotomous
model, HER2 expression in breast tumors follows a distribution related to molecular subtype, with luminal tumors
expressing an intermediate level of HER2 compared with
claudin-low/basal (low) and HER2-ampliﬁed (high; ref. 17).
These data are consistent with previous reports showing a
bimodal association of clinical outcomes with HER2 expression levels (19, 20). Those studies indicated that when HER2
expression was quantitated with ELISA or immunoﬂuorescent in situ assays, very low and very high HER2 protein
levels in patients with breast cancer had a poorer outcome
than those with intermediate expression. Consistent with
our ﬁndings, the HER2-low group was associated with triplenegative, the HER2-high group with HER2þ and the intermediate HER2 group with luminal ERþ breast cancer. Our
preclinical studies predict that women with luminal breast
cancer in which HER2 and the CSC marker ALDH1 are
coexpressed in the same cells will beneﬁt most from adjuvant trastuzumab. This hypothesis can be directly tested in
prospective clinical trials such as NSABP B47.

Regulation of HER2 Expression by the Tumor
Microenvironment
If HER2 expression in CSCs does not require HER2 gene
ampliﬁcation, what regulates HER2 expression in these cells?
We show that the bone microenvironment at sites of bone
metastasis is able to induce expression of HER2 in a process
regulated by RANK ligand, which is produced by bone osteoblasts. It has previously been shown that normal breast stem
cells are regulated by RANK ligand, which is produced in
response to progesterone elevation during pregnancy (21,
22). In triple-negative basal breast cancers, it has been shown
that RANK ligand produced by bone osteoblasts is capable of

stimulating self-renewal of CSCs through activation of NF-kB
(7). Our studies expand upon this concept by showing that
RANK ligand is also able to regulate CSCs in luminal breast
cancers through induction of HER2 expression (23). The RANK
ligand inhibitory antibody denosumab is currently approved
for the treatment of bone metastasis in breast and other
cancers. Ongoing randomized clinical trials are in progress to
determine whether administration of denosumab in the adjuvant setting reduces recurrence in women with early-stage
breast cancer. The ability of RANK ligand to regulate CSC
populations in bone micrometastasis suggests a potential
mechanism that might produce clinical beneﬁt in this setting.
Through a comparison of HER2 protein expression in patient
biopsies from primary luminal breast tumors and bone metastasis, we showed a signiﬁcant increase in HER2 protein expression in the bone metastasis compared with matched primary
tumors. Furthermore, as indicated by FISH analysis, this
increase in HER2 expression was not due to the selection of
clones of HER2-ampliﬁed cells (17). These observations are
consistent with those from previous studies that reported a
signiﬁcant discordance in HER2 protein expression among
primary tumors, circulating tumor cells, and metastatic lesions
(9, 24). A number of these studies used FISH to assess HER2
gene copy number and thus may have missed regulation of
HER2 protein expression by the tumor microenvironment.
However, a recent report showed that 89% of women with
HER2 breast cancer had circulating tumor cells (CTC) that
expressed HER2 protein. Furthermore, trastuzumab decreased
recurrence in these patients, an effect associated with reduction in HER2-expressing CTCs (25).

Interaction of HER2 and Other Signaling
Pathways in the Regulation of Breast CSCs
We have previously reported that HER2 regulates breast
CSCs through a cell intrinsic process involving signaling
through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and Wnt
pathways (26). In contrast with the adjuvant setting, the
majority of patients with advanced HER2þ breast cancer
develop resistance to trastuzumab. Many of these trastuzumab-resistant patients respond to newer HER2 targeting
drugs such as pertuzumab or the trastuzumab drug conjugate T-DM1. Furthermore, immunotherapeutic approaches
including T-cell therapy targeting HER2 have been developed (27). In addition, loss of expression of the tumor
suppressor gene PTEN is frequently associated with resistance to HER2 targeting agents. In preclinical models, we
showed that PTEN knockdown in HER2þ breast cancer cells
generates trastuzumab-resistant CSCs through activation of
an inﬂammatory loop mediated by NF-kB and interleukin
(IL)-6 (28). It has been proposed that the trastuzumab
resistance in HER2þER (basal) compared with HER2þERþ
(luminal) breast tumors may be related to CSC regulatory
pathways (29). In addition, recent studies have shown that
HER2-activating mutations may contribute to trastuzumab
resistance (30). HER2 may also interact with other CSC
regulatory pathways. For example, it has been recently
shown that in HER2þ breast cancers HER2 interacts with
CXCR1, a receptor for the cytokine IL-8 (31), which has been

www.aacrjournals.org

shown to be selectively expressed in breast CSCs (32). The
Notch pathway, another regulator of breast CSCs, regulates
HER2 expression (33, 34). Together, these studies suggest
that multiple cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic pathways,
including HER2, interact to regulate breast CSCs. These
pathways provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention, as illustrated in Fig. 1. A number of early-stage clinical
trials targeting these CSC regulatory pathways are in
progress.

HER2 and CSCs in Other Tumor Types
The demonstration that HER2 regulates breast CSCs in the
absence of gene ampliﬁcation suggests the possibility that
similar signaling pathways may exist in other tumor types.
Indeed, it has been recently shown in hormone-refractory
prostate cancer that these CSCs are regulated by a pathway
involving a6b4 integrin, which ampliﬁes signaling through the
HER2 and c-Met pathways (30). HER2 has also been reported to
be expressed in a number of other solid malignancies, including those of the bladder and ovary (35). In these tumors,
expression of HER2 protein generally occurs in the absence
of gene ampliﬁcation. Whether HER2 regulates CSCs and thus
whether HER2 blockade will be a useful clinical strategy in
these tumor types remains to be determined. It will be important to consider the CSC model in the design of clinical trials to
assess the efﬁcacy of HER2 blockade in these tumors. Trials
using tumor regression as a measure of efﬁcacy may miss
important effects of HER2 blockade on CSC populations.
Lessons learned from HER2-targeted therapies in breast cancer may prove useful in designing clinical trials for these other
cancers.

Implications for Development of Adjuvant
Therapies
Although HER2-targeted therapies have shown clinical beneﬁt in breast cancer in both advanced and adjuvant settings,
the use of adjuvant trastuzumab has had the greatest impact
on breast cancer mortality, reducing tumor recurrence by
approximately 50%. Because the natural history of HER2þ
breast cancer includes a propensity for early metastasis, the
likelihood of cure for patients who remain disease free after 5
years is great. This raises the intriguing possibility that effective
targeting of CSCs in the adjuvant setting may have similar
dramatic effects in other cancer types. If the lessons learned
from development of HER2-targeted therapies in breast cancer
apply to other tumor types, we may need to alter the current
paradigm for development of adjuvant cancer therapies. This
paradigm selects agents based on their ability to cause regression of advanced tumors. These agents are then administered
in the adjuvant setting after removal of the primary tumor. The
CSC model calls this strategy into question because regression
of advanced tumors largely reﬂects effects on bulk tumor
populations whereas growth of tumors from microscopic foci
at metastatic sites may be mediated by CSCs. This model posits
that only CSCs possess sufﬁcient self-renewal capacity to form
clinically signiﬁcant macrometastasis from these micrometastatic foci. Because CSC and bulk tumor populations may be
driven by different pathways, it will be important to use agents
