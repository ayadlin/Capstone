Abstract
Targeting the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl is an
attractive therapeutic strategy in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) and in Bcr-Abl–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Whereas imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine
kinase, is now used in frontline therapy for CML, secondgeneration inhibitors of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase such as
nilotinib or dasatinib have been developed for the treatment
of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. In the
current study, we generated nilotinib-resistant cell lines and
investigated their mechanism of resistance. Overexpression
of BCR-ABL and multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) were
found among the investigated mechanisms. We showed that
nilotinib is a substrate of the multidrug resistance gene
product, P-glycoprotein, using verapamil or PSC833 to block
binding. Up-regulated expression of p53/56 Lyn kinase, both at
the mRNA and protein level, was found in one of the resistant
cell lines and Lyn silencing by small interfering RNA restored
sensitivity to nilotinib. Moreover, failure of nilotinib treatment was accompanied by an increase of Lyn mRNA expression in patients with resistant CML. Two Src kinase inhibitors
(PP1 and PP2) partially removed resistance but did not significantly inhibit Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast,
dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, inhibited
the phosphorylation of both BCR-ABL and Lyn, and induced
apoptosis of the Bcr-Abl cell line overexpressing p53/56 Lyn.
Such mechanisms of resistance are close to those observed
in imatinib-resistant cell lines and emphasize the critical role
of Lyn in nilotinib resistance. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9809–16]

Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the
presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (22q ) that results
from a t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocation (1, 2). Twenty-five
percent of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) in adults are also
characterized by this translocation. The Ph chromosome contains
a BCR-ABL hybrid gene, the molecular hallmark of CML and
Ph-positive ALL (3). BCR-ABL encodes an oncogenic fusion protein

of 190, 210, or 230 kDa, depending on the breakpoint on the BCR
gene. The unifying feature of all these Bcr-Abl fusion proteins is
their deregulated protein tyrosine kinase activity that is responsible
for leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo (4, 5). Targeting the tyrosine
kinase activity of Bcr-Abl is an attractive therapeutic strategy in
CML or in BCR-ABL–positive ALL that has recently found success
with the development of new drugs such as tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. Imatinib mesylate (previously known as STI571) is a
Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor that competes with ATP for
binding to the Abl kinase domain and stabilizes the protein in its
closed, inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting its activity (6, 7).
The impressive effects of imatinib in CML have been clinically
demonstrated and confirmed in several large trials (8), and now
imatinib is the common treatment of CML in chronic phase.
However, imatinib resistance, which was predicted by previous
in vitro studies, is now a well-recognized problem, particularly in
the advanced phase of the disease. One of the main mechanisms of
resistance in patients with CML is mutation in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine
kinase domain. Nilotinib and dasatinib, the second-generation
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been developed to override the
phenomenon (9, 10).
In an attempt to study the potential mechanism of resistance to
nilotinib, we generated nilotinib-resistant cells from different Phpositive cell lines (K562, AR230, and LAMA84). Characterization of
nilotinib-resistance mechanisms identified Bcr-Abl and/or multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpression. In addition,
up-regulated expression of the Src family kinase, p53/56 Lyn, was
detected in nilotinib-resistant K562 cells. Silencing of p53/56 Lyn by
small interfering RNA (siRNA) in nilotinib-resistant K562 cells
restored their sensitivity to nilotinib. Finally, we investigated Lyn
expression by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR in nilotinibresistant patients. Our data suggest that BCR-ABL–positive cells
can evade the inhibitory effect of nilotinib by several mechanisms,
similar to those observed with imatinib.

Cancer Research
Cell lines. Three BCR-ABL–positive human cell lines were used in this
study: K562, LAMA84, and AR230. Nilotinib-resistant cell lines were derived
as previously described for imatinib and designated LAMA84-rn, AR230-rn,
and K562-rn (11). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and
0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin (referred to in this article as ‘‘RF-10’’) at 37jC
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Aliquots were taken at
24-h intervals for assessment of cell viability by trypan blue exclusion
(Sigma Aldrich).
Generation of nilotinib-resistant cell lines in liquid culture. Cell
lines maintained in culture as described above were gradually exposed
to increasing concentrations of nilotinib, at a rate of 0.1-nmol/L increments for every 10 days of culture. After approximately 3 months, sublines of cells growing in 20 nmol/L of nilotinib were maintained
continuously in culture with this dose of the inhibitor. The parental,
sensitive cell lines were maintained in parallel cultures without nilotinib to
be used as controls.
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured by the number
of viable cells using MTS tetrazolium (Cell Titer96 Aqueous, Promega).
Washed cells in RPMI 1640 were plated (104 cells) in quadruplicate into
microtiter-plate wells plus various doses of inhibitors as indicated (imatinib, nilotinib, verapamil, PSC833, PP1, or PP2). The measure of viability
was performed on a 4-day kinetic, and each day, 20 AL of MTS was added
to the wells. After 2 h of incubation at 37jC, the plates were read

in a microplate autoreader (Dynex Technologies) at a 490 nm wavelength.
The mean results of the four-well set are standardized in comparison with
the initial absorbance at day 0. All the experiments were repeated at least
three times.
Lyn silencing. To inhibit Lyn protein expression, 2  106 cells were
washed twice in cold PBS and transfection was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the protocol T03 (Amaxa AG). Cells were
seeded at 2  105/mL in RF-10 for 24 h, after which cells were separated
into two batches and incubated in the absence or in the presence of
20 nmol/L of nilotinib. Aliquots of the culture were harvested daily for
protein expression analysis and measurement of cell viability by triplicate
trypan blue exclusion counts. Experiments were performed no longer than
4 days and were repeated twice. Cell viability is presented as the mean
of the triplicate for one representative experiment.
Western blot analysis. Protein lysates were prepared according to
Kabarowski and colleagues (12). Protein concentration was measured by the
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and the lysates were stored at
80jC. Approximately 25 Ag of proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE
gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) by
semidry electrophoretic transfer, probed with individual antibodies and
visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Perkin-Elmer).
For immunoprecipitation of Lyn, 400 Ag of protein lysates were precleared
with 30 AL of 50% slurry protein A–sepharose by incubation for 1 h at 4jC.
After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 2 Ag of Lyn

Lyn Kinase Up-regulated Expression in Nilotinib-Resistant CML

Figure 2. Nilotinib is a substrate of Pgp. Proliferation of the K562 and the Pgp overexpressing K562 (K562 Dox ) cell lines were tested in the presence of increasing
concentrations of nilotinib by the MTS assay (A). Pgp was inhibited by incubation with verapamil (5 Ag/mL) or PSC833 (1 Amol/L). Points, mean of the absorbance
of the four-well set standardized in comparison with the starting absorbance at day 0, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. B, detection

antibody overnight and then incubated for 1 h with 30 AL of protein
A–sepharose. After three washes with lysis buffer, the pellet of protein
A–sepharose was solubilized with SDS loading buffer and samples were
resolved as described above. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as
described (13).
Patients and BCR-ABL or Lyn quantification. Seven CML patients in
chronic phase (n = 2) or in accelerated phase (n = 5; two males, five females)
with Ph chromosome and BCR-ABL–positive CML following the failure of
imatinib or dasatinib were investigated. The duration of therapy was 3 to
36 months, and all patients were analyzed at the beginning or before
nilotinib and under treatment at the moment of failure. Resistance was
defined by progression or absence of hematologic and cytogenetic response.
To assess molecular responses, total RNA was extracted from peripheral
blood cells and BCR-ABL transcript levels were quantified and normalized
to endogenous Abl using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR,
according to recommendations recently proposed for harmonization of
results and as we have already reported (11). Quantitative real-time reversetranscriptase PCR to amplify LYN transcripts was carried out on the same
cDNA using a forward primer 5¶-AAGTTGGTGAAAAGGCTTGG-3¶ and a
reverse primer 5¶-GCCACCTTGGTACTGTTGTTA-3¶ from LYN gene in the
Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL#60, MGB probe) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics). With a serial 10-fold dilution series
for cDNA from a patient’s sample, the assay was found to be linear over at
least five orders of magnitude (slope, 3.414; intercept, 35,81). Expression of
relative quantification was performed by using GUS as endogenous control
as previously described (14). Analysis was done by comparative Ct method
giving the amount of target normalized to the endogenous reference and
relative to the same pool of peripheral blood lymphocytes as the calibrator.
For K562 cell lines, LYN gene expression was measured using the method
described above.
Statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate differences between means; differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Generation of nilotinib-resistant cell lines. Ph-positive cell
lines (AR230, LAMA84, and K562) were grown in the presence of
increasing concentrations of nilotinib over a period of 3 months to
generate resistant cell lines. Resistance was defined as the capacity to survive in the continuous presence of the highest dose of
nilotinib. Indeed, the final concentration of 20 nmol/L of nilotinib
was chosen in relation to the dose administered for CML patient
treatment. The proliferation of the parental cell lines AR230,
LAMA84, and K562 were compared, respectively, with the nilotinibresistant lines AR230-rn, LAMA84-rn, and K562-rn, which were able
to grow in liquid culture until 20 nmol/L of nilotinib (Fig. 1A).
For instance, the IC50s for AR230-rn and K562-rn were 15 and
30 nmol/L, respectively, for nilotinib compared with 1 and
5 nmol/L, respectively, for their sensitive counterparts. We also
tested the effect of imatinib on nilotinib-resistant cell lines, showing that the sensitivity to imatinib was also modified in the
nilotinib-resistant cell lines (results not shown). However, LAMA84rn exhibits a pattern of proliferation different from the other cell
lines probably due to its mechanism of resistance whereas its
sensitive parental cell line LAMA84 is the most sensitive (Fig. 1A).
Some resistant cell lines overexpress Bcr-Abl. The level of
Bcr-Abl protein in the different nilotinib-sensitive and -resistant
cell lines was studied by immunoblotting. Albeit both AR230 and
LAMA84 cell lines did not express endogenous Abl, the nilotinibresistant cell lines showed a significant increase of Bcr-Abl
compared with the sensitive parental line as we have previously
described for imatinib, although it was less pronounced. With
regard to the human cell lines, the overall results show that

resistance to nilotinib may be mediated at least by up-regulated
expression of Bcr-Abl (Fig. 1B and C). The K562 nilotinib-resistant
cell line, K562-rn, expressed a similar level of Bcr-Abl compared
with its parental counterpart (no significant difference in the level
of Bcr-Abl was detected on four separate experiments) and this was
confirmed by flow cytometry detection of Abl (data not shown).
The 2-fold and 3-fold increased expression of Bcr-Abl detected,
respectively, in AR230-rn and LAMA84-rn were statistically significant on four separate experiments and was accompanied by an
increase in the phosphorylation status of STAT5 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). In addition, no mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase domain
was detected.
Nilotinib is a substrate of Pgp. Overexpression of Pgp (encoded
by the multidrug resistance gene; MDR-1) can functionally modify
the uptake of several drugs including imatinib as we have already
reported (15). We have tested the well-characterized K562/DOX cell
line that displays resistance to several drugs by overexpressing Pgp.
The resistance of K562/DOX to nilotinib was reversed by simultaneous incubation with either verapamil (IP50 = 0.5 mmol/L)
or PSC833 (IP50 = 0.1 mmol/L) confirming that nilotinib is a
substrate of the Pgp (Fig. 2A). We therefore studied the pattern
of Pgp expression by flow cytometry in the different nilotinib-

resistant cell lines and found that LAMA84-rn expressed the MDR-1
gene product, Pgp, indicating that at least two mechanisms
of resistance operate in this cell line, both a significant overexpression of Bcr-Abl and Pgp (Fig. 2B). Indeed, verapamil
incubation of LAMA-rn cells only partially restores the sensitivity
to nilotinib as this resistant cell line also overexpressed Bcr-Abl.
The two other nilotinib-resistant cell lines, AR230-rn and K562-rn,
were not positive for Pgp expression as tested by flow cytometry
(results not shown).
The K562 nilotinib-resistant cell line exhibits Lyn kinase
overexpression. In order to investigate whether resistance to
nilotinib is associated with tyrosine kinase expression, Western blot
analysis was performed using antiphosphotyrosine antibody.
Nilotinib-resistant cell lines, such as AR230-rn and LAMA84-rn,
harbored a phosphotyrosine pattern similar to their sensitive
counterpart. In contrast, in K562-rn cells, the pattern of protein
tyrosine phosphorylation shows different phosphorylated bands at
27, 40, 53, 56, 75, and 100 kDa (Fig. 3A).
Investigation of kinase identity shows an overexpression of
the tyrosine kinase Lyn (Fig. 3B) with a 10-fold increase (n = 6,
P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was detected for Hck.
According to the report of Dai and colleagues, Lyn overexpression

and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer, tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blotting using 4G10 antibody (A ). After stripping,
membranes were reprobed for the kinase Lyn, Hck, BclXL, Bcl-2, and actin as loading control (B). Arrows, proteins detected. Nilotinib-sensitive K562 (s ), imatinibresistant K562 (K562-i ), and nilotinib-resistant K562 (K562-rn ) cells grown for 5 d with (+) or without ( ) nilotinib were used for protein extraction and samples were
subjected to Western blotting against Lyn and actin (C ). Lyn was immunoprecipitated from these lysates and used for in vitro kinase assay. Results show the
autoradiography and the reprobe for Lyn (D ).

Lyn Kinase Up-regulated Expression in Nilotinib-Resistant CML

Figure 4. Sensitivity to nilotinib was restored by inhibition of Src kinase in nilotinib-resistant K562-rn. Proliferation of the nilotinib-sensitive K562 and the nilotinibresistant K562-rn cell lines were tested in the presence of increasing concentrations of nilotinib using the MTS assay. Inhibition of Src kinase by 2 Amol/L of PP1 (A )
or 2 Amol/L of PP2 (B ) partially restored sensitivity to nilotinib. Points, mean of the absorbance of the four-well set standardized in comparison with the starting
absorbance at day 0, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Calculated IC50
are 2 to 5 nmol/L for K562 or K562 plus either PP1 or PP2, 40 nmol/L for K562-rn and 20 nmol/L for K562-rn plus either PP1 or PP2.

was accompanied by an increase of Bcl-2 expression (16). This
overexpression was also detected at the mRNA level by quantitative
reverse-transcriptase PCR showing that the normalized Lyn
expression was 0.48 and 4.84 in K562 and K562-rn, respectively.
We detected the level of Lyn expression and activity after nilotinib
withdrawal for 5 days. Both Lyn expression and activity were
similar in K562-rn grown with or without nilotinib, although the
in vitro kinase activity of Lyn was higher in K562-rn in comparison
with the nilotinib-sensitive K562 (Fig. 4C and D). In an attempt to
prove that Lyn kinase is involved in the resistance to nilotinib in
K562-rn cells, two inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, were tested. K562 cells
were sensitive to nilotinib as previously shown but the proliferation
was not significantly affected by the presence of both Src kinase
inhibitors PP1 or PP2 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PP1 and PP2 (2 Amol/L)
dramatically modified the sensitivity of K562-rn cells (Fig. 4B). The
IC50 of nilotinib for K562 was 2 to 5 nmol/L and not modified after
either PP1or PP2 addition. For K562-rn and K562-rn plus PP1 or PP2
the IC50s were 40 nmol/L and decreased to 20 nmol/L, respectively.
The K562 nilotinib-resistant cell line overexpressing Lyn
kinase is sensitive to dasatinib. We also investigated the effect of
dasatinib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor with activity against
Bcr-Abl and the Src family kinases, on cell viability by proliferation
assay. Both K562 and K562-rn proliferation were inhibited by
dasatinib, suggesting that this inhibitor overrides the advantage of
Lyn overexpression (Fig. 5A). At the same time, we compared the
effects of 2 Amol/L of imatinib, 20 nmol/L of nilotinib, 10 Amol/L of
PP1, 10 Amol/L of PP2, and 200 nmol/L of dasatinib in both K562
and K562-rn cells on whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation using
Western blotting. Following incubation for 3 hours, dasatinib
strongly decreased the whole pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation
in both cell lines, especially the bands at 210, 140, 55, and 39 kDa
(Fig. 5B). Imatinib and nilotinib in the same conditions were

www.aacrjournals.org

able to decrease Bcr-Abl and Abl phosphorylation in K562 cells
but weakly so in K562-rn, suggesting the participation of other
kinases in Bcr-Abl phosphorylation. These inhibitors did not
change the phosphorylation of Lyn. The incubation of K562-rn cells
with Src kinase inhibitors PP1 or PP2 weakly decreased the whole
phosphorylation pattern, although Lyn phosphorylation was not
decreased, suggesting that Lyn overexpression masks the inhibitory
effect of PP1 or PP2 (Fig. 5). However, a decrease of Lyn and STAT5
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen with higher concentrations of
PP1 or PP2 (40 Amol/L; data not shown; Supplementary Fig. S2B
and C). As suspected, the two inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, did not significantly modify the proliferation of LAMA-rn or AR230-rn cell lines.
Silencing Lyn restored the sensitivity to nilotinib. Cell lines
(K562 and K562-rn) were transfected by control or targeted siRNA
and grown for 24 hours in RF-10. After this period, each sample
was divided into two parts and grown in the absence or in the
presence of 20 nmol/L of nilotinib. In parallel, a proliferation assay
was set up on both transfected cell lines either with control siRNA
or anti-Lyn siRNA. From day 2, Lyn expression was measured by
Western blot each day until day 4. The siRNA anti-Lyn induced a
large decrease of Lyn expression in the K562 cell line, whereas the
control siRNA did not modify the expression. The proliferation of
both the control and anti-Lyn siRNA-transfected K562 cells was
inhibited by nilotinib (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the sensitivity to
nilotinib was not modified by the control siRNA in K562-rn cells,
whereas the anti-Lyn siRNA dramatically decreases the expression
of Lyn (60%) which restored the sensitivity to nilotinib. These
results confirm the critical role of Lyn in the nilotinib-resistant
K562-rn cell line.

PP2, and 200 nmol/L of dasatinib. After

patients before and after resistance to nilotinib (Supplementary
Table S1). For two patients (nos. 4 and 7), a significant increase
of Lyn expression was observed after resistance acquisition. For
two patients (nos. 1 and 3), a slight increase was found. In three
other patients (nos. 2, 5, and 6), no significant variation was
observed. Of note, two out of three patients displayed mutations in
the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. Bcr-Abl mRNA was increased under
nilotinib treatment, illustrating the progression of the disease of
these patients.

Discussion
In the work reported here, we used Bcr-Abl–positive cell lines
to generate sublines with differential sensitivity to nilotinib and
investigated the mechanisms of resistance. Using a strategy similar
to the one used previously to characterize imatinib-resistant cells,
we compared the different clones and studied the mechanisms
involved. Regarding MDR-1 gene expression, this mechanism has
already been reported in imatinib-resistant cell lines (15, 17, 18).
Similar behaviors in the development of resistance to other
chemotherapeutic agents have been described (19, 20). The most
extensively studied mediator of this phenomenon is the Pgp
protein encoded by the MDR-1 gene, which affects the uptake of a
soluble compound by ‘‘pumping out’’ the drugs through the plasma
membrane. Measurement of Pgp expression in the three nilotinib-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

resistant cell lines showed that one of them, LAMA84-rn, did
indeed overexpress Pgp, in comparison to the LAMA84 nilotinibsensitive line. The inhibition of Pgp with verapamil or PSC833,
potent blockers of the pump, led to an improved uptake of nilotinib
in LAMA84-rn and resulted in a weak reduction of its IC50 (21).
It is important to note that inhibition of Pgp resulted in the
enhancement of the sensitivity of LAMA84-rn to higher doses of
nilotinib, but was not sufficient to fully overcome their resistance
to the concentration in which they normally survive. This is most
likely due to the fact that this cell line carries a second, independent mechanism of resistance, i.e., Bcr-Abl overexpression,
which on its own, is able to sustain the basic resistant phenotype as
has previously been described (15, 22). We recently reported that
polymorphisms of the MDR-1 gene are involved in the response to
imatinib in patients with CML, and it will be worthwhile to study
its involvement in nilotinib response, although a similar role is
clearly suspected (23).
Both AR230-rn and LAMA84-rn cell lines showed up-regulated
expression of Bcr-Abl (2-fold and 3-fold, respectively) and such BcrAbl overexpression could be bypassed by the additional use of Src
inhibitors such as CGP76030 (22). Up-regulated expression of BcrAbl was accompanied by an increase of the phosphorylated form of
STAT5 in nilotinib-resistant cells. In addition to the higher level of
Bcr-Abl detected in LAM84-rn than in the AR230-rn cell line, the
expression of the MDR-1 gene in LAM84-rn emphasized the results

Lyn Kinase Up-regulated Expression in Nilotinib-Resistant CML

of the proliferation assay. Indeed, our results suggest that as more
Bcr-Abl is expressed, more inhibitor is required. In addition to the
already known mechanisms of resistance, the most interesting one
was the up-regulated expression of the Lyn tyrosine kinase. An
overexpression of two Src kinases, Lyn and Hck, was reported by
Donato and colleagues in the same cell line resistant to imatinib
and in CML blast-crisis patients (24). However, the peculiar K562
cell line resistant to imatinib in their study underexpressed Bcr-Abl,
as shown both by the decrease of Bcr-Abl expression and signaling.
In this study, the nilotinib-resistant K562 cell line expresses a
similar level of Bcr-Abl, suggesting that a down-regulation of
Bcr-Abl is not a direct consequence of Lyn overexpression. The
overexpression of Lyn detected in the K562-rn cell line was
quantified as a 10-fold increase. It will be interesting to elucidate
the mechanism of overexpression and the triggered modification of
signaling pathways. The role of Lyn in the resistance to nilotinib
was emphasized by the effect of PP1 or PP2, two compounds well
characterized for Src kinase inhibition, although the former also
inhibits Bcr-Abl (25). Moreover, treatment of the K562-rn cell line
with SU6656, a Src kinase inhibitor, decreased both the whole cell
tyrosine phosphorylation and viability (data not shown). A partial
restoration of nilotinib sensitivity was detected in proliferation
assays of K562-rn incubated with PP1 or PP2. Although Src kinase
inhibitors PP1 or PP2 weakly decreased the whole phosphorylation
pattern, Lyn phosphorylation was not decreased, suggesting that
Lyn overexpression masks the inhibitory effect of PP1 or PP2

(Fig. 5). However, a decrease of Lyn and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation was seen with higher concentrations of PP1 or PP2
(40 Amol/L; data not shown; Supplementary Fig. S2B and C).
Although dasatinib inhibits STAT5 in both K562 and K562-rn cells,
high concentrations of nilotinib had no effect (results shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2D). Another study, reported by Dai and
colleagues, described two Bcr-Abl–independent imatinib-resistant
cell lines (K562 and LAMA) in which Lyn overexpression was
associated with Bcl-2 expression, an antiapoptotic protein involved
in imatinib resistance (16). In the nilotinib-resistant K562-rn cells,
the 10-fold increase in Lyn expression was associated with an
increase of Bcl-2 expression, whereas no significant modification
of BclXL was detected. It is well known that Lyn kinase is involved
in cytokine signaling pathways in many hematopoietic cell types
and such overexpression may be able to bypass the inhibitory effect
of nilotinib on Bcr-Abl (26, 27). A possible role of Lyn may be to
increase the oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl by the phosphorylation of specific domains, as it was reported for the SH3-SH2
domains or the Y177 site for the recruitment of adaptors (28, 29).
It is noticeable that the whole tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl
is similar in both cell lines although K562-rn overexpressed the
kinase Lyn. However, the detection of specific phosphorylation site(s)
may help to discern whether some are more phosphorylated in
K562-rn cells. Targeting Lyn in K562-rn did not change the total BCRABL phosphorylation. However, dasatinib, the dual Src and BcrAbl inhibitor strongly reduces the whole tyrosine phosphorylation

pattern of K562-rn cells and triggers apoptosis. This result strongly
suggests that dasatinib targets are involved in the resistance
to nilotinib in K562-rn cells. In light of the recent report concerning
the chemical proteomic profiles of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, dasatinib is
able to interact with at least 32 kinases (30). Among these, the
tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec were inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib (31). However, a similar level of Btk was
detected in both cell lines. The critical role of Lyn in nilotinib
resistance is shown by silencing Lyn expression in K562-rn cells that
is accompanied by a complete restoration of nilotinib sensitivity.
However, it will be worthwhile to investigate the potential involvement of a Btk pathway downstream of Lyn, as it is already known in
B cell signaling.
Overall, the results presented in this study show that, among the
mechanisms of resistance to nilotinib, most are similar to those
reported for imatinib such as Bcr-Abl overexpression, MDR-1
expression, or Src kinase up-regulated expression. However, we
cannot exclude the participation of another tyrosine kinase in the
mechanism of nilotinib resistance in the peculiar K562-rn cell line,
in which a critical role of Lyn was shown. Moreover, this is the first
