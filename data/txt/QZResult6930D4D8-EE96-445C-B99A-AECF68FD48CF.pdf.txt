Abstract
The proapoptotic cytokine tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is being evaluated presently as a selective anticancer agent, but its limited effects
against cancer cell lines has raised some concerns about its
ultimate clinical utility. Here, we review recent findings that
cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL is greatly increased when the
Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 is down-regulated by the Raf/
vascular endothelial growth factor kinase inhibitor sorafenib, a Food and Drug Administration–approved cancer
drug. Using the TRAIL-sorafenib combination as a tactic to
more effectively kill cancer cells may provide an effective
tool to attack a variety of human cancers that are largely presently untreatable. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2062–4]

Introduction
Development of cancer-specific therapy with little or no toxic side
effects is one of the goals of molecular oncology and translational
research. Targeting specific oncogenes encoding kinases or receptors using small-molecule inhibitors or recombinant antibodies has
proven to be an excellent treatment paradigm for cancer patients
(e.g., imatinib mesylate/Gleevec; trastuzumab/Herceptin). Targeted
therapies have favorable side effects but are effective only in minor
populations of patients with tumors harboring their specific
oncogene targets (1). But tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) is different in its potential to target a broad
host of tumors, which it normally does as part of the host immune
system. Since its discovery, TRAIL has attracted great interest as a
cancer cell–specific cytotoxic agent with virtually no off-target
effects (2). TRAIL or antibodies that target the receptors of TRAIL are
currently in clinical trials. However, many human tumor cell lines are
resistant to TRAIL therapy, suggesting the potential that many
patients will be nonresponders. Therefore, considerable effort is
being directed at the identification of mechanisms to increase
sensitivity to the tumor killing effects of TRAIL and to sensitize
TRAIL-resistant cancers.

Determinants of the Resistance of a Cancer Cell to
TRAIL Therapy
TRAIL is a type II transmembrane protein, and its extracellular

surface as a 19-kDa circulating molecule that binds one of two
agonistic receptors, DR4 and DR5. TRAIL binding to DR4 or DR5
activates the apoptotic machinery of the target cell (3). After
activating its death receptors, there are many potential defects in
the apoptotic pathway that can block cell death triggered by
TRAIL. Cells may have too little death receptor expression or may
have high TRAIL decoy receptor expression to gain protection from
the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL (4). Cells may lose apical caspase
expression (5) or may harbor high expression of the initiator
caspase activation inhibitor c-FLIP leading to TRAIL resistance (6).
Cancer cells may inhibit intrinsic mitochondrial pathways leading
to cell death by increasing antiapoptotic or decreasing proapoptotic molecules, including those of the Bcl-2 family (7). Such
tumors are likely to resist TRAIL-mediated apoptosis if they require
amplification of the death signal through the mitochondria. With
such heterogeneity and multiple mechanisms that tumors use to
evade TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, is it possible to identify a useful
strategy to sensitize a wide-range of TRAIL-resistant cancers?
Three recent papers revealing previously unknown relationships
between TRAIL, Mcl-1, and sorafenib suggest that it may indeed be
possible to use a single sensitizing agent when the apoptotic defect
is harbored in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

TRAIL Resistance Conferred by Mcl-1 and Its
Reversal by c-Myc
Our investigation into the relationship between TRAIL and Mcl-1
began with c-Myc (8). c-Myc is not only a potent cellular oncogene
but also a potent apoptosis inducer. Previously, we identified that
c-Myc expression is a major determinant of TRAIL sensitivity and
can also sensitize cells to TRAIL (6). As an extension of this earlier
study, we recently examined whether c-Myc overexpression in
TRAIL-resistant Bax-deficient HCT116 human colon cancer cells
could sensitize these cells through c-Myc. We hypothesized that
c-Myc might sensitize Bax-deficient cells to TRAIL through effects
on c-FLIP or possibly through effects on mitochondria that amplify
signaling through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Myc did seem to
be a potent sensitizer of the Bax-deficient human colon tumor cells
to TRAIL, but we found that the underlying mechanism involved the
intrinsic rather than extrinsic pathway (8). We also found that
antiapoptotic molecules Mcl-1 and cIAP-2 were induced by TRAIL
treatment in TRAIL-resistant Bax-null and other TRAIL-resistant
cells in a nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–dependent manner (8). The
induction of the antiapoptotic NF-nB targets was significantly
diminished by c-Myc expression, and this correlated with TRAIL
sensitization. We confirmed that Mcl-1 plays the predominant role
for this mitochondrial form of TRAIL resistance.

Mechanism and Reversal of TRAIL Resistance by
the Multikinase Inhibitor Sorafenib
Our observations initially led us to investigate the ability of
TRAIL to activate Raf signaling because Mcl-1 (and cIAP-2) were

both identified to be cAMP-responsive element binding protein
(CREB) targets, and CREB signaling is downstream of Raf. This
led us to discover that the Raf/vascular endothelial growth factor
kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, could inhibit Mcl-1 transcriptional
induction by TRAIL, and that Mcl-1 induction was mediated by
NF-nB. TRAIL-induced NF-nB–mediated transcriptional activation
of Mcl-1, and NF-nB binding to the Mcl-1 promoter could be
blocked by sorafenib. Sorafenib, however, did not alter the
nuclear localization of NF-nB after TRAIL treatment, but it did
decrease the DNA-binding ability of NF-nB. Therefore, sorafenib
seems to inhibit the DNA-binding capacity of NF-nB after
translocation into nucleus through unclear mechanisms. One
possible mechanism for sorafenib action on the DNA-binding
function of NF-nB is potentially through changes in the
phosphorylation status of NF-nB subunits in the nucleus.
Alternatively, a recent report showed that oncogenic BRAF
increased h-Trcp, which functions as the substrate recognition
subunit of the E3 ligase for InB and potentiates NF-nB activity.
Sorafenib can mediate decreased InB kinase activity through this
pathway (9). There is also the possibility that sorafenib directly
regulates other transcription factors involved in Mcl-1 regulation
(Fig. 1). Furthermore, recent reports have shown that sorafenib
can down-regulate Mcl-1 through translational or posttranslational mechanisms (10).

Sorafenib Sensitizes TRAIL-Resistant Leukemia
Cells through Mcl-1 Down-regulation
Two additional studies recently found that Mcl-1 plays a
significant role in mediating TRAIL-resistance and that sorafenib
can be used to inhibit Mcl-1 action. Meng et al. (11) reported that
Mcl-1 confers TRAIL resistance by serving as a buffer for Bak,
Bim, and Puma but not tBid and showed that down-regulation of
Mcl-1 by sorafenib sensitizes resistant cells to TRAIL-induced
death in TRAIL-resistant leukemia cell lines and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient specimens. Although they did not
examine Mcl-1 levels after TRAIL treatment, Meng et al. (11) did
observe an increase in Bak activation with the combination of
TRAIL plus sorafenib. Rosato et al. (12) examined human
malignant hematopoeitic cells and showed down-regulation of
Mcl-1 by sorafenib sensitized cell lines and AML patient samples
to TRAIL. They found that sorafenib down-regulated Mcl-1 and
also Bcl-xL, and that Mcl-1 preferentially inhibits Bak activation
when compared with Bax.
Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that can bind to
BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, Bid, Puma, and Bak, thereby, when
at sufficiently high levels, functions as a reservoir for those
proapoptotic proteins (13). Regulation of Mcl-1 protein level can be
a critical barrier for preventing unwanted cell death. Conversely,
overexpression of Mcl-1 can desensitize cells to a cell death signal,

Figure 1. Pathways mediating sensitization to TRAIL by down-regulation of Mcl-1. In TRAIL-resistant cells, TRAIL induces NF-nB activity and Mcl-1 transcription
to block BH-3 only protein function. Treatment using sorafenib blocks NF-nB activity by transcriptional inhibition of Mcl-1. Sorafenib also inhibits translational expression
of Mcl-1. Released BH-3–only proteins shift TRAIL-resistant cells toward sensitivity and apoptotic death.

especially in the context of preventing the death of an unwanted
(i.e., transformed) cell (14). The importance of Mcl-1 in mediating
TRAIL-resistance was shown previously by studies showing that
down-regulation of Mcl-1 by siRNA enhanced TRAIL-mediated
cell death (15, 16), and a microRNA, mir-29b, was reported to
endogenously regulate Mcl-1 expression, and its enforced expression made cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL (17). However, a practical
method to down-regulate Mcl-1 expression in cancer cells was not
described until the recent reports (8, 11, 12).

Derivation of a Rationale for a Potentially Effective
Therapy in the Clinic
Sorafenib, which was suggested as a potent TRAIL sensitizer in
the three recent papers described here (8, 11, 12), is approved for
use in treatment of renal cancers and is currently undergoing
investigation in >30 clinical trials against a wide range of human
cancers. Sorafenib has been shown to affect survival in hepatocellular carcinoma and was approved as therapy for this disease by

the Food and Drug Administration in late 2007. It is therefore
possible that the TRAIL plus sorafenib combination therapy may
be effective at least for treatment of some TRAIL-resistant cancers.
In the rare instances where the resistance to TRAIL relies on
defects in the extrinsic pathway, such as absence of death receptor
expression or down-regulation of caspase 8, the TRAIL plus
sorafenib combination is unlikely to be helpful. Down-regulation of
FLIP (6) or death receptor O-glycosylation have emerged as
mechanisms of TRAIL sensitization (18), and if effective ways to
modulate these molecules are found, then overcoming extrinsic
pathway defects might be possible to some extent. For a wide-range
of human cancers possessing intrinsic pathway defects that confer
TRAIL resistance, sorafenib now seems to be a promising
sensitizing agent for use in combination with TRAIL or proapoptotic TRAIL receptor agonists.
