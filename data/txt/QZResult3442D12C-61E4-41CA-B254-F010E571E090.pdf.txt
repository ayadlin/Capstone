BACKGROUND. The objective of the current study was to determine the histologic
and molecular changes that occurred in patients with high-risk, localized prostate
cancer (PCa) after neoadjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy.
METHODS. Patients who had locally advanced PCa (serum preoperative [initial]
prostate-specific antigen [iPSA] level 15 ng/mL, or clinical T2b disease, or
biopsy Gleason score [GS] 8) and no evidence of metastatic disease received
6 doses of intravenous docetaxel (40 mg/m2) administered weekly for 6 weeks
followed by radical prostatectomy (RP). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used
to compare pretreatment and posttreatment markers.
RESULTS. Twenty-eight patients completed chemotherapy and underwent RP at the
Cleveland Clinic; none achieved a pathologic complete response. Pretreatment diagnostic prostate biopsies (PBx) were reviewed in all patients, and unstained sections of
formalin-fixed tissue were available from 11 patients. The median patient age was 62
years (range, 49–72 years), and the median iPSA was 6.8 ng/mL (range, 2.5–24 ng/
mL). At a median follow-up of 49.5 months (range, 23–72 months), 12 patients (43%)
remained clinically and biochemically free of disease with no additional therapy, and
16 patients (57%) had biochemical failure. The pretreatment GS was 6 in 2 patients
(7%), 7 in 10 patients (36%), 8 in 11 patients (39%) and 9 in 5 patients (18%). Two
patients (7.1%) had organ-confined disease, and 23 patients (82.1%) had extraprostatic extension. Four patients (14.3%) had positive lymph nodes, and 11 patients
(39.3%) had seminal vesicle involvement. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for a
panel of markers involved in various cellular functions (a-methylacyl-coenzyme A
racemase [AMACR], b-tubulin I, b-tubulin III, cyclin D1, p27, p21, Ki-67, p53, Bcl-2,
and an apoptosis detection kit [ApopTag]) was performed on a tissue microarray that
contained the posttreatment (RP) tissue specimens and on the PBx specimens, if available. When the IHC staining patterns were compared between PBx and RP specimens
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, only p53 expression (P 5 .017) and Bcl-2 expression (P 5 .014) were found to be increased significantly after neoadjuvant docetaxel
treatment. However, after performing the Bonferroni adjustment, these differences
were no longer significant (P > .005). Ki-67, ApopTag, b-tubulin I, and b-tubulin III
expression levels also were increased after treatment; however, the differences were
not found to be statistically significant. The expression levels of AMACR, p27, p21, and
cyclin D1 were comparable in pretreatment and posttreatment specimens.
CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that, although it will require longer follow-up studies and larger numbers of patients to ascertain the value of neoadjuvant
treatment, the negative findings of the current study may explain the lack of clinical
response in patients who received neoadjuvant docetaxel for PCa. Although the
results were subject to interpretation limits based on the study size, the increased
expression of p53 and Bcl-2 that was detected after treatment using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test suggested that the apoptotic pathway may be an important target
for this drug, and further investigation is warranted. Cancer 2007;110:1248–54.

Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in PCa/Magi-Galluzzi et al.

P

rostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed nonskin malignancy and the third leading
cause of cancer death in men.1 Patients who have
locally advanced PCa have worse outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) compared with patients who
have more favorable parameters. Although chemotherapy historically has had limited utility in treating
PCa, the results from 2 recent randomized clinical
trials indicated that docetaxel-based chemotherapy
improves survival in patients with hormone-refractory PCa.2,3 Given the demonstrated utility of docetaxel-based therapy in advanced disease, there has
been considerable interest in exploring the utility of
these agents in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant
settings in an attempt to improve systemic control of
high-risk disease.
Docetaxel is a taxoid derived from the European
yew tree, Taxus baccata. Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) achieve their antineoplastic activity by the
stabilization of the microtubules with arrest in cell
proliferation in the G2-M phase and by inducing
Bcl-2 phosphorylation and inactivating antiapoptotic
mechanisms.4 Drugs that affect the integrity of
microtubules are able to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation, abrogating the normal antiapoptotic function
of Bcl-2 and initiating the apoptotic program in the
cycling cancer cells. In this report, we describe the
histologic and molecular characteristics of patients
with locally advanced PCa who received neoadjuvant
docetaxel.5

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Specimens
Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study
between May 2001 and April 2003. Eligibility criteria
included histologically documented, locally advanced
PCa, which was defined by a serum preoperative (initial) prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) level 15 ng/mL;
clinical tumor (T) classification T2b, T2c, or T3 (any
PSA level or grade); or biopsy Gleason score (GS) 8
(any stage or PSA level); and no evidence of metastatic disease. The Cleveland Clinic Institutional
Review Board reviewed and approved the trial in accordance with an assurance filed with and approved
by the Department of Health and Human Services.
All patients provided written informed consent
before registration.
Treatment consisted of intravenous docetaxel at
a dose of 40 mg/m2 administered weekly for 6 weeks.
Within 3 weeks of completing chemotherapy, 28 of
29 patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and retropubic RP according to a standardized
technique under epidural anesthesia. After RP,

1249

patients were followed postoperatively by their urologists in a routine manner with serum PSA assessments every 3 to 6 months. Biochemical disease recurrence was defined as serum PSA levels 0.3 ng/dL
on 2 occasions confirmed at least 1 week apart.5
The prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy specimens were fixed in formalin for 24 hours. The prostatectomy specimen was inked in 2 colors, stepsectioned at 3-mm intervals, and evaluated as quartermounts. The histologic analysis included evidence
of residual cancer, necrosis, extraprostatic extension
(EPE), seminal vesicle (SV) involvement, surgical
margins, and lymph node status.
The pathologic response to the neoadjuvant treatment was assessed by a single pathologist (C.M.-G.). A
pathologic complete response was defined as complete
eradication of tumor.

Construction of Tissue Microarray and Collection
of Pretreatment Specimens
A prostate tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed
that contained samples from the 28 RP specimens,
including PCa samples and corresponding nonneoplastic prostatic tissues as controls for each patient.
Three different paraffin blocks from each patient
were used to construct the TMA to ensure sampling
from different PCa areas. Briefly, areas of interest
(PCa and nonneoplastic tissue) were traced with a
marker pen on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides.
The least differentiated regions of each individual
paraffin-embedded prostate tumor were chosen. The
corresponding areas were then marked on the corresponding paraffin blocks (donor blocks) and were
arrayed precisely onto a new recipient paraffin block
(35 3 20 mm) with a manual TMA arrayer (Beecher
Instruments, Sun Praire, Wis). Three 1-mm-thick tissue cores from PCa and 3 nonneoplastic tissue cores
were taken for each specimen. After the block construction was completed, 5-lm sections were cut
with a microtome using an adhesive-coated tape-sectioning system (Instrumedics, Hackensack, NJ) and
were mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides and
stored for future use. Hematoxylin and eosin staining
was performed on the initial TMA slide to verify the
histologic diagnosis for each core. The number of
samples varied slightly between the individual
marker analyses because of variability in the number
of interpretable specimens on TMA sections.
Pretreatment diagnostic prostate biopsies (PBx)
that were performed at other institutions were
reviewed, and representative, unstained sections or
corresponding paraffin blocks were requested after
the patient’s consent was obtained. Unstained PBx

sections were available for only 11 of 28 patients
(39%).

Immunohistochemistry
TMA and unstained PBx sections were used for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to analyze the expression of a panel of molecules involved in various
cellular functions, such as proliferation (Ki-67),
microtubule formation (b-tubulin I and b-tubulin
III), apoptosis (Bcl-2, p53, p21, and an apoptosis
detection kit [ApopTag]), cell cycle progression
(cyclin D1, p27), and a potential early PCa marker,
a-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR). A
standard, indirect immunoperoxidase procedure (ABCElite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) was
used for detection of the secondary antibodies. The
primary antibodies, their dilutions, and the pretreatment conditions are listed in Table 1. Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen in most of analyses
except for b-tubulin III, for which alkaline phosphatase was used as the chromogen. The primary antibody was omitted for negative controls. All slides
were read by a single pathologist (C.M.-G.). Quantification of the Ki-67 labeling index, p21, p27, Bcl-2,
ApopTag, and p53 was performed by manually
counting 1000 cells (for PBx sections) or the cells in
all 3 cores that contained tumor (for TMA samples)
and is expressed as the percentage of positive cells.
For Ki-67 and p53 analyses, only nuclear staining
was considered. The intensity of staining for AMACR,
b-tubulin I, b-tubulin III, and cyclin D1 was scored
visually and stratified into 4 groups: negative (2),
weak (1), moderate (11), and strong (111). For a
marker to be considered positive, 5% of the tumor
cells had to show some degree of staining (1, 11, or
111). AMACR expression was also converted to a
yes/no variable.

Statistical Analysis
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to study the
correlation between the expression of different markers in the pretreatment and posttreatment specimens because of nonparametric and paired values. A
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was
used, with P values <.005 considered significant. The
Cox and Kaplan-Meier models were used to determine any possible association between continuous
or nominal markers, respectively, and biochemical
failure.
The patients who received treatment with neoadjuvant docetaxel also were matched on biopsy GS
and preoperative PSA (iPSA) levels 1:1 with untreated
patients, and the results were analyzed by using chisquare or Fisher exact texts, as appropriate; Cox proportional-hazards regression; and the Kaplan-Meier
method. The level of statistical significance was
P < .05, and all P values were 2-sided. Statistical calculations were performed using the StatView software package (version 5.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Twenty-eight patients completed chemotherapy and
underwent RP at the Cleveland Clinic. Pretreatment
PBx specimens were reviewed in all patients, and
unstained sections of formalin-fixed tissue were
available in 11 patients. The median patient age was
62 years (range, 49–72 years), and the median preoperative iPSA level was 6.8 ng/mL (range, 2.5–24 ng/
mL). At a median follow-up of 49.5 months (range,
23–72 months), 12 patients (43%) remained clinically
and biochemically disease free with no additional
therapy, and 16 patients (57%) had biochemical failure. The pretreatment GS was 6 in 2 patients (7%), 7
in 10 patients (36%), 8 in 11 patients (39%), and 9 in
5 patients (18%). Two patients (7.1%) had organ-confined disease, and 23 patients (82.1%) had EPE. Four
patients (14.3%) had positive lymph nodes, and 11
patients (39.3%) had seminal vesicles involvement.
Pathologic analyses of the RP specimens demonstrated residual PCa in all patients. Compared with
preoperative PBx specimens, most benign prostatic
glands showed prominent basal cells and urothelial
metaplasia after docetaxel treatment. Corpora amylacea with dense central core were present in all
patients. The prostate glands from patients with PCa
showed some changes that were attributable to treatment (‘‘treatment effect’’). Some degree of cytoplasmic vacuolization and/or clear cell changes was
detected in all tumors (Fig. 1). Needle-like, crystalloid
structures were noted in the lumen of neoplastic

(Table 2).
Different degrees of AMACR expression (weak, 1;
moderate, 11; or strong, 111) was detected in 89%
and 82% of the RP and PBx specimens, respectively,
with a strong staining pattern (111) in 46% and
55% of the positive specimens, respectively. Expression of p27 was detected in 96% of RP specimens
and 91% of PBx specimens, expression of p21 was
detected in 59% of RP specimens and 18% of PBx
specimens, and expression of cyclin D1 was detected
in 92% of RP specimens and 73% of PBx specimens.
Expression levels of AMACR (median, 11 vs 11;
P 5 .530), p27 (median, 60% vs 60%; P 5 .770), p21
(median, 0% vs 0%; P 5 .130), and cyclin D1 (median, 11 vs 11; P 5 .070) were comparable in pretreatment and posttreatment specimens (Table 2).
The posttreatment expression levels of the markers
that were evaluated in this study were not significantly predictive of biochemical recurrence (Table 3).
The 28 patients who received treatment with
neoadjuvant docetaxel (cases) were matched on biopsy GS and preoperative iPSA level 1:1 with
untreated patients (controls) from the same institution. The control group was chosen by using random

number generator tables and spanned the same
years as the case group. The GS and iPSA were
pooled and matched (GS: 2–6, 7, and 8–10; iPSA: 0–4
ng/mL, 4–10 ng/mL, 10–20 ng/mL, and >20 ng/mL).
The results were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
analysis (Fig. 4), and chi-square tests, and Fisher
exact tests (Table 4). Patients in the control group
had a minimum of 24 months of PSA follow-up. The
PSA follow-up for patients in the case group ranged
from 23 months to 72 months (median, 48.5
months). The time to biochemical failure for cases
and controls ranged from 0 months to 71 months
(median, 36.5 months). The controls had lower clinical T classification (Fisher exact test; P < .001) and
less EPE (chi-square test; P 5 .002). The difference in
biochemical outcome of the 2 groups was not statistically significant (log-rank test; P 5 .390) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
It has been demonstrated that a class of taxanes has
significant antitumor activity in men with hormone-refractory PCa when administered either as single agents
or in combination with estramustine. The results from
2 randomized studies, Southwest Oncology Group 9916
and TAX 327 (an industry-sponsored, phase III trial),
which compared docetaxel-based chemotherapy with
mitoxantrone-based therapy, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage for a docetaxelbased treatment in patients with castrated, metastatic
PCa.2,3,6 Given the modest but clinically relevant activity of docetaxel-based therapy in advanced disease,
exploration of early administration of systemic therapy
is of clinical interest. The increasing capability to predict which patients are likely to have recurrent disease
after treatment with RP has led to a growing interest in

both neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies for patients
who have a high risk of systemic failure.7
Androgen deprivation therapy administered concomitantly with external beam radiotherapy for
selected patients with high-risk disease has demonstrated an improvement in both disease-specific and
overall survival.8 In contrast, to date, neoadjuvant
hormone therapy prior to RP has not demonstrated
any improvement in either the time to clinical progression or survival.9
Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy for men
with high-risk localized PCa has been tested in several
small clinical trials.5,10–16 For patients who received
single-agent docetaxel, a substantial PSA decline
(>50%) was observed in 50% to 100% of patients, but
no pathologic complete response was reported.5,11,15
Similar to the study by Febbo et al., we detected
no pathologically complete responses in patients with
high-risk, localized PCa who received docetaxel prior
to undergoing RP.11 However, there are some histolo-

1253

gic changes that are present more commonly in RP
specimens than in PBx specimens, including basal
cell hyperplasia and urothelial metaplasia in benign
glands and clear cell changes and vacuolation in cancer cells. Some of the morphologic changes occurring
in PCa glands that are attributable to ‘‘treatment
effect’’ may be explained by the inhibition of microtubule disassembly by taxanes. The polymerization of
the tubules may be responsible for the cytoplasmic
vacuolization and for the needle-like, crystalloid structures noted in the lumen of neoplastic glands.
The mechanisms of cytotoxicity of taxanes/taxoids in PCa undoubtedly are complex. Taxanes are
potent inhibitors of microtubule disassembly by
promoting polymerization of the tubules and appear
to initiate the apoptotic process by binding to btubulin and promoting its polymerization.17 Consequently, cells are arrested in the G2/M phase of the
cell cycle, after which, they either may undergo cell
death by apoptosis or necrosis or they may overcome the G2/M stop and continue in the division
cycle. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 and/or the upregulation of p53 certainly are among the important
modes proposed for the induction of apoptosis by
taxanes.4
To elucidate the mechanism of action of docetaxel and the tissue effect on PCa, we evaluated the
expression of surrogate biomarkers involved in microtubule polymerization and in the proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic pathways. In our study, we observed the
up-regulation of Bcl-2 (P 5 .014) and p53 (P 5 .017)
after treatment by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. However, when we used a Bonferroni adjustment,
these differences were no longer significant (P > .005).
The expression levels of b-tubulin I, b-tubulin III, and
ApopTag also were increased slightly in posttreatment
specimens compared with the corresponding pretreatment specimens, although the difference was not statistically significant.
The up-regulation of p53 and the increased
expression of ApopTag detected in the posttreatment
specimens support the mechanism proposed for apoptosis induction by taxanes. The increased expression of b-tubulin I and b-tubulin III in the same set
of specimens is in keeping with the results from preclinical studies suggesting that docetaxel has a somewhat greater affinity for tubulin than paclitaxel.17
The discordant finding of posttreatment up-regulation of p53 in association with the up-regulation of
Bcl-2 and increased expression of Ki-67 in the same
set of patients may be explained by the clonal heterogeneity of PCa cells and by the existence of different
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways identified in
PCa cell lines and tissues. The possibility that the

1254

CANCER

findings described above were the result of chance
and small sample size also should be considered.
None of the markers expressed in posttreatment
PCa samples were significantly predictive of biochemical recurrence. When patients who were treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel (cases) were matched
on biopsy GS and preoperative PSA 1:1 with
untreated patients (controls) and the results were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportionalhazards analyses, the difference in biochemical outcome for the 2 groups was not statistically significant
(log-rank P 5 .390).
Febbo et al. used oligonucleotide microarrays to
measure the gene expression in tumors from patients
who had received neoadjuvant docetaxel for 6 months
and compared it with the gene expression in
untreated prostate tumors. Although there were 332
genes with small but significant differences in expression between the 2 groups, there were no genes with
large (>5-fold) changes in expression between treated
and untreated prostate tumors. A set of genes
involved in androgen and estrogen metabolism was
identified that was up-regulated in the treated samples. Those authors suggested that the genes identified may account in part for the decline in PSA levels
after neoadjuvant docetaxel administration and may
be a potential mechanism for chemotherapy resistance.11 The results of both gene expression and IHC
analyses suggest that the tissue effect of docetaxel is
quite inadequate and certainly argues against using
this agent as neoadjuvant monotherapy.
Given the marked clonal heterogeneity of PCa,
multimodality approaches directed against multiple
molecular targets, rather than single-agent therapy,
may be necessary to eradicate adequately the entire
malignant cell population. New molecularly targeted
agents may interact favorably with taxanes and
enhance the apoptotic response or circumvent cellular adaptations that confer drug resistance. An accurate examination of the molecular pathways involved
in tumor progression and resistance to treatment
and further elucidation of signaling pathways that
regulate microtubule dynamics and programmed cell
death after exposure to microtubule inhibitors will
play a key role in the development of future taxanebased therapies for PCa.
