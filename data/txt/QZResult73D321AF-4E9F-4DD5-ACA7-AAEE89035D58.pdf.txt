Abstract
Identification of molecular markers often leads to important
clinical applications such as early diagnosis, prognosis, and
drug targeting. Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths, still lacks reliable molecular markers. We
have combined the bioinformatics analysis of the public gene
expression data and clinical validation to identify biomarker
genes for non–small-cell lung cancer. The serial analysis of
gene expression and the expressed sequence tag data were
meta-analyzed to produce a list of the differentially expressed
genes in lung cancer. Through careful inspection of the predicted genes, we selected 20 genes for experimental validation
using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. The microdissected clinical specimens used in the study consisted of
three groups: lung tissues from benign diseases and the paired
(cancer and pathologic normal) tissues from non–small-cell
lung cancer patients. After extensive statistical analyses, seven
genes (CBLC, CYP24A1, ALDH3A1, AKR1B10, S100P, PLUNC, and
LOC147166) were identified as potential diagnostic markers.
Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to additionally
assess the value of the seven identified genes leading to the
confirmation of at least two genes (CBLC and CYP24A1) as
highly probable novel biomarkers. The gene properties of
the identified markers, especially their relationship to lung
cancer and cell signaling pathway regulation, further suggest
their potential value as drug targets as well. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Compared with other major types of cancer such as colon,
prostate, and breast cancers, the clinical outcome of conventional
therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy still
remains poor despite the major efforts to improve treatment
methods during past decades. The most important reasons for
the lack of improvement in prognosis are the difficulties in making

the early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer and the high recurrence
rate after curative treatments (1). Thus, identification and validation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is tremendously
important to improve the clinical outcome of lung cancer treatments (2).
The emergence of high-throughput molecular tools such as
microarrays and large-scale databases of serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) and expressed sequence tags (EST) brought a
new paradigm for biomarker discovery. Numerous candidate biomarkers have been reported for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and for selection and monitoring of therapies
since the application of such new technologies and techniques had
been initiated (3). For example, microarrays have been successfully
applied to find new classes of diseases, to predict prognosis, and to
identify diagnostic markers for early detection (4). Typically, these
studies have used classifiers that consist of tens or hundreds of
genes. However, it is still not clear whether or not such molecular
signatures would be more effective than a few biomarkers of high
sensitivity and specificity.
SAGE is a sequencing-based technique for quantitatively
profiling the gene expression. Tag counts provide an estimation
of the expression levels in SAGE. The merit of the technique is that
it does not require any prior knowledge of the gene sequence, thus
generating unbiased profiling even for unknown genes (5). Metadata analysis is relatively simple due to the simple nature of the
data. Two research groups have used the SAGE technique to find
the differentially expressed genes as biomarkers for lung cancer
(6, 7).
EST is a relatively low-throughput technique as compared with
the microarray or SAGE techniques. However, the vast amount of
public data in dbEST makes it a valuable information source for
studying gene expression pattern as can be seen in the case of the
Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (8). In addition, several studies
have reported the successful application of EST data to find tissuespecific and/or cancer-specific genes (9).
SAGE and EST data are often complementary in their library
characteristics. Gene expression from EST is not quantitative
because preparation of many libraries has included normalization
or subtraction steps. SAGE provides a quantitative profile, but the
number of public libraries is rather small compared with the EST
cDNA libraries (f300 versus f8,600 for human). Furthermore,
the tag-to-gene assignment is not a trivial task in SAGE analysis.
Bioinformatics methods that integrate these public data, taking
merits and shortcomings of each into consideration, would significantly facilitate the discovery of biomarkers.
A major obstacle in finding biomarkers with using public
expression data is the problem of sample heterogeneity. Many
cDNA libraries from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project are from

bulk samples and cell lines. The coverage of SAGE libraries is quite
limited and, consequently, lacks statistical significance for valid
biomarkers. For example, only six SAGE libraries are publicly available for lung tissues, and their preparation protocols significantly
vary from one another. Thus, it is essential to critically validate
the predicted candidate markers using a number of well-defined
clinical samples. Investigating the molecular properties and pathways they are involved in may also be helpful for deciding the value
of the genes as drug targets in addition to biomarkers.
We describe here a bioinformatics method and clinical validation to identify diagnostic marker genes for lung cancer. The SAGE
and EST data were meta-analyzed to produce a list of differentially
expressed genes in lung cancers. A systematic examination of the
annotated gene properties led to 20 genes which were subjected
to experimental validation using clinical specimens from lung
cancer patients. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RTPCR) followed by extensive statistical analyses established seven
genes (CBLC, CYP24A1, ALDH3A1, AKR1B10, S100P, PLUNC, and
LOC147166) as the potential diagnostic markers for lung cancer.
Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were carried out with
additional samples for the seven identified markers as the final
validation step. We further describe the molecular properties of
these genes, especially their relationship to lung cancer and
regulatory signaling pathways, to examine their value beyond
diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

Materials and Methods
We used the ECgene system throughout the bioinformatics analyses.
ECgene is a novel algorithm that combines genome-based EST clustering
and graph-based transcript assembly procedures (10). Its EST clustering is
conceptually similar to the genome-based version of UniGene clustering.
The main advantage of ECgene is that it produces transcript models and
subclustering according to alternative splicing. Such mRNA models are
useful for assigning genes to SAGE tags.
The clustering algorithm is more conservative in terms of selecting valid
alignments and splice site sharing. Approximately 6% to 7% of ESTs in the
UniGene do not satisfy our conservative criteria of alignment. Additional 5%
or so of ESTs belong to different EST clusters, most of which turned out to
be neighboring clusters. We found that such ESTs aligned with the opposite
strand or in the intronic regions without sharing any splice sites.
Approximately 11% to 12% difference in EST members leads to a substantial
difference in the final result. The schematic overview of our approach is
given in Fig. 1.
Analysis of SAGE libraries. The SAGE Genie at the National Cancer
Institute Cancer Genome Anatomy Project contains six SAGE libraries from
lung tissues—three normal and three cancer-related libraries (11). Two of
the normal libraries were from cell lines and two of the cancer libraries were
from microdissected samples of lung adenocarcinoma. That some of the
samples were not from primary tissues whereas others were prepared in
bulk tissue form implies a lack of sample homogeneity. For the initial
screening of the differentially expressed genes, we nevertheless pooled all
six libraries into two groups: normal and cancer. The total number of tag
counts in each library was normalized to 1 million and the average value in
each group was used for a statistical test. Fisher’s exact test was used to
identify the differentially expressed tags. Tag-to-gene assignment is not
trivial when interpreting the SAGE result. EST-based method used in the
SAGEmap suffers from sequencing errors, alternative polyA site usage,
and lack of proper annotations (12). We used the ECgene mRNA models
for reliable tag-to-gene assignment. ECgene assembly procedure solves
most of the problems associated with the EST-based methods described
above (10).
EST analysis. We used the EST clusters from ECgene version 1.2 based
on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human genome
35. Approximately 7 million human EST sequences from more than 8,600

cDNA libraries are currently available in the GenBank. The total number
of lung ESTs from 304 cDNA libraries is 401,672 as of August 2006. The
diverse source of samples is one of the main advantages for meta-analysis
of EST data.
Each EST cluster was tested for its differential expression in the lung
tissue and in the cancerous tissue. Tissue specificity was tested separately
from cancer specificity using Fisher’s exact test. This approach has the
advantage of retaining clusters with limited numbers of lung cancer ESTs
that actually has a number of ESTs from normal lung tissue and other types
of cancer. Gene expression is often deregulated with tumor progression. It
would be reasonable to decide the cancer specificity regardless of their
tissue origin.
Sample description. The primary lung tumor tissues were obtained
from non–small-cell lung cancer patients who had undergone curative
surgery. Our study was approved by the institutional review board, and the
written informed consents were obtained from all patients (Institutional
Review Board no. 2004-10-18). Lung cancer tissues were obtained from
nonnecrotic tumor area. In each case, the normal parenchyma of the same
lobe not continuous with the tumor was selected as ‘‘pathologically normal’’
tissue. All the specimens were soaked in liquid nitrogen immediately after
resection and stored at 70jC.
Our clinical samples initially consisted of 11 adenocarcinoma, 11
squamous cell carcinoma, and 10 lung tissues from benign lung diseases.
The detailed characteristics of patients and the pathology are provided in
Table 1. Paired samples were obtained from primary lung cancer and the

adjacent normal tissues for validation tests. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
experiments were carried out for initial screening of biomarkers from 20
candidate genes using these 22 paired samples. The 10 lung tissues from
benign lung diseases were used as the control for noncancerous disease
states. In the final validation step, the real-time quantitative RT-PCR was
done for 7 biomarkers on 36 paired samples, which included 14 additional
paired samples (7 adenocarcinoma and 7 squamous cell carcinoma) and the
22 original paired samples.

RNA extraction. The frozen tissues were microdissected and lightly
stained with hematoxylin to identify the portion consisting of >90% cancer
cells. The total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The RNA
quality was assessed with the use of a Nanodrop spectrometer (Nanodrop
Technologies) and by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel that contained
0.6 mol/L formaldehyde and ethidium bromide.
RT-PCR experiment. The total RNA was isolated from 20-Am-thick
cryostat sections. Reverse transcription was carried out with 1 Ag of RNA,

50 Amol/L oligodT (20), 250 Amol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP),
10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase III
(Invitrogen), and 5 reverse transcriptase buffer in a total volume of 50 AL.
The PCR reactions were done using 1 AL (20 ng) of each cDNA, 250 nmol/L
dNTP, 10 pmol/L of each primer, and 2 units of i-StarTag polymerase (Intron
Biotechnology, Inc.). The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in the
experiment are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The results were
expressed as the ratio of the relative levels.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiment. The cDNA used for
quantitative real-time RT-PCR was prepared in the same manner as in the
semiquantitative RT-PCR experiment. We used the FAM dye–labeled
TaqMan MGB probes (Applied Biosystems). Each probe was designed to
be specific to the seven final candidate genes (see above). In addition, TATA
box binding protein–specific probe was used as internal control. The PCR
reaction mixture consists of the reverse transcription product, TaqMan
2 Universal PCR Master Mix, and the appropriate 20 TaqMan Gene
expression assay mix containing primers and probe for the gene of interest.
Cycle variables for the PCR reaction were 50jC for 2 min (UNG activation)
and then 95jC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of a denaturing step at
95jC for 15 s and an annealing/extension step at 60jC for 60 s. All reactions were run in triplicates. The relative expression values of each
gene to internal control gene were analyzed using the equation 2 dC T,
where dC T = (C Ttarget gene C Tinternal control gene) (ref. 13).
Statistical analyses for biomarker evaluation. We measured the DNA
band intensity using the BioRAD densitometer (Bio-Rad). The ANOVA
statistical tests with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison method were
done to find the differentially expressed genes between the benign disease
tissues and cancer tissues. The paired t test was done to identify the
differentially expressed genes between the pathologic normal and cancer
tissues from each of the patients. Differences were considered significant
at P < 0.05.
We also carried out the feature selection procedures that are frequently
used to identify important features in classification problems. All samples
were classified into the normal and cancer classes. The gene expression
values of 20 genes were used as an input data. We applied three feature
selection methods to identify the most important genes for classifying
normal and tumor samples. The support vector machine classifier, m2 test
statistics, and gain ratio methods were used as implemented in the WEKA
package (14). Parameters were set as the default values in the WEKA and
the 5-fold cross-validation was done with the constraint seed of 1. The
search method was set as the ranker.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Candidate Genes from Public Gene
Expression Data
The public SAGE and EST data were analyzed according to the
bioinformatics pipeline in Fig. 1 to find the candidate genes for
subsequent statistical analyses. The details were given in Materials
and Methods. Statistical tests produced several hundreds of
candidates that were differentially expressed in lung cancers at
P = 0.01. Because the sample amount of the clinical specimen
was limited, we selected 20 genes for experimental validation, taking the characteristics of the data and gene properties into consideration.
The SAGE data yielded the following 10 genes: MUC5AC, TFF3,
PLUNC, CYBA, CGI-38, GBA, S100P, s-TIM, s-C20orf85, and CYP24A1
(details given in Supplementary Table S2). We used the following
criteria for gene selection: (a) the availability of full-length clones;
(b) no ambiguity in the tag-to-gene assignment; (c) the P values
and the real tag counts in six libraries; (d) the gene properties; and
(e) the literature survey.
Similarly, another set of 10 genes resulted from the EST analyses:
ALDH3A1, TRIM16, AKR1B10, T, LOC147166, FOXA2, SCTR, DRD2,
CBLC, and GLP2R (Supplementary Table S3). We used the criteria

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

of (a) the number of ESTs and cDNA libraries, (b) multiplicity
of exons, (c) the percentage of lung and cancer ESTs and libraries,
and (d) the gene properties. In contrast to the SAGE data, the vast
number of cDNA libraries makes it possible to use the tissue and
cancer specificities as filtering criteria.
We specifically looked for genes that were up-regulated in the
cancer samples because most of the known biomarkers for cancer
diagnostics are the overexpressed ones (15). The reliability of gene
annotation was also taken into account. To identify markers with
testable biological functions, the unknown genes and immunerelated genes were excluded in spite of their potential as good biomarkers. Full lists of the differentially expressed genes from SAGE
and EST data are available in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8.
Comparing the candidate gene lists from SAGE and EST reveals
that the overlap is not significant. This is frequently seen when the
number of available libraries for one of the two data set is small.
Only six libraries are in public for lung SAGE. A close examination of SAGE candidate genes shows that four genes (PLUNC,
CGI-38, s-C20orf85, and GBA) would have been in the EST candidates without application of the specificity criteria.
Comparison with microarray data. Results from microarray
experiments are the most abundant form of gene expression data.
The expression level of the 20 candidate genes was compared with
the public microarray data. We simply used the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database from the NCBI (16) and the ONCOMINE
database developed by Chinnaiyan’s group (17).
The GEO serves as a public repository for a wide variety of highthroughput gene expression data from microarray, SAGE, and
proteomic methods. We looked for the data sets whose characteristics are similar to our study design, comparing the normal and
tumor tissues from lung cancer patients. The GEO search resulted
in a data set (GDS1312) revealing differential expression between
paired samples from 10 squamous cell carcinoma patients (18).
The data set showed that 3 of the 10 SAGE candidates (CYP24A1,
S100P, and PLUNC) and 4 of the 10 EST candidates (CBLC,
ALDH3A1, AKR1B10, and TRIM16) were overexpressed in the tumor
samples. However, several genes (CGI-38, CYBA, TFF3, GBA, and
FOXA2) were down-regulated in the tumor samples contrary to
our prediction.
The ONCOMINE provides a comprehensive interpretation of
published microarray experiments including three pioneering
works on lung cancer (19–21). Beer et al. compared nonneoplastic
lung tissues with lung adenocarcinoma (10 nonneoplastic versus 86
adenocarcinoma tissues). Bhattacharjee et al. compared 17 normal
lung tissues with 139 lung adenocarcinoma samples. Analysis of the
data showed that three genes (S100P, s-TIM, and TFF3) were
overexpressed in lung tumor samples compared with normal
samples. CYBA was underexpressed in lung cancer samples in
ONCOMINE database as well.
Comparison with the microarray data indicates that our
prediction based on SAGE and EST data agrees to a significant
extent with the microarray data. However, there exists substantial
difference between three types of high-throughput expression data.
This implies that experimental validation using well-defined
clinical samples is an essential step for definitively identifying
biomarkers.

Experimental Validation of the Candidate Biomarker
Genes
The validation procedure consists of two steps. Initially, semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments were done for the 20 candidate

Lung Cancer Markers from Public Expression Data

genes using 22 paired samples and 10 inflammatory tissues. Seven
genes were selected from extensive statistical analyses of RT-PCR
results. Subsequently, quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments
were carried out for the seven genes using 36 paired samples,
which included the original 22 paired samples and additional 14
paired samples.
RT-PCR results. We carried out semiquantitative RT-PCR
experiments for the 20 candidate genes selected from the SAGE
and EST analyses. Among the 10 genes from EST analysis, 6 genes
(T, FOXA2, SCTR, GLP2R, TRIM16, and DRD2) were immediately
excluded from further validation efforts because these genes were
not detected in any of the lung tissue. This may reflect the fact that
many EST libraries were normalized or subtracted to detect even
the genes with extremely low level expression. Most ESTs for two of
the genes (SCTR and GLP2R) in fact are from normalized libraries.
The reason for the discrepancy for other genes is not clear. We
finally evaluated 14 genes in 10 inflammatory tissues and 22 paired
cancer tissues by RT-PCR (Fig. 2).
The results of the RT-PCR experiment were quantified and
appropriate statistical tests were done to identify the differentially
expressed genes as described in Materials and Methods. Table 2
shows the number of samples in which each gene showed a
positive expression ( for details, see Supplementary Tables S4
and S5). From the three types of samples used in this study—
benign disease tissues, pathologic normal tissues, and lung cancer
tissues—we made two separate statistical comparisons. The first
was to compare the lung cancer tissues with the benign lung
tissues. Using benign lung tissues from other patients as a control
ensures that the samples were genuinely normal notwithstanding
that the differential expression might be due to the genetic
differences among individuals. The ANOVA statistical comparison
between the tumor tissues and the benign disease tissues identified
four genes as overexpressed in tumor tissues: CBLC (P = 0.007),
S100P (P = 0.012), CYP24A1 (P = 0.022), and ALDH3A1 (P = 0.024).
Detailed histologic examinations indicated that the first three
genes (CBLC, S100P, and CYP24A1 ) were overexpressed in
adenocarcinoma tissue and ALDH3A1 was overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma tissue. Second, we compared lung cancer
tissues with the pathologic normal tissues from the same patient.
The genetic background was identical although the pathologic
normal tissues might be different from the genuine normal
condition. The paired t test was done to identify seven genes that
were overexpressed in tumor tissues compared with the paired

pathologic normal tissues: CBLC (P < 0.001), S100P (P = 0.005),
CYP24A1 (P = 0.002), ALDH3A1 (P = 0.001), PLUNC (P = 0.003),
AKR1B10 (P = 0.012), and LOC147166 (P = 0.012). Importantly, four
genes obtained from the first comparison showed differential
expression in this paired comparison as well, and three additional
genes were identified.
We also applied the feature selection methods that are frequently
used to select discriminatory features for classification problems in
the field of the machine learning. Samples were divided into two
classes, and three methods were applied to select genes that
effectively discriminates the normal and tumor samples. Details
are given in Materials and Methods. Table 3 shows the six highest
ranking genes from each method of 14 genes from the semiquantitative RT-PCR results. Top three genes were invariant to
the choice of algorithms, which indicated that CBLC, ALDH3A1,
and CYP24A1 are potentially excellent biomarkers. PLUNC and
LOC147166 ranked between the fourth and the sixth candidates in
all three methods, suggestive of their potential.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results. Quantitative real-time
RT-PCR experiments were done for seven genes (CBLC, S100P,
CYP24A1, ALDH3A1, PLUNC, AKR1B10, and LOC147166 ) that
showed significant differences in RT-PCR experiments. Patient
samples include the initial 22 and 14 additional paired sets. Details
of clinical characteristics are provided in Table 1, and the
experimental result is given in Supplementary Table S6.
The results of the experiment according to the paired t test
indicate that five genes—CBLC (P = 0.002), S100P (P = 0.031),
CYP24A1 (P = 0.027), AKR1B10 (P = 0.035), and LOC147166 (P =
0.007)—were significantly overexpressed in tumor samples. In
terms of the disease type, CBLC was significant in both tumor
tissues. S100P was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissues,
whereas ALDH3A1, AKR1B10, and LOC147166 were overexpressed
in squamous cell carcinoma tissues.
Figure 3 shows the box plot analysis of the real-time RT-PCR
results. For each gene, median fold change and distribution were
analyzed for all samples together and separately for the two
different cancer types. Consistent with the t test, CBLC stands out
as the most probable biomarker for both types of lung cancers.
CYP24A1 also seems to be a viable general biomarker for lung
cancers. For adenocarcinoma, PLUNC and S100P also seem to be
potential biomarkers, whereas AKR1B10 and ALDH3A1 seem to be
likely candidates for squamous cell carcinoma. Importantly, when
quantitated separately, the 22 original samples from which the

NOTE: The numbers in the table indicate the number of total samples where the candidate gene is expressed in the semiquantitative RT-PCR
experiment.

7 candidate genes were derived and the new 14 samples which
could be considered as the validation set showed little difference in
terms of fold change.
The result of analyzing the real-time PCR data using the feature
selection methods is also included in Table 3. Again, CBLC is the
most significant marker, followed by CYP24A1 and AKR1B10.
ALDH3A1 scored poorly because its expression was suppressed in
several newly tested samples.
Critical evaluation of biomarker genes. Inspecting the details
of gene expression shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 provides deeper
insights on the biomarker evaluation. The CBLC gene, the most
significant marker according to the statistical tests, was expressed
in just two normal samples (1 in 10 benign lung disease tissues,
1 in 11 pathologic normal tissues from the adenocarcinoma
patients, and none from the squamous cell carcinoma patient

tissues). In contrast, most cancer tissues showed a positive
expression for this gene (7 of 11 in the adenocarcinoma tissues
and 8 of 11 in the squamous cell carcinoma tissues). In 35 of 36
cases, real-time RT-PCR analysis showed elevated expression in
tumor samples, which strongly indicates that CBLC is a highly
specific and sensitive cancer biomarker.
CYP24A1 also showed similar degree of specificity and
sensitivity. Interestingly, two inflammatory tissues from benign
lung disease cases showed positive expression although CYP24A1
was not expressed in any pathologically normal tissues from 22
cancer patients. This indicates that CYP24A1 could be an excellent
marker for distinguishing normal and tumor tissues in paired
samples but its expression can be induced in other types of lung
diseases. Although the result from the real-time RT-PCR experiment, with 4 of 33 cases showing suppressed expression in tumor

Lung Cancer Markers from Public Expression Data

Figure 3. Box plot of quantitative real-time
RT-PCR results. Fold changes among 36
paired samples (ALL ), 18 adenocarcinoma
samples (ADC ), and 18 squamous cell
carcinoma samples (SCC ) are plotted in
logarithmic scale. Score of zero in this
scale implies no change, whereas score of
1 indicates a 10-fold change. The box area
contains 50% of the data samples, and
99.3% of the samples are within the upper
and lower boundary markers. The best
biomarkers would show the highest score
and smallest-sized box (e.g., CBLC ).

samples, is not as impressive as the semiquantitative RT-PCR
data, CYP24A1 still seems to be a promising biomarker for lung
cancers.
Although S100P showed a good statistical correlation, it does not
seem to be a good marker because about half of the normal
samples showed its expression. Furthermore, S100P scored poorly
in feature selection methods. The box plot in Fig. 3 nevertheless
indicates that S100P might be a good biomarker for adenocarcinoma subtype of lung cancer. ALDH3A1 seemed to perform much
better for its overall ability to distinguish cancer samples. The
numbers were even more impressive for the squamous cell
carcinoma patients (1 versus 10). Real-time RT-PCR data are
consistent with these observations.
Among three additional genes obtained from the paired sample
test, AKR1B10 and PLUNC had a small tendency to be preferentially
expressed in cancer samples than over normal samples, but their
merit as biomarkers was not obvious in the RT-PCR result.
However, real-time data strongly support AKR1B10 as a promising
candidate. In fact, all 14 additional samples showed increased
expression in cancer tissues, whereas the original 22 samples had a
mixed tendency. Similarly, PLUNC seems to have a fair potential as
a biomarker for adenocarcinoma, with 16 of 18 samples showing
elevated expression in cancer tissues.
In summary, we propose that the four genes (CBLC, CYP24A,
AKR1B10, and ALDH3A1) that showed significant differences in
both statistical tests and the RT-PCR validations are potential
biomarkers for non–small-cell lung cancer patients. Two genes
(CBLC and CYP24A1) are particularly promising. With respect to
the histopathologic aspects, these genes were expressed in both
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that
they are not cancer type–specific markers.
Biological properties of the candidate genes. Biomarker
discovery does not necessarily require understanding the biological

function and regulatory mechanism of the candidate genes.
However, molecular understanding of the biological function could
still be worthwhile in that overexpression of these genes may be
mechanistically linked to carcinogenesis. We therefore surveyed the
literature and the knowledge databases such as Entrez Gene (22),
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (23), and TransPath Professional 7.3
(24) on the two most promising genes.
CBLC is a member of the Cbl family of multidomain signaling
proteins with a tyrosine kinase binding domain and a RING finger
domain, the latter of which interacts with the E2 ubiquitin
conjugating enzymes of the ubiquitin pathway (25). Thus, the Cbl
family gene products function as ubiquitin ligases toward activated
protein tyrosine kinases such as Src (26) and Lck (27). CBLC is also
known to bind to proteins with the Src homology-3 domain as well.
It is recruited to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor
(EGFR) on EGF stimulation and increases ubiquitination of EGFR,
thereby down-regulating EGFR signaling (28, 29). Mutations in the
EGFR gene have been reported in non–small-cell lung cancer
patients, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma, women,
nonsmokers, and East Asians (30).
CYP24A1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of
enzymes involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. This mitochondrial protein initiates
the degradation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the physiologically
active form of vitamin D3. Albertson et al. (31) reported that gene
copy number and expression are increased in breast cancer, and
Mimori et al. (32) showed that its overexpression is linked to
a poor prognosis for esophageal cancer. At the time of writing,
Parise et al. (33) reported up-regulation of CYP24A1 in non–
small-cell lung cancer. The promoter region of CYP24A1 contains
two vitamin D response elements and an Ets-1 binding site
(34). Its gene regulation is a complicated process involving
vitamin D response, Ets-1, retinoid X receptor a, and various

mitogen-activated protein kinases such as extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK5. A number of studies have
reported that Ets-1 is a proto-oncogene in various types of cancer.

Conclusion
In this study, we identified candidate biomarkers for lung
cancers through bioinformatics analysis of the public SAGE and
EST data and validated their potential using clinical specimens.
CBLC and CYP24A1 are two particularly promising biomarkers
for non–small-cell lung cancer. Other genes (ALDH3A1, AKR1B10,
and LOC147166) seem to have fair potential as well.
It is interesting to note the origin of biomarker genes. Two
genes (CYP24A1 and S100P) were derived from SAGE data and
others (CBLC, ALDH3A1, AKR1B10, and LOC147166) were from the
EST data. This implies different ranges of coverage for the two
data sets and the benefits of using both types of data. Our study
also shows that candidates from meta-analysis of the public
expression data should be carefully tested through validation
using clinical samples.

One of the major strengths of our study is the use of multiple
clinical samples. Strong statistical support was thus possible
although additional clinical samples should be used for further
validation down the road. In addition, we tested only 20 genes in
this study with several hundreds of candidates remaining to be
examined. Biochemical studies for promising biomarkers are
necessary as well to examine the potential of the candidate genes
as drug targets. As additional expression data become available, it
would be also be interesting to see if combinations of several
differentially regulated genes could function with more sensitivity
and specificity in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancers.
