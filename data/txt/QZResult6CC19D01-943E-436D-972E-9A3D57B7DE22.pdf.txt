ABSTRACT:
Constitutively activated signaling molecules are often the primary drivers of
malignancy, and are favored targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the
effectiveness of targeted inhibition of cell signaling can be blunted by compensatory
signaling which generates adaptive resistance mechanisms and reduces therapeutic
responses. Therefore, it is important to identify and target these compensatory
pathways with combinations of targeted agents to achieve durable clinical benefit. In
this report, we demonstrate the use of high-throughput combinatorial drug screening
as a discovery tool to identify compensatory pathways that generate resistance to
the cytotoxic effects of targeted therapy. We screened 420 drug combinations in 14
different cell lines representing three cancer lineages, and assessed the ability of
each combination to cause synergistic cytotoxicity. Drug substitution studies were
used to validate the functionally important drug targets. Of the 84 combinations
that caused robust synergy in multiple cell lines, none were synergistic in more than
half of the lines tested, and we observed no pattern of lineage specificity in the
observed synergies. This reflects the plasticity of cell signaling networks, even among
cell lines of the same tissue of origin. Mechanistic analysis of one novel synergistic
combination identified in the screen, the multi-kinase inhibitor Ro31-8220 and
lapatinib, demonstrated compensatory crosstalk between the p70S6 kinase and EGF
receptor pathways. In addition, we identified BAD as a node of convergence between
these two pathways that may be playing a role in the enhanced apoptosis observed
upon combination treatment.

INTRODUCTION

both primary and acquired resistance to targeted therapies
[4,5].
Resistance can be caused by the activity of
alternative signaling pathways that compensate for
the pathways being inhibited by the therapeutic agent
(reviewed in [6,7]). Due to the robustness of the signaling
networks, it will be necessary to inhibit not only the
primary drivers of oncogenesis, but also one or more of the
compensatory signaling modules. We term these secondary
drivers “backseat drivers”. Identifying these secondary
targets represents a major challenge in developing rational

Dysregulation of cell signaling networks caused
by mutationally altered proteins drives the biological
transformations that constitute the hallmarks of cancer
[1]. Identification of these oncogenic drivers provides an
opportunity for therapeutic intervention using targeted
agents [2]. Unfortunately, in most advanced cancers the
therapeutic responses to targeted agents are partial and not
durable [3]. Increasing evidence points to the robustness
of cell signaling networks as a substantial component of

combinations of targeted drugs. We previously reported
that some compensatory responses could be identified by
analysis of phosphoproteomic or gene expression changes
that occur in response to single drug treatment [4].
However, the diversity of these changes and our limited
knowledge of how signaling pathways are laterally linked
into functional networks makes it difficult to predict what
the most appropriate target(s) would be for co-inhibition.
Moreover, the limited repertoire of targets utilized for drug
development [8] makes it difficult to rationally construct
drug combinations that could have near-term clinical
utility.
To identify targetable compensatory pathways that
could guide the construction of potentially useful drug
combinations, we have performed robotic screens with
a library of targeted agents, singly and in combination,
and identified combinations that caused synergistic
cytotoxicity. We focused on synergistic combinations
because they point to mechanistic linkages between the
signaling pathways, and also because of the possibility
of improved therapeutic index in vivo. In assembling
the library we emphasized use of FDA-approved drugs,
drugs in clinical trials, and tool compounds that inhibit
equivalent and validated targets. We [9] and others
[10] have utilized panels of B-Raf, N-Ras and double
wild-type melanomas and shown that unexpected
synergistic combinations could be identified by screening
combinations of targeted agents. In this communication,
we expand and refine the screening approach using a
panel of epithelial cancer cell lines. Drug combinations
identified using this screening technique were then
tested in a series of follow-up experiments to verify the
targets of the inhibitors, and determine a mechanism of
compensatory interaction between the pathways being
inhibited. We identified expected combinations (e.g. PI3
kinase and EGF receptor pathway inhibitors), which
provided a validation of the approach. We also identified
novel, unexpected combinations, some of which may have
potential for clinical development. Mechanistic analyses
of one of these novel combinations, a p70S6 kinase
inhibitor and an EGF receptor inhibitor, identified BAD
phosphorylation as a terminal node of convergence of the
pathways being inhibited

and dephosphorylation, and also general chemotherapeutic
agents. Each of these inhibitors was tested in combination
with seven “primary” inhibitors, which were selected
based on a literature search of commonly drugged targets
in various cancers. This approach gave us a matrix of 420
drug combinations, which were tested in fourteen cancer
cell lines, representing three distinct epithelial cancer
lineages (prostate cancer (CaP), bladder cancer (BC),
and head and neck cancer (HNC)). Three CaP cell lines
(LNCaP, C4-2, and RV-1) tested are known to express
and be dependent on the androgen receptor [11-13]. Since
androgen deprivation is a standard of care for prostate
cancer patients, we assessed the responses of these
cell lines in both the presence and absence of R1881, a
synthetic androgen, in order to better recapitulate the in
vivo conditions associated with therapy of this type of
cancer.
The levels of cytotoxicity generated by each
individual drug treatment and drug combination were
assayed using alamarBlue, and synergy was assessed
by the Bliss independence method [12]. The differences
between the Bliss model predictions for additivity and the
actual level of cytotoxicity, a value we term the ‘percent
synergy,’ were determined for every drug combination
tested in each cell line. These data were plotted
(Figure 1A) and a cutoff was set for the top 5%, which
corresponded to 30% synergy. (i.e. the actual amount of
cytotoxicity was at least 30% greater than an additive
interaction predicted by Bliss Independence). The majority
of the “hits” (39%) caused between 30 – 35% synergy. As
the magnitude of the synergy increased, the proportion of
hits decreased (Figure 1B). Strikingly, not one of these
combinations resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in more
than half the cell lines, with the majority of hits (58%)
occurring in only one cell line (Figure 1C). In addition, no
combination that resulted in synergy in more than 2 cell
lines was lineage specific. The diversity of these responses
to treatment undoubtedly reflects the diverse architecture
of the underlying cell signaling networks, and the ways the
genetic context of these cells alters responses to individual
targets. Analysis of common oncogenic mutations (Figure
1D) did not reveal any underlying genetic changes that
could be used to predict sensitivity to any of the synergistic
drug combinations.
We then chose three combinations for further study.
The combination of AG1478/LY294002 was selected
because the synergistic interaction between EGF receptor
and PI3 kinase inhibitors has been well documented in
other model systems (ex. [14]), making this combination
a useful proof-of-principle for the screening and validation
methodology (Figure 2A)). The combinations of NDGA/
TSA (5-Lipoxygenase inhibitor/HDAC inhibitor) and
AG1478/Ro318220
(EGFR
inhibitor/multi-kinase
inhibitor) were selected due to their occurrence in multiple
cell lines and the novelty of the interactions between the
pathways that these drugs inhibit (Figures 2B and 2C).

RESULTS
Chemical genetic synthetic lethal screening
identifies drug combinations causing synergistic
cytotoxicity. To identify pathways that can compensate
for blockade of an oncogenic target, we performed a
combinatorial synthetic lethal screen utilizing a library
of sixty targeted small molecule inhibitors. Some of
the inhibitors are approved drugs, some are in clinical
development and others are tool compounds. The library
contained protein kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of other
enzymatic processes such as deacetylation, methylation

Drug substitution experiments confirm the targets
necessary for synergistic cytotoxicity. Small molecule
drugs often inhibit the activity of proteins other than their
primary target [15]. In order to test whether these “offtarget” effects were responsible for the synergy observed
in the screen, we performed follow-up growth assays
using other inhibitors of the same putative targets as the
drugs used in the initial screen. For the combination of
AG1478/LY294002, we used lapatinib or gefitinib as
substitute EGF receptor inhibitors and NVP-BEZ235 or
wortmannin as substitute PI3 kinase inhibitors. We tested

these compounds in UMUC-6 cells. A range of lapatinib
concentrations combined with 100 nM BEZ235 resulted in
significant synergy, confirming the screen results (Figure
3A). In addition, the combinations of AG1478/BEZ235
(Figure 3B) and lapatinib/LY294002 (Figure 3C) were
able to recapitulate the synergy observed in the screen.
The combinations of gefitinib (EGF receptor)/LY294002
and wortmannin (PI3 kinase)/AG1478 also produced
enhanced cytotoxicity (Supplemental Figure S1). These
results confirm the identification of EGF receptor and
PI3 kinase as the functional targets responsible for the

the functionally important targets for the NDGA/TSA
synergy remain unknown.
Lastly, to confirm the necessity of EGF receptor
inhibition for synergy in combination with Ro31-8220,
we again substituted lapatinib for AG1478. We found
that lapatinib caused significant synergy in three bladder
cancer lines (KU-7, UMUC-3 and UMUC-6) and trended
towards significance in a fourth (253-J) (Fig. 3K). We also
tested nine concentration combinations of lapatinib/Ro318220 in KU-7 cells and found significant synergy over a
range of concentrations of both drugs (Figure 3L).
Flow cytometry analysis determines the biological
effects of synergistic drug combinations. To identify the
biological endpoints of the synergistic cytotoxicities,
we measured effects on apoptosis, proliferation, and cell
cycle progression by flow cytometry. In UMUC-6 cells,
treatment with 500 nM lapatinib or 100 nM BEZ235
alone had minimal effects on apoptosis and proliferation,
but treatment with the combination caused a synergistic
increase in apoptosis and decrease in proliferation (Figure
4 A-D). Similarly, KU-7 cells treated with lapatinib or
Ro31-8220 and UMUC-3 cells treated with NDGA or TSA
demonstrated little change in the levels of apoptosis. In
both cases, however, combination treatment resulted in a
significant increase in apoptosis (Figure 4 E-G). The robust
apoptosis generated by the NDGA/TSA combination
makes it appealing for further study to determine whether
it may be useful therapeutically. However, in agreement

synergistic small molecule interactions.
We next examined the combination of NDGA/TSA.
In order to confirm the synergy observed in the screen,
we tested this combination in three cell lines; UMUC-3,
FaDu, and RV-1. This combination reproducibly resulted
in significant synergy in UMUC-3 and FaDu and trended
towards synergy in RV-1 (Figure 3D). However, in
contrast to the studies with the EGFR/PI3K inhibitors,
drug substitutions failed to validate the putative target
for either agent. The 5-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein
(FLAP) inhibitor MKK-886, the 5-Lox inhibitor AA-861,
the 12- and 15-Lox inhibitor baicalein, and the IGFR
inhibitor AG1024 failed to replicate the synergizing
properties of NDGA (Figure 3E-3H for UMUC-3 and
Supplemental Figures S2 A-D and S3 A-D for FaDu and
RV-1, respectively). We also tested whether other HDAC
inhibitors could substitute for TSA to cause synergy in
combination with NDGA including SAHA (Vorinostat)
and sodium butyrate. These inhibitors were tested at
both concentrations that caused increases in histone H3
acetylation similar to the concentrations of TSA that
resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity (data not shown), as
well as concentrations that were comparable or exceeded
those found in the plasma of human patients treated
[16,17] with these drugs (Figure 3 I and J, Supplemental
Figures S2I, S2J, S3I and S3J). Neither of these inhibitors
was able to cause synergy in combination with NDGA
(Figure 3I-3J for UMUC-3 and Supplemental Figures S2
E-F and S3 E-F for FaDu and RV-1, respectively). Thus,

(Fig 4 E-F). The lack of specificity of the inhibitors

mechanisms and the inability of clinically useful HDAC

combination for further mechanistic analysis based on its
novelty and the challenges presented in utilizing a multikinase inhibitor in developing combinatorial targeted
therapies. Ro31-8220 is related to staurosporine and
UCN-01, and was developed as a PKC inhibitor [18].
However, it inhibits the activity of a number of protein
kinases including p70S6 kinase [15], which we have
observed to be an important node in other synergistic
drug interactions (Axelrod, et. al – under revision). To
determine whether Ro31-8220 was inhibiting the activity
of p70S6 kinase in KU-7 cells, we treated the cells with
increasing concentrations of Ro31-8220. This treatment
resulted in concentration dependent decreases in S6
phosphorylation at serines 240 and 244 (S240/S244).
In contrast, activating p70S6 kinase phosphorylations
at threonine 389 (T389), threonine 421, and serine 424
(T421/S424) were increased in a concentration dependent
manner (Figure 5A), presumably reflecting a de-inhibition
of upstream kinases by relief of feedback inhibition. These
data indicate that Ro31-8220 is a direct inhibitor of p70S6

upstream pathway activity at concentrations sufficient to
inhibit p70S6 kinase activation.
To determine whether p70S6 kinase inhibition was
sufficient to obtain synergy with lapatinib, we tested
the utility of AT7867, a structurally distinct multikinase
inhibitor. AT7867 has a different target profile from
Ro31-8220, however p70S6 kinase is the only published
target shared by these two drugs [15,19]. As with Ro318220, treatment of KU-7 cells with AT7867 resulted in
a concentration dependent decrease in pS6, indicating
that p70S6 kinase activity was in fact being inhibited by
AT7867 (Figure 5B), and the combination of AT7867 with
lapatinib resulted in synergistic cytoxicity (Figure 5C).
These results strengthen the link between p70S6 kinase
inhibition and cell growth inhibition.
Since AT7867 inhibits kinases other than p70S6
kinase, we used RNAi to reduce p70S6 kinase expression
and determined the effects of this knockdown on lapatinib
sensitivity. KU-7 cells were stably infected with a

p70S6 Kinase is likely an essential component of the
cytotoxic effects of this combination.
p70S6 kinase inhibition leads to EGF receptor
dependent compensatory signaling through ERK. To
understand the molecular mechanism of the synergistic
cytotoxicity from the combination of EGF receptor and
p70S6 kinase inhibition, we analyzed the compensatory
signals elicited by inhibition of these targets. Treatment
with either Ro31-8220 or AT7867 alone resulted in an
increase in ERK phosphorylation. These increases were
blocked by the addition of lapatinib, indicating that the
increased ERK pathway signaling was dependent upon
EGF receptor activity (Figure 6 A-B). We also noted
that the addition of lapatinib enhanced the inhibition of
S6 phosphorylation caused by AT7867 (Figure 6 A&C).
To test whether increased ERK activation was part of the
compensatory pathway providing resistance to cytotoxicity

in response to p70S6 kinase inhibition, we tested the
effects of combined p70S6 kinase and MEK inhibition
using AT7867 and PD325901, a selective MEK inhibitor.
KU-7 cells were treated with these two compounds singly
or in combination for 72 hours. The combination resulted
in a synergistic increase in cytotoxicity (Figure 6D). These
data indicate that inhibition of p70S6 kinase in KU-7 cells
results in an EGF receptor-dependent, compensatory
increase in ERK signaling that provided resistance to
cytotoxicity caused by p70S6 kinase inhibition alone.
We further examined this compensatory signaling
pathway by Western blotting of KU-7 cells treated with
vehicle control, 5 µM AT7867, 7.5 µM lapatinib, or the
combination for one hour. In agreement with our previous
data, treatment with AT7867 caused a robust increase in
ERK phosphorylation that was inhibited by lapatinib
treatment (Figure 7 A&C). Lapatinib treatment also

synergistically regulated. The pro-apoptotic protein BAD,
which is known to be downstream of both p70S6 kinase
and ERK signaling, was a logical candidate [20,21].
We immunoprecipitated total BAD protein from the
same lysates that were used for analysis of ERK and S6
phosphorylation. Probing these immunoprecipitates with
a BAD phospho-specific antibody, we found that while
single drug treatments did not have a significant effect
on BAD phosphorylation, the combination caused a
synergistic decrease in phosphorylation (Figure 7 A&B),
which allows it to perform a pro-apoptotic function [22].

phosphoproteomic responses despite the common links of
B-Raf mutation and synergistic cytotoxic. This diversity of
responses to combination treatment strongly suggests that
the unique cell signaling networks and genetic context of
each cell line play a crucial role in the response of these
cells to targeted therapies.
Our pathway discovery screen identified both
expected and novel pathway interactions. In order to
validate the screen, we first analyzed one of the expected
hits: inhibition of EGF receptor combined with inhibition
of PI3 kinase signaling. Using a drug substitution
paradigm, we confirmed that inhibition of EGF receptor
and PI3 kinase resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity
irrespective of the drug used to inhibit each target. Then,
using multi-variate flow cytometry, we found that dual
inhibition of EGF receptor and PI3 kinase signaling
pathways resulted in both a synergistic decrease in
proliferation and a synergistic increase in apoptosis. These
results confirmed those of the growth assays, which used
the metabolic readout of alamarBlue.
We next examined two novel pathway interactions
identified in the screen. The first was the combination of
NDGA and TSA. NDGA, and its derivative terameprocol,
are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for both
leukemia and solid tumors such as prostate cancer (ex.
NCT00678015, NCT00664677). The putative target for
these drugs is 5-Lipoxygenase [23], although other targets
have also been reported, including the IGF receptor [24].
TSA is a tool compound that has been shown to inhibit
the activity of histone deacetylases. The NDGA/TSA
combination produced robust synergy in seven of the 14
cell lines tested in the screen, spanning all three cancer
lineages that were represented. Follow-up growth assays
and flow cytometry staining for apoptosis confirmed the
synergistic effect of this drug combination, making this
a very attractive combination from the perspective of
biological endpoints. Unfortunately, we were unable to
identify the targets of these drugs whose inhibition was
sufficient to result in synergy. Combining other inhibitors
of the 5-Lox pathway, as well as other Lox family
inhibitors and inhibitors of other published NDGA targets,
with TSA did not produce synergy in any of the cell lines
tested.
Similarly, the substitution of HDAC inhibitors that
are either clinically approved (SAHA/Vorinostat, Valproic
acid, Sodium butyrate) or in clinical trials (Panobinostat)
also failed to recapitulate the synergy observed with the
NDGA/TSA combination. The inability of SAHA to
substitute for TSA was particularly surprising, given the
structural similarities between the two compounds [25].
The failure of these drugs to substitute for TSA indicates
that, even though each is a “HDAC inhibitor” it is likely
that each has a different profile of functionally significant
molecular targets. Over fifty non-histone protein substrates
of HDAC family members have been identified [26],
making the functionally significant target(s) for synergy

DISCUSSION
We and others have hypothesized that compensatory
signaling pathways are induced in response to
treatment with targeted cancer therapies, and that these
compensatory signals can contribute to therapeutic
resistance [6,7,9,10]. The compensatory pathways thus
present a requirement and an opportunity for therapeutic
intervention. Combined targeting of both the primary
oncogenic driver as well as one or more compensatory
“backseat drivers” should result in a greater anti-tumor
effect than single agent treatment alone.
In this work, we present a technique for identifying
combinations of primary and “backseat” drivers
through the use of high-throughput combinatorial drug
screening. This pathway discovery screen allowed us to
find combinations of targeted therapies that produced
synergistic growth inhibition. A synergistic interaction
implies interconnectedness between the two pathways
being inhibited. The overall concept is supported by the
complementary compensatory signaling we show occurs
when p70S6 kinase and EGF receptor are inhibited
separately, and the synergistic cytotoxicity seen when
both targets are inhibited simultaneously. The relationship
between synergy and crosstalk stands in contrast to a
purely additive interaction, which would result from the
inhibition of two completely separate pathways.
In each of 14 cell lines we assessed the growth
effects of 420 drug combinations using the Bliss model
to assess synergy. Analyses of these data revealed that
none of the combinations caused synergy in more than
7 cell lines, nor did any of the combinations display
lineage-specific synergy. In addition, none of the common
oncogenic mutations we examined in these cell lines could
be used to predict synergistic responses to any of the
combinations. A recent combinatorial drug study by Held,
et al. identified drug combinations that were specific for
sub-groups of melanoma characterized by their Raf and
Ras mutational status [10]. Even within these subgroups,
however, the responses to these combinations were not
universal. In addition, research from our own laboratory
(Roller et al., in preparation) on a panel of BRAF mutant
melanoma cell lines treated with vemurafenib and
lapatinib revealed varied responses in transcriptional and

and cytotoxicity difficult to identify. Since we were unable
to find a drug that is FDA-approved or being used in
clinical trials to substitute for TSA, nor were we able to
identify the functional target of NDGA, we were unable
to move forward with the study of this combination,
despite its robust preclinical effectiveness. These findings
highlight the value of the drug substitution paradigm in
validation of hits obtained by small molecule screens.
The third combination identified in the screen that
we chose to study further was an EGF receptor inhibitor
combined with Ro31-8220, a multi-kinase inhibitor.
Based on the published target profile for this compound,
we tested whether inhibition of p70S6 kinase was
sufficient to produce synergy in combination with EGF
receptor inhibition. Using drug substitutions and RNAi,
we demonstrated that inhibition of p70S6 kinase can
sensitize cells to treatment with an EGF receptor inhibitor,
although the synergy produced by this combination was
not as robust as when Ro31-8220 was used. This is likely
due to the effects of inhibition of other targets such as
p90RSK by Ro31-8220 that contribute to the cytotoxic
effect of the drug. Despite the differences in synergy as
assessed by growth assays, both combinations produce
robust apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry.
Understanding the mechanism of crosstalk between
two pathways whose inhibition leads to synergy is
important because it can lead to the identification of nodes
between the pathways, which may prove to be useful
drug targets themselves. We noted that treatment with
either Ro31-8220 or the p70S6 kinase inhibitor AT7867
resulted in an increase in the levels of phosphorylated
ERK. Addition of lapatinib to treatment with either
of these drugs, however, completely blocked the
compensatory ERK increase. Using the selective MEK
inhibitor PD325901, we demonstrated that blocking this
increase in ERK signaling is sufficient to cause synergy
in combination with p70S6 kinase inhibition. Therefore,
this EGF receptor-dependent ERK activation represents a
compensatory pathway providing resistance to apoptosis
upon p70S6 kinase inhibition.
The mechanism by which p70S6 kinase inhibition
results in ERK activation is unknown, but it is possible
that the effect is due to the relief of a p70S6 kinasemediated negative feedback loop. p70S6 kinase is
known to negatively regulate IRS-1 through a feedback
phosphorylation and inhibition of p70S6 kinase results
in increased IGF receptor/PI3 kinase/AKT signaling
[27]. It is possible that a similar mechanism is at play
in this context, although further studies will need to be
performed to determine whether this feedback mechanism
is occurring in this context.
While upstream feedback loops may represent
one level of crosstalk between p70S6 kinase and EGF
receptor/ERK signaling, another level exists at the point
of pathway convergence. Both ERK, through the activity
of its downstream effector p90RSK, and p70S6 kinase can
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylate and thereby deactivate the pro-apoptotic
protein BAD [20,21]. These phosphorylations lead to
the binding of and sequestration by 14-3-3 chaperone
proteins. This prevents BAD from translocating to the
mitochondrial membrane where it can effect its proapoptotic functions [28]. While treatment with either
an inhibitor of p70S6 kinase or EGF receptor had little
effect on BAD phosphorylation, combination treatment
resulted in a significant decrease in BAD phosphorylation.
These data are in agreement with our findings that the
combination treatment results in increased apoptosis. She,
et al. also identified Bad as a node of convergence between
EGFR and AKT signaling in cells lacking functional
PTEN [21]. In contrast, three out of the four cell lines
in our study that displayed sensitivity to the combination
of EGFR and p70S6K co-inhibition contained functional
PTEN. Together, these results suggest that Bad may be
a potential node regulating cell survival in multiple
genetic contexts, further increasing its potential utility as
a therapeutic target.
In this study, we have shown that a combinatorial
drug screening technique can identify pathways that
provide compensatory signaling for each other, leading
to resistance to single drug treatments. By studying the
effects of single drug treatment on the compensatory
pathway, we have identified a mechanism through which
the pro-apoptotic protein BAD remains phosphorylated
and inactivated, despite p706 kinase inhibition. This is due
to the activation of EGF receptor/ERK signaling, possibly
as a result of the relief of a negative feedback loop upon
loss of p70S6 kinase activity. Dual inhibition of these
two pathways results in decreased BAD phosphorylation
and synergistically increased apoptosis. In the context of
patient care, these results point to the need for the analysis
of individual tumors post-treatment, especially in cases
where resistance to a single targeted agent has arisen.
These analyses will likely provide information that can
be used to identify the compensatory pathways that are
leading to resistance and can allow for rationally designed
combination therapies that will improve patient outcome.
Additionally, the identification of downstream nodes, such
as BAD, may lead to new drug targets that could be as
effective, or even more effective than targeting upstream
network components.

by comparing the cytotoxicity caused by combination drug
treatment to the predicted additive cytotoxicity calculated
using the Bliss independence model [30,31].

Generation of stable KU-7 p70shRNA cells
The
doxycycline-inducible
pTRIPZ-RFPp70shRNA was purchased from Open Biosystems. This
vector was transfected into 293-T cells along with the
lentiviral packaging and envelope vectors psPAX2 and
pMDG by calcium phosphate transfection. Lentivirus was
collected two days after transfection and filter sterilized
through a 0.24 µm filter. KU-7 cells were infected with
lentivirus containing the pTRIPZ-RFP-p70shRNA or
mock transduced. Both sets of cells were then exposed
to 2.5 µg/mL puromycin until the mock-transduced plate
was completely cleared. RFP expression in the KU-7
p70shRNA cells upon 0.2 µg/mL doxycycline treatment
was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow
cytometry

Flow cytometry
Cells were plated for 24 hours in phenol-red free
RPMI-1640 and then treated as described in the text. Six
hours prior to collection, cells were pulsed with 15 µg/
mL BrdU (when applicable). Both floating and adherent
cells were collected and pooled. The cells were fixed
with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with ice-cold
methanol and stored in methanol at -20oC until use. Prior
to staining, the cells were pelleted in siliconized tubes
and washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA. A
partial DNA digestion was then performed with 2M HCl
at room temperature for 20 minutes (when applicable).
The cells were then blocked using PBS containing 2%
donkey serum, 1 % BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05%
Tween 20 for 10 minutes. Cells were then stained with the
appropriate primary antibody or antibody mixture diluted
in PBS with 1% BSA for 1 hour. From this point forward,
the cells were kept in the dark in order to preserve the
fluorescence signal. Cells were then stained with the
appropriate secondary antibody for 30 minutes and then
with 1 µg/mL DAPI in PBS. The cells were stored at 4oC
overnight and then assayed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer. Single stained controls were also assayed on
the FACSCalibur to serve as compensation controls. Data
analysis, including compensation, was performed using
Flo-Jo flow cytometry analysis software

Drug combination screening
Cells were grown to 80% confluence, then
trypsinized and made into a single cell suspension. BC
and HNC cells were resuspended in phenol red-free RPMI
1640 supplemented with 0.5% FBS. CaP cells were
resuspended in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 5% charcoal stripped serum (CSS). LNCaP, C4-2,
and RV-1 cells were divided into two separate pools. One
pool was treated with 0.1 nM R1881. Cells were plated
at densities ranging between 3000 and 7000 cells per well
in 96 well plates (depending on the rate of growth of the
individual cell line) using the BIO-MEK NX workstation.
The BIO-MEK NX workstation was used to transfer
drug solutions from the master plates with 10X drug
concentrations to the cell plates at the final concentration.
The cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37oC, 5% CO2.
After this incubation, the BIO-MEK NX workstation was
used to add alamarBlue (Invitrogen) to each plate. The
cells were incubated for another 4 hours under the same
conditions. Relative cell number was then assessed using a
fluorescence plate reader with a 540/25 nm excitation filter

Cells were plated for 24 hours in phenol-red free
RPMI 1640 + 0.5% FBS and then treated as described in
the text. Prior to cell lysis, each plate was treated with 1
µM pervanadate and 5 nM Calyculin-A for one minute.
The medium was aspirated off and the cells were washed
for 30 seconds with ice-cold PBS containing pervanadate
and Calyculin A. The PBS was removed and cells were
lysed in a Triton-based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100,
50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50mM NaF, and
5 mM EDTA) containing 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 µg/ml
leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 µM
orthovanadate, 50 mM ß-glycerophosphate, and 0.4 µM
microcystin. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of lysate was
treated overnight with total BAD antibody at 4oC. Protein
A agarose beads were then added for 4 hours of rocking
at 4oC. The beads were collected by centrifugation and
washed three times with lysis buffer containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. The immunoprecipitated
protein was then eluted from the beads by boiling in
1X LSB. Western blotting was carried out as previously
described [32]. Immunoblots were analyzed using the
Odyssey (LICOR Biosciences) imaging system.

The primary method of analysis is 2-way ANOVA
for randomized block designs, which were used to control
for experiment-to-experiment variation [33]. Contrasts
were used to make specific comparisons between groups,
and where appropriate, data were transformed to the log
scale to facilitate interpretations as fold changes. Synergy
was assessed by comparing observed values and values
