ABSTRACT
Anoikis is an anchorage-independent cell death. Resistance to anoikis is one of
the key features of metastatic cells. Here, we analyzed the role of STAT3 in anoikis
resistance in melanoma cells leading to metastasis. When grown under anchorageindependent conditions, significant proportion of cells resisted anoikis and these
resistant cells had higher rate of migration and invasion as compared to the cells
grown under anchorage-dependent conditions. The anoikis resistant cells also had
significantly higher expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 than the
cells that were attached to the basement membrane. STAT3 inhibitors, AG 490 and
piplartine (PL) induced anoikis in a concentration-dependent manner in anoikis
resistant cells. Over-expression of STAT3 or treatment with IL-6 not only increased
anoikis resistance, but also protected the cancer cells from PL-induced anoikis. On
the other hand, silencing STAT3 decreased the potential of cancer cells to resist
anoikis and to migrate. STAT3 knock-down cells and PL treated cells did not form
tumors as well as failed to metastasize in SCID-NSG mice as compared to untreated
anchorage-independent cells, which formed big tumors and extensively metastasized.
In summary, our results for the first time establish STAT3 as a critical player that
renders anoikis resistance to melanoma cells and enhance their metastatic potential.

INTRODUCTION

differentiation, survival, proliferation, chemoresistance
and angiogenesis[5-13]. Enhanced STAT3 activity has
been observed in various types of human cancers[14-18].
Janus-activated kinases (JAK), Interleukin-6 (IL-6),
epidermal growth factor receptors and Src kinases activate
STAT3 by phosphorylation at important tyrosine residues.
Phosphorylation of STAT3 causes dimerization of STAT3
followed by its nuclear translocation where it enhances the
transcription of target genes[13, 19-21]. One of the most
critical sites of phosphorylation is at Tyrosine 705 (Y705),
which enhances the expression of various proliferation
and survival genes such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Cyclin D1 and
survivin[14, 22, 23].
Melanoma is a neoplasm of melanocytes which
accounts for highest number of skin cancer related deaths.
In 2014, 76,100 new cases will be diagnosed out of which
9,710 people are expected to die (http://www.cancer.org/

Cells grow and differentiate when they are in contact
with the extracellular matrix (ECM)[1]. Cells deprived of
attachment to ECM undergo classical apoptosis known as
anoikis, meaning ‘homelessness’ in Greek[2]. Epithelial
cells highly depend on appropriate cell-cell and cell-matrix
environment for survival[3]. However, tumor cells that
acquire malignant potential develop ways to resist anoikis
and survive under anchorage-independent conditions and
acquire migratory potential[4]. Hence, tumor cells need
to evade anoikis in order to metastasize, making anoikis
resistance a key feature of metastatic cancers. Anoikis is
a new yet critical concept that is recently being the focus
of scientific attention. However, the exact mechanism of
anoikis resistance is yet not known[5].

knowledge, this is the first study establishing a direct role
of STAT3 in anoikis resistance in melanoma.

of the patient suffering from melanoma is less than 5%
and once it metastasizes, the probability of survival goes
to less than 1%. [24]. Dacarbazine, which was approved
three decades ago, still remains a drug of choice to treat
malignant melanoma although it benefits only a small
subset of patients [25]. Most common sites of metastases
for melanoma are lymph nodes, lungs, liver, bones and
brain. Melanoma cells which are resistant to anoikis
can easily metastasize [4] thus, making melanoma an
important tumor model to study anoikis resistance [26,
27].
In the current study, we have established a critical
role of STAT3 in anoikis resistance in vitro and in vivo
in melanoma. Furthermore, our study demonstrates
that induction of anoikis resistance was associated
with enhanced cell migration, invasion and metastasis

RESULTS
Melanoma cells resist anoikis in anchorage-free
conditions
Anoikis is a form of cell death that occurs when
the cells detach from the basement membrane. Studies
in the past have shown that cancer cells are able to resist
anoikis and hence, they metastasize (4). However, the
exact molecular mechanism why few cells resist anoikis
and acquire metastatic potential is not known. Using

MeWo, B16-F0, SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-5 cells were cultured under anchorage independent conditions in the plates coated with polyHEMA for 48 hours and then replated in 24-well plate. The cells were then allowed to attach after which the cell viability was evaluated
using Sulforhodamine B assay. The cell survival was compared with the cells cultured under adherent conditions for same time period.

anoikis assay, we screened five melanoma cell lines for
their potential to resist anoikis. All the five cell lines used
were malignant melanoma cell lines and were isolated
from metastatic sites. SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2, SKMEL-5, MeWo and B16-F0 cells were cultured under low
attachment (anchorage-free) conditions for 48 hours after
which their survival was evaluated by the Sulforhodamine
B (SRB) assay and compared with the cells under adherent
conditions for the same time period. Notable anoikis was
induced in all the cancer cell lines when cultured under
anchorage-free conditions (Fig. 1A). More importantly, a
significant percentage of cells survived and were termed as
anoikis resistant cells. In SK-MEL-28 and MeWo, about
65% of cells resisted anoikis and in SK-MEL-2, SKMEL-5 and B16 –F0, about 75% of cells resisted anoikis
when cultured under anchorage independent conditions
(Fig. 1A)

we performed migration and invasion assays using anoikis
resistant cells. Cells were incubated either in suspension
or adherent conditions for 48h and transferred to 24 well
plates. A wound healing assay was performed in five
melanoma cell lines. The experiment was terminated
within 16 hours after creating the wound. Our results
showed that cells that were cultured under anchorageindependent conditions and evaded anoikis, healed the
wound at much higher rate than adherent cells (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, invasion assay using Boyden’s chamber
was performed in SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2 and MeWo
cells. Our results showed that anoikis resistant cells were
highly invasive as compared to adherent cells (Fig. 1C).
SK-MEL-28 and MeWo exhibited 2 fold higher rate of
invasion and SK-MEL-2 cells showed 2.5 fold higher
rate of invasion as compared to their respective adherent
controls (Fig 1C). Hence, these results indicate that the
cells that resisted anoikis were highly migratory and
invasive.

Anoikis resistant cells are highly migratory and
invasive

STAT3 is overexpressed in anoikis resistant
melanoma cells

Recent studies have shown that it is only after the
cancer cells resist anoikis that they attain the potential to
metastasize[4]. Migration and invasion are one of the most
critical steps in metastasis as the cells in the circulation
need to migrate and invade the secondary organs. Hence,

Our results showed that anoikis resistant cells had
a very high potential to migrate and invade, as compared
to the adherent cells. The next step was to find out what

molecular changes occured in these cells making them
resistant to anoikis and transformed them into such
highly migratory and invasive phenotype. To investigate
this, we evaluated the expression of various proteins in
the anoikis resistant melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28, SKMEL-5, SK-MEL-2, MeWo and B16-F0) and compared
the results with respective adherent controls. As compared
to adherent cells, a remarkable phophorylation of STAT3
at Y705 was observed in all the five melanoma cell lines
cultured under anchorage-independent conditions and
resisted anoikis (Fig. 2A). There was also a significant upregulation of STAT3 protein expression in anoikis resistant
cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, anoikis resistant cells showed
marked increase in the expression of anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 that are under the transcriptional
regulation of STAT3 (Fig 2A). These observations were
also confirmed by immunofluorescence. As compared to
adherent cells, substantial staining of p-STAT3 (Y705),
which was indicated by red fluorescence, was observed

in SK-MEL-28 cells that were cultured under anchorageindependent conditions (Fig. 2B). Actin was indicated by
green stain. Based on these results, we hypothesized that
STAT3 plays a critical role in imparting anoikis resistance
to cancer cells and promotes their migration and invasion
potential leading to metastasis

AG 490 and Piplartine suppress resistance to
anokis in cancer cells
To test our hypothesis that STAT3 plays a role in
anoikis resistance, we wanted to determine whether STAT3
inhibitors can overcome aniokis resistance in cancer cells.
For this purpose, we used a known synthetic STAT3
inhibitor AG 490. Five melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-28,
SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5, MeWo and B16-F0) were
treated with 50µM or 100µM AG 490 under anchorage
independent conditions for 48 hours, after which the cells

by Sulforhodamine B assay. Representative bar graphs show the percentage anoikis resistance in different treatment conditions. Values

were re-cultured on an adherent plate where only the
anoikis resistant cells attached and survived. The survival
of the treated cells was evaluated using the SRB assay and
compared with the untreated anoikis resistant cells. Our
results demonstrated that AG 490 was able to substantially
reduce anoikis resistance in all the melanoma cell lines
(Fig. 3A). Anoikis resistance by treatment with 50-100μM
AG 490 was reduced by 20-60% in SK-MEL-28 cells
(Fig. 3A). Similar concentrations of AG 490 reduced
anoikis resistance by 45-65% in SK-MEL-2, 25-50% in
SK-MEL-5, 30-65% in MeWo and 70-75% in B16-F0
cells (Fig. 3A).
We also evaluated the effects of piplartine (PL), a
component of black pepper, on anoikis resistance of cancer
cells as PL was found to suppress the growth of various
cancer cell lines in our previous unpublished observations.

Our current results showed that PL (5-10 µM) after 48
h treatment caused a significant concentration-dependent
reduction of anoikis resistance in all the melanoma cells
(Fig. 3B). PL at 10 µM reduced the anoikis resistance by
90 % in most of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3B).

PL reverses anoikis resistance by inhibiting
STAT3
Since PL was superior to AG 490 in suppressing
anoikis resistance in all the cancer cell lines tested, we
wanted to identify the mechanism of anoikis induction
by PL. Five melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-28, SKMEL-2, SK-MEL-5, MeWo and B16-F0) were cultured
under anchorage- independent conditions, treated

with various concentrations of PL for 48 hours and
analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that
PL treatment significantly decreased the phophorylation
of STAT3 at Y705 in a concentration-dependent manner
in all the melanoma cell lines (Fig. 3C). At the highest
concentration, PL suppressed almost 90% phophorylation
of STAT3 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, PL also down-regulated
the protein levels of STAT3 in all the cell lines tested (Fig.
3C). Marked down-regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, the
anti-apoptotic proteins, which are under transcriptional
regulation of STAT3, were also observed by PL treatment
(Fig. 3C). Massive cleavage of PARP indicated induction
of anoikis by PL treatment (Fig. 3C). These results clearly
indicated that STAT3 inhibitors significantly reduce
anoikis resistance in melanoma cells.

reduction in the wound healing process as compared to
STAT3 (WT) cells (Fig. 4D). In fact, STAT3 knock-down
cells completely failed to heal the wound by 16 hours
as compared to STAT3 wild type anoikis resistant cells
(Fig. 4D). Hence, knocking out STAT3 not only decreased
anoikis resistance but also inhibited the migratory
potential of anoikis resistant cancer cells (Fig. 4D). Taken
together, these results establish the role of STAT3 in
anoikis resistance and migration in melanoma cells.

IL-6 enhances anoikis resistance in cancer cells
and blocks PL-induced anoikis
To further strengthen the role of STAT3 in anoikis
resistance, IL-6 was used to activate STAT3. IL-6 is well
known to activate STAT3 by phosphorylation at Y705[28].
As we had hypothesized that phosphorylation at of STAT3
Y705 conferred anoikis resistance to melanoma cells, IL-6
treatment would enhance anoikis resistance in these cells.
Moreover, since our results indicated that PL induced
anoikis by inhibition of p-STAT3 (Y705), we hypothesized
that IL-6 treatment would block PL-induced anoikis. To
test the effect of IL-6, melanoma cells were pre-treated
with IL-6 and then treated with PL under anchorageindependent conditions for 48 hours. As shown in Fig. 5A,
IL-6 treatment significantly increased anoikis resistance
in all the melanoma cell lines as compared to untreated
controls. IL-6 treatment increased the anoikis resistance
by 1.5 fold in SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-2, by 1.4 fold
in MeWo cells and by 1.3 fold in SK-MEL-5 and B16-F0
cells (Fig. 5A). As expected, IL-6 also provided marked
protection to PL treated cells (Fig. 5A). IL-6 treatment
significantly blocked the reduction in anoikis resistance
mediated by PL treatment in all five cell lines (Fig. 5A).
For example, in SK-MEL-28 cells, PL reduced anoikis
resistance by 65% (Fig. 5A). However, IL-6 treatment
blocked PL mediated anoikis by almost 45% (Fig. 5A).
Similarly, significant reduction in anoikis resistance by PL
treatment in SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5, MeWo and B16-F0
cells was blocked by IL-6 treatment, confirming our
hypothesis (Fig. 5A).
To further support these observations, our
western blot results showed a massive increase in the
phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 upon IL-6 treatment
(Fig. 5B). Our results also revealed that reduction of
p-STAT3 (Y705) by PL treatment was significantly
blocked by IL-6 (Fig. 5B). IL-6 also blocked PL-mediated
inhibition of the expression of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5B). Our results
also showed that IL-6 treatment decreased the cleavage
of PARP that was induced by PL treatment in all the cell
lines (Fig. 5B). These results validated the role of STAT3
in rendering anoikis resistance to melanoma cells.

Silencing STAT3 using shRNA blocks anoikis
resistance in cancer cells
To further test our hypothesis and to confirm the
role of STAT3 in anoikis resistance, we silenced STAT3
using shRNA in four human melanoma cells lines (SKMEL-28, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5 and MeWo). About 8090% silencing of STAT3 was achieved using shRNA in all
the four cell lines (Fig. 4A). Anoikis assay was performed
in these STAT3 silenced cells using the wild type cells
transfected with scrambled shRNA as controls. Our results
demonstrated that silencing of STAT3 highly sensitized
the cells to anoikis (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of STAT3 caused
about 80-90% decrease in anoikis resistance in all of the
cell lines (Fig. 4B), which highly correlated with STAT3
silencing. The percentage of STAT3 silencing was similar
in all the cell lines and so was the reduction in anoikis
resistance (Fig. 4A-B). These results confirmed the role of
STAT3 in providing anoikis resistance to melanoma cells.

STAT3 knock-down cells are more sensitive to
anoikis and lose migratory potential
STAT3 knock-down cell lines were used to further
confirm the role of STAT3 in anoikis. We developed
stable STAT3 knock-down (KO) melanoma cells for this
purpose. We stably silenced STAT3 in SK-MEL-28, SKMEL2, SK-MEL-5 and MeWo cells. Both STAT3 (WT)
and STAT3 knock-down (KO) cells were grown under
similar anchorage-independent conditions for 48 hours
following which anoikis resistance was determined in
these cells. As expected, anoikis resistance was decreased
by 60-75% in STAT3 knock-down as compared to the
wild type counterparts in all four cell lines tested (Fig.
4C). Since our results showed that anoikis resistance
was associated with enhanced migratory potential, we
performed a wound-healing assay in three STAT3 knockdown and respective STAT3 (WT) melanoma cells. We
observed that STAT3 knock-down cells had marked

cells over-expressing STAT3 (Fig. 5D). The increase in
anoikis resistance due to STAT3 over-expression was
1.3 fold in SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-2 cells, 1.5 fold in
SK-MEL-5 cells and 2 fold in MeWo cells (Fig. 5D). The
increase in anoikis resistance highly correlated with the
level of STAT3 overexpression. For example maximum
overexpression was achieved in MeWo cells which in turn
had the highest increase in anoikis resistance (Fig. 5CD). Because our results showed that PL treatment reduced
anoikis resistance by inhibiting STAT3, we wanted to
see if STAT3 over-expression could block the effects of
PL. Our results revealed that PL mediated anoikis was

Since our results indicated the involvement of
STAT3 in anoikis resistance, we finally wanted to
see if STAT3 over-expression could enhance anoikis
resistance. We over-expressed STAT3 by transfecting
STAT3 expressing plasmid in four melanoma cell lines
(SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL5 and MeWo)
and performed anoikis assay. We were able to achieve
1.6-2.6 fold increased expression of STAT3 (Fig. 5C).

(Fig. 5D). For example, in SK-MEL-28 cells, PL reduced
anoikis resistance by 65% (Fig. 5D). Upon STAT3
overexpression, the induction of anoikis was completely
nullyfied (Fig. 5D). Similarly, STAT3 overexpression
significantly abrogated PL-induced anoikis in SK-MEL-2,

taken. About 5 x 106 live anchorage-independent cells
were injected subcutaneously in both the flanks of SCIDNSG mice to determine the tumor formation ability. Mice
in group 1 were implanted with SK-MEL-28 wild type

three mice received SK-MEL-28 anoikis resistant cells

were formed, tumor measurements were taken twice a

DISCUSSION

STAT3 KO group was 9 ± 2.9 mm3 and that in mice from
PL treated group was 6 ± 2 mm3 (Fig. 6A). Seven mice in
KO group and 5 mice in PL group were completely free
of tumors (Fig. 6A). These results indicated that cells with
reduced or no expression of STAT3 were highly sensitive
to anoikis and, therefore, failed to grow as tumors. On the
other hand, wild type cells where STAT3 was activated
during anchorage-independent conditions had very high
tumorigenic potential. Fig. 6A also shows the images of
tumor bearing mice from the three groups. As compared
to control mice, STAT3 KO mice had no palpable tumors
whereas PL treated mice showed very small size tumors
which failed to grow over the duration of the experiment
(Fig. 6A).

In the current study, we established the role of
STAT3 in anoikis resistance and metastasis in melanoma
in vitro and in vivo. The key findings of this study are that
STAT3 plays a very important role in anoikis resistance
and inhibiting STAT3 induces anoikis in cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, induction of anoikis
resistance by STAT3 was also associated with enhanced
cell migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and
high metastatic potential in vivo.
Our results showed that all the melanoma cell
lines were highly resistant to anoikis and only a small
percentage of cells were sensitive to anoikis. Based on the
fact that the cancer cells that resist anoikis will eventually
metastasize, it is very likely that these cells would also
have very high potential to migrate and invade, to facilitate
their seeding and invading to distant organs. In a wound
healing assay and Boyden’s chamber assay our data
suggests enhanced migratory potential and invasiveness
of anoikis resistant cells as compared to adherent cells in
various cell lines tested.
STAT3 is involved in diverse functions including
cell growth, survival, differentiation, inflammation,
immune system and apoptosis. There have been few
reports showing the role of STAT3 in anoikis in squamous
cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [36-38].
However, none of these studies demonstated any in vivo
evidence indicating the role of STAT3 in anoikis resistance
or metastasis. Nonetheless, the role of STAT3 in anoikis
and metastasis in melanoma has not been established yet.
As compared to adherent cells, anoikis resistant melanoma
cells exhibited significantly increased expression
and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705. Our results
demonstrated increased expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
in anoikis resistant cells associating STAT3 with anoikis
resistance. Based on these results, we hypothesized that
activation and over-expression of STAT3 induces anoikis
resistance in cancer cells and promotes metastasis.
Our results demonstrated almost 70-80% reduction
in anoikis resistance upon transient silencing of STAT3.
Interestingly, anoikis induction in these cells highly
correlated with the extent of STAT3 knockdown.
The extent of knockdown was comparable in all the
melanoma cell lines and consequently the reduction in
anoikis resistance was also similar indicating that all the
metastatic melanoma cell lines were equally dependent
on STAT3 for anoikis resistance. These results were also
confirmed in STAT3 knock-down melanoma cell lines.
The role of STAT3 in anoikis resistance has also been
confirmed in pancreatic cancer (unpublished data). STAT3
knock-down cells not only had lower resistance to anoikis,
but also exhibited a lower rate of migration as compared
to their respective wild type anchorage-independent
cells. On the other hand, IL-6 and over-expression of
STAT3 in SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5 and

STAT3 enhances metastatic potential in cancer
cells by rendering anoikis resistance
Anoikis resistance is one of the hallmarks of a
metastatic cancer cell. As a proof-of-principle, we tested
the role of STAT3 in the metastasis of melanoma in the
animal model. Anchorage-independent SK-MEL-28
wild type (Control), SK-MEL-28 STAT3 knockout
(STAT3 KO) or PL treated SK-MEL-28 cells were
injected intravenously in mice after which their ability
to metastasize was determined. The weight of the mice
injected with SK-MEL-28 STAT3 knockout or PL treated
SK-MEL-28 cells increased normally over the period
of time (Fig. 6B). However, a significant reduction in
the weight of the mice injected with SK-MEL-28 wild
type cells was observed (Fig. 6B). The weight reduction
of mice in this group indicated illness due to the heavy
metastatic burden. This is the time when the animals were
sacrificed and the extent of metastasis was examined. Our
results showed that mice injected with anoikis resistant
SK-MEL-28 wild type cells had an extensive metastatic
burden. The cells mainly metastasized to lungs and
liver (Fig. 6C). Lungs and livers of mice from anoikis
resistant wild type group showed massive metastatic
nodules. Being melanotic, SK-MEL-28 cells appeared
as pigmented nodules (Fig. 6C) [29-35]. Surprisingly, no
observable nodules were found in the lungs and livers
of the mice injected with STAT3 knockout (STAT3 KO)
or PL treated cells, which supposedly had diminished
expression of STAT3 (Fig. 6C). H & E staining was
performed to confirm the presence of metastatic nodules.
The metastatic nodules in the lung sections were depicted
by the presence of large and randomly arranged nuclei, a
typical characteristic of a tumor (Fig. 6D). As expected,
no metastatic nodules were detected in the sections of the
lungs of STAT3 knockout or PL treated groups (Fig. 6D).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that STAT3
plays a very important role in metastasis of melanoma
tumors in vivo.

MeWo cells not only decreased sensitivity to anoikis but
also completely protected from PL-induced anoikis. A
significant population of cells that was sensitive to anoikis
became resistant upon enhancing the expression of STAT3
or its phosphorylation at Y705. Induction of anoikis by
PL mediated inhibition of STAT3 has not been reported.
Our results showed that PL was more potent than AG
490 in inducing anoikis. Although AG 490 is a STAT3
inhibitor, there have been several reports indicating its offtarget effects, for e.g. AG 490 has been shown to inhibit
EGFR as well as HER-2[39]. In addition, it has also been
shown to inhibit Akt[40]. This could be a reason for its
decreased potency. Abrogation of PL-induced anoikis by
STAT3 overexpression or IL-6 treatment confirmed the
role of STAT3 in PL induced anoikis. Taken together, these
results clearly showed that STAT3 plays a critical role in
conferring anoikis resistance and promoting cell migration
in cancer cells. The cells lines used for this study had
differences in their genetic profile. For instance, SKMEL-28 and SK-MEL-5 had mutant BRAFV600E whereas
the other cell lines used had wild-type BRAF. SK-MEL-2
and SK-MEL-5 had mutant N-RAS whereas all the others
had wild type NRAS. SK-MEL-28 and MeWo harbored
mutant p53, whereas the other cells lines had wild type
p53[41, 42]. In spite of these genetic variations in these
cell lines, all of these cell lines demonstrated similar
dependence on STAT3 for anoikis resistance.
Importantly, SK-MEL-28 exposed to PL under
anchorage-independent conditions completely failed to
grow as tumors when injected subcutaneously in SCID/
NSG mice. Similarly, STAT3 knock-down SK-MEL-28
cells cultured under anchorage-independent conditions
also failed to form tumors in vivo. On the contrary,
wild type untreated SK-MEL-28 cells cultured under
anchorage-independent condition formed aggressive
tumors in SCID/NSG mice. Failure to form tumors by PL
treatment or STAT3 knock-down cells can be attributed to
the diminished expression of STAT3, which consequently
led to increase sensitivity to anoikis.
It is noteworthy that PL treated and STAT3
knock-down anchorage-independent SK-MEL-28 cells
completely failed to metastasize to lungs and liver when
injected intravenously in SCID-NSG mice. However,
SK-MEL-28 wild type cells cultured under similar
conditions extensively metastasized to lungs and liver
upon intravenous injection. These observations once again
show that the cancer cells with differential expression
of STAT3 respond differently to anoikis resistance and
metastasis. Our study also supports the accumulating
clinical and pathological evidence on the role of STAT3 in
the aggressiveness of various cancers[14, 15]. Moreover,
the role of STAT3 in anoikis resistance and metastasis in
vivo has not been established yet.
In conclusion, we report a novel characteristic of
STAT3 in promoting resistance to anoikis in melanoma.
These results strongly establish overexpression of STAT3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as a critical mechanism to evade anoikis in melanoma and
promote metastasis. Therefore, STAT3 inhibitors can be
used as a rational therapeutic strategy to prevent or inhibit
metastasis in melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Piplartine (PL) was obtained from Cayman
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). AG 490 was acquired
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). G418, Mayer’s
Hematoxylin, Eosin and Permount were obtained from
Fisher Scientific (Houston, TX). All the antibodies
were bought from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) unless
specified. Poly(2-hydroxyethyl) methacrylate (polyHEMA), Sulforhodamine (SRB) and antibody against
actin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). RPMI and McCoy 5A were purchased from
Mediatech (Manassas, VA). DMEM and EMEM were
procured from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Transfection
reagent Lipofectamine 2000 was obtained from Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Recombinant IL-6
was purchased from Peprotech (Rockyhill, NJ). STAT3
shRNA was obtained from SA Biosciences (Frederick,
MD) and STAT3α plasmid was a generous gift from Dr.
J.F. Bloomberg (Rockefeller University, NY).

Cell Culture
Human melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28, MeWo,
and murine melanoma cell line B16-F0 were obtained
from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured as previously
described [43]. Human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2
was a kind gift from Dr. Srikumar Chellappan (H. Lee
Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa,
FL) and SK-MEL-5 was a gift from Dr. Randy Burd
(University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ). All the melanoma
cell lines were cultured in EMEM medium (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, neomycin). All
the cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat
(STR) analysis at Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center (TTUHSC) core facilities (Lubbock, TX).

Anoikis assay
In order to simulate anchorage-independent growth
conditions, we coated culture dishes with Poly-HEMA
as described earlier[44]. Anoikis assay was performed
according to the previously described protocol by us[44].
Approximately 1X106 cells were plated in poly-HEMA
coated petri dishes. These cells were either untreated or
7060

Oncotarget

treated with various concentrations of piplartine (PL) or
AG 490. After the desired treatment time was achieved,
cells were centrifuged and uniformly divided in a 24well plate. As previously described, after 8 hours, cells
were processed for SRB assay[45]. Anoikis resistance of
control was considered as 100% and various treatments
were calculated as percentage of control. The graph was
then plotted as percent of anoikis resistance on the y-axis
and various treatment concentrations on x-axis.

shRNA, shRNA (STAT3 knock-down) or plasmid
overexpressing STAT3 (STAT3 +/+). Complexes were
prepared by incubating 2µg DNA with 6 µl Lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent in 200 µl OPTI-MEM media
without serum or antibiotic for 20 minutes. These
complexes were then added to the cells. Six hours after
transfection, complexes were replaced with fresh medium.
After 24 hours of transfection, cells were processed for
anoikis assay or western blotting as described above.

Migration and Invasion Assay

Induction of STAT3 by IL-6

Wound Healing and invasion assays were performed
to compare the migratory potential and invasiveness of
anoikis resistant cells and compared with the adherent
cells. This assay was performed according to the
previously described method by us[46-48]. Cells were
incubated in either anchorage dependent or independent
conditions for 48. For wound healing assay, cells were
transferred to a 24-well plate. Eight hours after the
formation of the monolayer, a wound was made across
it by scratching with 1mL sterile pipette tip. Cells were
washed to remove displaced and floating cells and allowed
to migrate until one of the groups healed the wound
completely (usually 16 hours), followed by staining with
SRB. The cells were imaged under microscope. (Olympus
America, Inc, Center Valley, PA)
For invasion assay, after 48 hours incubation of
cells under adherent or anchorage independent conditions,
cells were transferred to the upper chamber of Boyden’s
chamber (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and were
serum starved for 24 hours after which VEGF (10 ng/mL)
was added to the lower chamber as a chemo attractant.
After 48 hours, cells in the upper chamber were wiped
off with a cotton swab and the filter was removed and
transferred to a 96-well plate and processed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Activation of STAT3 (Y705) was performed
as explained previously by us [28, 48]. Anchorageindependent cells were treated with 10ng/mL IL-6. One
hour after IL-6 treatment, one group of cells was treated
with 5µM PL for 48 hours. Following the treatment,
cells were either processed for anoikis assay or western
blotting.

Generation of stable STAT3 knockout cell lines
STAT3 was knocked down stably in SK-MEL-28,
SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5 and MeWo cells using STAT3
shRNA according to previously described method by us
[48]. Colonies were selected using G418 as the selection
marker. Selected colonies were then maintained with 2mg/
mL of G418 till 8 passages. The transfected cells were
then used for anoikis experiment, cell migration assay or
in vivo experiments.

Immunofluorescence
SK-MEL-28 cells were incubated with or without
anchorage for 48h. Adherent and suspension cells were
immunostained with anti-p-STAT3 (Y705) antibody as
described previously by us [50].

Western Blotting

In vivo anoikis xenograft experiment

Cells were incubated in either anchorage dependent
or independent conditions for 48h. In another experiment,
cancer cells were exposed to various concentrations of PL
for 48h. Following these incubations, cells were collected,
lysed and approximately 30-80 μg of protein was separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis
followed by immunoblotting as described previously[49].

In vivo xenograft experiments were performed
as described previously, with slight modifications[44].
Male SCID/NSG mice (5-7 weeks old) were obtained
from TTUHSC Breeding Facility (Lubbock, TX) and
maintained under special pathogen free conditions. The
use of SCID/NSG mice was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC) and the
experiments were performed in strict compliance with
the regulations. SK-MEL-28 cells were treated with
5 μM STAT3 inhibitor (PL) for 48h under anchorageindependent conditions. On the other hand, SK-MEL-28
STAT3 knock-down cells without treatment were
incubated under anchorage-independent conditions for
48h. Viable cells were counted by trypan blue assay

STAT3 transient transfection
STAT3 was either over-expressed using a plasmid
or knocked down using shRNA as described previously
by us [28]. Briefly, 0.3 x 106 cells were plated in OPTIMEM without antibiotics and transfected with scrambled

and 5X106 cells resuspended in 1:1 Dulbecco Phosphate
Buffered Saline (DPBS):Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Houston, TX) were injected subcutaneously in both
flanks of the mice (3 groups; n=9 mice per group). Tumor
volume was measured using vernier calipers twice a week
and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula
described by us previously[51, 52].

In vivo anoikis metastasis experiment

REFERENCES

Male SCID/NSG mice (5-7 week old) were used
for this experiment. SK-MEL-28 wild type cells were
treated with STAT3 inhibitor (PL) under anchorageindependent conditions for 48 h whereas SK-MEL-28
STAT3 knock-down cells were incubated in anchorageindependent conditions for 48h without any treatment.
Untreated SK-MEL-28 cells incubated under anchorageindependent conditions were used as control. Viable cells
were counted by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. About
0.2X106 viable cells re-suspended in PBS were injected
intravenously through the lateral tail vein (3 groups; n=10
mice per group). The experiment was continued till the
mice became ill due to metastatic burden after which they
were sacrificed, and lungs and liver were extracted for the
analysis of metastatic tumor nodules by histopathology.
