ABSTRACT
Purpose: This study was performed to compare the efficacies and toxicities of
cisplatin (CDDP)- and carboplatin (CBDCA)-based chemotherapy (CT) in patients with
SCCHN.
Methods: The search strategy included Pubmed, Science Direct, the Cochrane
Library, and the China National Knowledge Internet Web. Statistical analyses were
performed using RevMan 5.2. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) with
secondary endpoints of locoregional control (LRC) and grade≥3 toxicity.
Results: Overall, 12 studies and 1165 patients were included. CDDP-based CT
significantly improved 5-year OS (HR=0.67, 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91; P=0.01) compared
to the CBDCA group. No difference in the 3-year OS/LRC was observed, but a
subgroup analysis showed a better 3-year OS in the CDDP arm for non-nasopharynx
carcinoma (non-NPC) SCCHN (HR=0.66, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P=0.01). The CDDPbased CT was associated with more gastrointestinal toxicities (RR=4.58; P=0.005)
and nephrotoxicity (4/110=3.6%) compared to the CBDCA group, but fewer anemia,
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia with RRs of 0.27, 0.71, and 0.28 respectively.
Conclusions: Patients with CDDP-based CT can achieve a higher OS, but there
is no significant difference in LRC. The CDDP-based CT is associated with fewer
hematological toxicities but more gastrointestinal toxicities and nephrotoxicity
compared to the CBDCA arm.

0.76 [0.70; 0.82], P<0.0001), loco-regional control (HR
0.74 [0.65; 0.85], P<0.0001), distant control (0.68 [0.60;
0.76], P<0.0001) and NPC related mortality (0.73 [0.66;
0.81], P<0.0001). There was a significant interaction
between treatment effect on OS and the timing of CT
(P=0.01) in favor of concomitant CT (without adjuvant
CT: HR 0.80 [0.70; 0.93]; with adjuvant CT: HR 0.65
[0.56; 0.76]) compared to induction CT alone (HR 0.96
[0.80; 1.16]) or adjuvant CT alone (HR 0.87 [0.68; 1.12])
[4]. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) Guidelines of head and neck cancers,
Version 2.2014, adjuvant chemotherapy and induction
chemotherapy are revised in the recommendation for
category 2A and 3, respectively, while concurrent
chemoradiotherapy is now a category 1 recommendation
for suggested standard therapy.

INTRODUCTION
More than 500,000 people worldwide are diagnosed
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(SCCHN) each year [1, 2]. Several treatment approaches
exist for SCCHN, such as radiotherapy, concomitant
chemoradiation (CRT), neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and adjuvant chemotherapy. In the (MACH-NC) metaanalysis update published in 2011, results from 87
randomized clinical trials with 16,192 patients revealed
a clear benefit with the use of chemotherapy in all tumor
locations of SCCHN, with a hazard ratio (HR) between
0.87 and 0.88 [3]. The (MAC-NPC) meta-analysis was
updated in 2014 and included 19 trials and 4798 patients,
which showed that the benefit of the addition of CT was
consistent for all endpoints: progression-free survival (HR

The platinum-based (mainly cisplatin and
carboplatin) concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens
are recommended by the NCCN Guidelines of head
and neck cancers, Version 2.2014, and cisplatin has
priority over the other platinum-based drugs. The
benefit of combining cisplatin with radiation therapy
has been confirmed in multiple randomized clinical
trials [5, 6, 7]. However, significant cisplatin-induced
toxicities include myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting,
nephrotoxicity [8], mucositis, dermatitis, and potentially
permanent ototoxicity. In this setting, there is currently
uncertainty regarding the best choice of concomitant
agent.
Carboplatin, a second generation platinum-based
drug, has been frequently used to replace cisplatin
because of its similar mode of action, but lower rates
of ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and emesis
[9]. A randomized controlled trial compared concurrent
chemotherapy with carboplatin versus standard
concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin in 206
patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal
caner (NPC). There was no significant difference
between the two groups in terms of 3-year overall
survival (cisplatin 77.7%, carboplatin 79.2%, HR=0.83,
P=0.9884) and 3-year disease-free survival (cisplatin
63.4%, carboplatin 60.9%, HR=0.70, P=0.9613). The
tolerability of the carboplatin-based regimen was better
than that of the cisplatin-based regimen [10]. Currently,
there have also been several other studies comparing
the cisplatin-based regimen with the carboplatinbased regimen [11–21], but none of these studies were
sufficiently large to demonstrate a statistically significant
effect.
Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of the
published clinical trials, retrospective studies and
matched-pair analysis comparing the cisplatin-based
regimen with the carboplatin-based regimen in SCCHN.
Both treatment groups were compared for overall
survival (OS) and locoregional control (LRC), as well
as for toxicities.

studies. Details of the selected studies are provided in
Table 1.

Overall survival
Six studies [10–14, 20] reported the data of 3-year
OS, which included 369 patients in the cisplatin group
and 361 patients in the carboplatin group. The 3-year
OS for the cisplatin group was statistically similar to
that of the carboplatin group (HR=0.77, 95%CI, 0.58
to 1.03; P=0.08) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the total
dose of cisplatin in one trial [12] (112 mg/m2) was
much lower than those used in other studies reported
in the literature, and in the subgroup analysis of nonNPC SCCHN, the heterogeneity was raised to a critical
value (I2=49%, P=0.10) if this trial was included.
After the exclusion of this trial, the cisplatin-based
chemotherapy improved 3-year OS compared with the
carboplatin-based chemotherapy, with an HR of death
of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P=0.01) (Figure 2B).
All of the included studies were treated with concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), except one trial [14], which
used neoadjuvant CT+RT. Without this trial, the 3-year
OS was not significantly different between the two
groups (HR=0.73, 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.05; P=0.09). There
was no heterogeneity between studies for the 3-year OS
analyses.
Four eligible studies [11–14] had data for 5-year
OS, including 238 patients in the cisplatin group and
212 patients in the carboplatin group. The HR of 5-year
OS was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.92; P=0.01) (Figure
2C), which showed a significant difference in favor of
the cisplatin group. All of the four included studies were
performed in non-NPC SCCHN patients. Among the
four included studies, only one study [14] treated with
neoadjuvant CT+RT, and the other studies treated with
concurrent RCT. In the subgroup analysis of 5-year OS for
CCRT-treated patients, we removed only one study [12]
due to the heterogeneity, which was related to its lower
dose of cisplatin (I2=59%, P=0.09), and with an HR of
0.54 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85; P=0.008), it also showed a
significantly higher rate of 5-year OS in favor of cisplatin.
There was no heterogeneity between studies for the 5-year
OS analyses.

RESULTS
Selection of studies
A total of 694 studies were retrieved using the
search strategies, and 12 studies published between 1995
and 2013 were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).
All of the studies included both regimens. Overall, 1165
patients from the selected studies were included in this
analysis. The number of patients treated with cisplatin and
carboplatin was 593 and 572, respectively. The median
age ranged between 46-77 and 50-73 for the cisplatin and
carboplatin groups, respectively. Not all of the outcome
data were reported or extractable from all of the included

Locoregional control
Four studies [11–13, 20] were included in the 3-year
LRC analysis, including 210 patients in the cisplatin
group and 205 patients in the carboplatin group. There
was no significant difference between the two arms for
the 3-year LRC (HR=1.16, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.67; P=0.43)
(Figure 2D). No heterogeneity was observed. The CCRT
was planned in these four studies, which were all designed
for non-NPC SCCHN patients.

CRT only. Most of the participants in the three studies [10,
15, 16] were diagnosed with NPC, and the risk ratio of
grade≥3 nausea and vomiting in NPC was 2.76 (95% CI,
0.29 to 25.96; P=0.38; heterogeneity P=0.94, I2=0%). In
the other three studies, which excluded NPC patients, the
incidence of grade≥3 nausea and vomiting was found to be
lower in the carboplatin group (RR=5.21; 95% CI, 1.53 to
17.79; P=0.008; heterogeneity P=0.25, I2=28%).

Grade≥3 nausea and vomiting
Seven eligible studies [10–12, 14–16, 18] had the
data for grade≥3 nausea and vomiting, which included
369 patients in the cisplatin group and 367 patients in
the carboplatin group. There was a significant difference
in favor of the carboplatin group (RR=4.58, 95% CI,
1.57 to 13.37; P=0.005) (Figure 3). All of the included
studies were treated with concurrent CRT, except two
studies [14, 16], which were treated with neoadjuvant
CT+RT. After rejecting these two studies, the carboplatin
group was also associated with a lower rate of grade≥3
nausea and vomiting, with an RR of 2.34 (95% CI, 0.62 to
8.91; P=0.21), but the difference did not reach statistical
significance. There was also no heterogeneity between
studies for grade≥3 nausea and vomiting, independent of
whether the included studies were treated with concurrent

Grade≥3 mucositis
Eight eligible studies [10–12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21]
had the data for grade≥3 mucositis, which included 447
patients in the cisplatin group and 468 patients in the
carboplatin group. No difference in grade≥3 mucositis
was observed (RR=1.01; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.94; P=0.97).
A between trial heterogeneity was observed for grade≥3
mucositis with an I2=75% (P=0.0004) (Figure 4). For the
six studies treated with concurrent CRT [10–12, 15, 20,

21], there was also a nonsignificant difference between
the two groups (RR=0.84, 95%CI, 0.43 to 1.62; P=0.60),
while significant heterogeneity existed among studies
(I2=75%, P=0.001). There was no significant difference
between the two groups for NPC patients [10, 15, 18, 21]]
(RR=0.43; 95% CI, 0.09 to 2.03; P=0.28), but there was
significant heterogeneity with an I2=89%. According to
the results of the sensitivity analysis, one trial [21] was
excluded, and there was a significant difference in favor
of the cisplatin group (RR=0.20; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.45;
P<0.0001). For the non-NPC patients [11, 12, 14, 20]], the
rate of grade≥3 mucositis was not found to be significantly
different between the two groups (RR=1.99; 95% CI, 0.73
to 5.41; P=0.18), but the heterogeneity was also significant
with an I2=63% (P=0.04). According to the results of the
sensitivity analysis, one trial [11] was excluded, and the
carboplatin group was associated with a lower rate of
grade≥3 mucositis, with an RR of 3.55 (95% CI, 1.42 to
8.88; P=0.007).

There was no significant difference in grade≥3 skin toxicity
between the two groups (RR=1.06; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.51;
P=0.75; heterogeneity P=0.31, I2=16%). The five studies
were all treated with CCRT. Most participants in the three
studies [10, 15, 21] had NPC, and there was no significant
difference in grade≥3 skin toxicity between the two groups
in NPC (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.50; P=0.98). No
heterogeneity was observed. The other two studies [11,
12] excluded patients with NPC and showed no difference
in grade≥3 skin toxicity for non-NPC SCCHN (RR=1.47;
95% CI, 0.34 to 6.29; P=0.60), and there was significant
heterogeneity with an I2 equivalent to 65%.
Grade≥3 anemia
Six eligible studies [10, 11, 14, 18, 20] reported
the data for grade≥3 anemia, which included 300
patients in the cisplatin group and 320 patients in
the carboplatin group. The RR was 0.48 (95% CI,
0.11 to 2.11; P=0.33), showing a nonsignificant
difference of grade≥3 anemia between the two
groups. However, significant heterogeneity existed
among trials (P=0.006, I2=70%). This heterogeneity
was correlated to one study [10] due to the higher
proportion of female participants than the other

Grade≥3 skin toxicity
Five eligible studies [10–12, 15, 21] reported the
data for grade≥3 skin toxicity, which included 360 patients
in the cisplatin group and 359 in the carboplatin group.

a significant difference in grade≥3 anemia in favor of
the cisplatin group (RR=0.27; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.63;
P=0.002; heterogeneity P=0.23, I2=29%) (Figure 5A).
To analyze the grade≥3 anemia of the studies that
were treated with only concurrent CRT, two studies
[14, 18] were excluded, and there was no significant
difference between the two groups (RR=0.44; 95% CI,
0.17 to 1.17; P=0.10; heterogeneity P=0.22, I2=34%).
Only one study [15] was limited to NPC patients.
Three studies [11, 14, 20] were limited to SCCHN
excluding NPC. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was
also associated with a non-significant lower rate of
grade≥3 anemia for non-NPC SCCHN compared with
carboplatin, with an RR of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.16 to 1.07;
P=0.07). No heterogeneity was observed.

Seven eligible studies [10, 14–17, 20, 21] had data
for grade≥3 leukopenia, which included 354 patients in the
cisplatin group and 362 patients in the carboplatin group.
Cisplatin-based regimen improved grade≥3 leukopenia as
compared with a regimen based on carboplatin, with an
RR of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.96; P=0.03; heterogeneity
P=0.13, I2=39%) (Figure 5B). Three studies [14, 16,
17] were excluded because their treatment regimen was
neoadjuvant CT+RT, whereas the remaining four studies
[10, 15, 20, 21]] were treated with concurrent CRT.
Grade≥3 leukopenia was estimated to be statistically
similar between the two arms (RR=0.82; 95% CI, 0.59 to
1.13; P=0.22; heterogeneity P=0.18, I2=38%). Five studies

and thrombocytopenia) compared with carboplatin
for SCCHN. In contrast, carboplatin was associated
with a lower rate of gastrointestinal toxicities (grade≥3
nausea and vomiting) and nephrotoxicity. No significant
difference between the two arms was observed in the
3-year LRC and severe skin toxicity.
CCRT was planned in eight studies (924 patients)
[10–13, 15, 19–21]. In the SCCHN patients treated with
CCRT, cisplatin also showed a marked improvement in
the 5-year OS and rate of grade≥3 thrombocytopenia
compared with carboplatin. There was no significant
difference in the 3-year OS, 3-year LRC and other
toxicities between the carboplatin and cisplatin cohorts
for concurrent CRT-treated SCCHN.
Four studies [10, 15, 17, 21]] fulfilled the inclusion
criteria of all participants with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), and the participants of two studies [16, 18] were
mostly diagnosed with NPC (73.68% and 65.85%).
There was a remarkable difference in favor of cisplatin in
severe hematotoxicity (grade≥3 anemia, leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia) for NPC. Six studies [11–14, 19, 20]
were designed for non-NPC SCCHN patients. For non-NPC
SCCHN patients, the 3-year and 5-year OS were significantly
higher in the cisplatin arm, while carboplatin-based
chemotherapy significantly improved severe gastrointestinal
toxicity (grade≥3 nausea and vomiting). There was more
grade≥3 thrombocytopenia in the carboplatin arm.
Mucositis is one of the most serious problems
observed in patients treated for head and neck squamouscell cancer. This side effect is observed in more than
80% of RT-treated patients and can last for more than 5
weeks [22]. Mucositis causes substantial pain, bleeding,
interferes with the patient’s ability to eat, and worsens the
patient’s quality of life. In some cases, the severe mucosal
toxicity and associated discomfort can even result in
incomplete radiation doses and poor local tumor control,
which may adversely affect survival [23]. Our subgroup
analysis of mucositis appears to favor carboplatin-based
regimens in non-NPC patients, and the result is reversed
in NPC patients. After confirming the data of the four
studies [10, 15, 18, 21]] included for the analysis of
mucositis in NPC patients, we found that in one Chinese
study [15], the dosage and frequency of carboplatin were
much higher than those recommended in the instructions
for Asian people. In this study, the carboplatin group
underwent chemotherapy using carboplatin 50 mg/m2 for
d1-5, 5-FU 75-mg/m2 for d1-5, repeated every 3 weeks
for 3 cycles. According to the instructions of carboplatin
for Asian patients, regular dosages of carboplatin are
200-400 mg/m2, d1, repeated every 3-4 weeks or 50 mg/
m2, d1-5, repeated every 4 weeks. The severe toxicities
and poor ability to receive all of the carboplatin courses

Grade≥3 thrombocytopenia
Seven eligible studies [10, 11, 14–16, 18, 20]
reported the data of grade≥3 thrombocytopenia, which
included 331 patients in the cisplatin group and 346 in the
carboplatin group. There was a significant difference in
grade≥3 thrombocytopenia in favor of the cisplatin group
(RR=0.28; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.54; P=0.0001) (Figure 5C).
Among the seven included studies, two [14, 16] were
treated with neoadjuvant CT+RT, one [18] was treated
with palliative CT, and the rest of the studies were treated
with concurrent CRT. Three non-concurrent CRT studies
were excluded [14, 16, 18], and the risk ratio of grade≥3
thrombocytopenia was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.92; P=0.03),
which also showed a significant reduction in the risk of
grade≥3 thrombocytopenia in favor of the cisplatin arm.
There was no heterogeneity between trials for grade≥3
thrombocytopenia analysis. Most of the participants in the
three studies [10, 15, 16] were diagnosed with NPC, and
there was also a significant difference in favor of the cisplatin
group for NPC (RR=0.34; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.92; P=0.03;
heterogeneity P=0.25, I2=29%). The other three studies [11,
14, 20] regarded NPC as an exclusion criteria, and showed a
significantly lower rate of grade≥3 thrombocytopenia in the
cisplatin group (RR=0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.65; P=0.004).
However, significant heterogeneity existed among studies
(P=0.10, I2=56%). According to the results of a sensitivity
analysis, one trial [20] was excluded, and there was a
significant difference in grade≥3 thrombocytopenia in favor
of the cisplatin group (RR=0.09; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.49;
P=0.005; heterogeneity P=0.70, I2=0%).
Overall, mucositis and leukopenia were the most
frequent disorders observed in patients in both groups.
There were 3 treatment-related deaths in the cisplatin
group and 5 in the carboplatin group of the two studies
[12, 18]. In addition to the adverse events described above,
there were also some other events reported, such as severe
ototoxicity, neurotoxicity, dysphagia, hepatotoxicity and
other symptoms. Grade≥3 nephrotoxicity only appeared
in one study [10], whereas overall, the five studies [10,
11, 15, 18, 20] had data for this toxicity. For the cisplatin
group, four patients suffered grade 3-4 nephrotoxicity.
However, no patients experienced this severe toxicity in
the carboplatin group.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this article is the
first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
cisplatin-based CT versus that based on carboplatin for
moderate to advanced SCCHN. A total of 1165 patients

may attribute to the higher dosage and frequency for
carboplatin. This may be a potential risk factor affecting
mucositis analysis, which motivates additional efforts
for the standardization of a definitive setting in large
randomized trials to indicate superiority of these two
regimens in the subgroup analysis.
Most of the studies reporting the data of 3/ 5-year OS
and 3-year LRC were of concurrent radiochemotherapy for
non-NPC SCCHN patients, and thus, we can conclude that
cisplatin appears preferable to carboplatin for the concurrent
radiochemotherapy of patients with non-NPC SCCHN
because it results in better 3 / 5-year OS. There was no
significant difference in 3-year LRC. Severe hematological
toxicities (grade≥3 anemia, thrombocytopenia and
leukopenia) were more frequent after carboplatin treatment,
particularly for NPC. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity
(grade≥3 nausea and vomiting) was more frequent in the
cisplatin group, particularly for non-NPC SCCHN patients.
A major limitation of this meta-analysis is that there
are only three randomized trials available, while others are
retrospective studies or matched-pair studies. The second
limitation is that the studies reporting the OS and LRC
were mostly performed in non-NPC SCCHN patients
using concurrent radiochemotherapy, and the data of OS
and LRC in six studies [15–19, 21] are missing. Third, the
treatment models of concurrent radiochemotherapy varied
from study to study, including chemotherapy administered
every week, every day, every 3 weeks or the first week.
This variation may affect the results of the analysis.
Finally, the data of late toxicity, such as hearing loss,
xerostomia and radiation encephalopathy are missing. We
analyzed the acute toxicities only in the present study.
In conclusion, our research indicated that compared
with the carboplatin group, cisplatin-based CT in non-NPC
SCCHN patients could improve the 3-year OS and 5-year
OS, while the 3-year LRC was not significantly different
between the two groups. Severe hematologic toxicities
(grade≥3 anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) were
more frequent in the carboplatin group, particularly for NPC
patients. There was more severe gastrointestinal toxicity
(grade≥3 nausea and vomiting) in the cisplatin group,
particularly for non-NPC SCCHN patients. Larger and
multicenter RCTs are required to assess whether the cisplatinbased regimen is superior to that based on carboplatin for
various types of moderate to advanced SCCHN. Moreover,
RCTs comparing different regimens of concurrent
radiochemotherapy, such as chemotherapy administered
every week, every day, every 3 weeks or the first week should
also be explored in moderate to advanced SCCHN.

AND cisplatin AND carboplatin. We also retrieved
“lip,” “oral cavity,” “oropharyngeal,” “hypopharyngeal,”
“nasopharyngeal,” “laryngeal,” “sinus,” and “salivary

retrospective studies and one matched-pair analysis
fulfilled the search criteria of therapy with cisplatin versus
carboplatin in a randomized clinical trial, retrospective
study or matched-pair analysis.

Data collection and analysis
The extracted data included demographics,
treatment and clinical outcomes [overall survival (OS),
loco-regional control (LRC) and toxicities]. The outcome
data extracted for each arm were analyzed using random
and fixed effect models and were reported as weighted
measures. All analyses were performed using RevMan
5.2 software (Cochrane Collaboration’s Information
Management System). The risk ratios of the adverse
effect were calculated, which were presented with the
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The results of
OS and LRC were also extracted. The significant outcome
was defined as a P-value below 0.05; a fixed-effects
model was applied when homogeneity was good (P≥0.10,
I2≤50%), or a random-effects model was used. KaplanMeier curves were evaluated using the Engauge-Digitizer.
