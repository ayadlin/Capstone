Abstract
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinological
disorders in reproductive aged women. PCOS and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are closely
linked in multiple levels and possess high pathobiological similarity. Here, we put
forward a new computational approach based on the pathobiological similarity to
identify PCOS potential drug target modules (PPDT-Modules) and PCOS potential
drug targets in the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). From the systems
level and biological background, 1 PPDT-Module and 22 PCOS potential drug targets
were identified, 21 of which were verified by literatures to be associated with the
pathogenesis of PCOS. 42 drugs targeting to 13 PCOS potential drug targets were
investigated experimentally or clinically for PCOS. Evaluated by independent datasets,
the whole PPDT-Module and 22 PCOS potential drug targets could not only reveal
the drug response, but also distinguish the statuses between normal and disease.
Our identified PPDT-Module and PCOS potential drug targets would shed light on the
treatment of PCOS. And our approach would provide valuable insights to research on
the pathogenesis and drug response of other diseases.

Introduction

that some other features including weight gain, disturbance
of hormones and lipid disorders are associated with both
PCOS and T2D [6, 7]. In the meantime, PCOS and T2D
are closely linked in the epidemiology and etiology
as well as in the systems biology [8, 9]. Significant
pathobiological similarity between PCOS and T2D was
also indicated (−0.2) after determining the pathobiological
and clinical relationship between these diseases using a
method proposed by Jörg Menche et al. [9].
Metformin is the only known drug for PCOS
in Drugbank. The DrugBank database is a unique
bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that
combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug
target information, which was widely recognized and
used [10]. As an insulin sensitizer, Metformin can cause
reductions in body weight, restore ovulation, increase the
rate of pregnancy and reduce the number of pregnancy

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the
most common endocrinological disorders in reproductive
aged women, of which the prevalence is 5–10% in the
general population [1–3]. The clinical and biochemical
characteristics of PCOS are generally grouped into two
main categories: (i) reproductive features that mainly
include chronic anovulation, and (ii) hyperandrogenic
features that mainly include hyperandrogenaemia.
As important metabolism characteristics, insulin
resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are
observed in approximately 70% of PCOS women [4],
which contribute to the strong association of PCOS
with adverse metabolic risk, including dysglycemia,
dyslipidaemia and fatty liver, as well as increase the risk
for development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) [5]. It is found

complications [11]. In the meantime, metformin is also
used for treating T2D, which improves glycemic control
by decreasing hepatic glucose production and glucose
absorption and increasing insulin-mediated glucose
uptake [12]. In addition, Thiazolidinediones (TZDs),
including pioglitazone, are peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) agonists that induce
adipogenesis and have insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic
properties [13]. Recent studies have demonstrated the
beneficial metabolic effects of treatment with pioglitazone
in PCOS patients [11, 14]. These indicated that the
genes and drugs associated with common metabolism
characteristics of PCOS and T2D might be the potential
drug targets and drugs of PCOS.
The research on complex diseases from the
systems level and biological background might provide
new insights into drug target identification, disease gene
exploration and pathogenesis elucidation [15–17]. For
example, disease genes and drug targets of coronary heart
disease (CAD) and T2D could be identified effectively
by systems biology approaches [18, 19]. Chan KH et al.
identified key drivers that included COL1A1, COL3A1,
and ELN in the shared pathways for both CAD and T2D
based on the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)
and genome-wide association studies [20]. In addition,
the highly central importance proteins in core networks
or sub-networks are globally or locally important nodes
which could act as functional modules or pathways or key
role genes to uncover the pathogenesis and therapeutic
ways of disease [21]. For example, Li H et al. presented
a novel PPI knowledge-based approach that identified
functional modules and hub genes for CAD, revealing
several novel pathogenic mechanisms [20]. Wan Li et al.
developed a method using combined centrality indices
on the systems level to identify essential cancer-related
motifs in central roles, which provided a clue for the
study of signal transduction in biological pathways [22].
Furthermore, Emad Fadhal et al. have indicated that the
genes possessing highly topologically centered in the
PPIN may be good therapeutic targets [23].
In this study, based on the pathobiological similarity
of PCOS and T2D, a new computational approach (Figure 1)
was performed to identify the PCOS potential drug target
modules (PPDT-Modules) and PCOS potential drug targets
from the systems level and biological background in the
PPIN. Our study may reveal novel PCOS therapeutic ways
and improve the cure rate of PCOS.

PCOS disease genes) and 923 T-Modules (25 T-Modules
contained one or more T2D disease genes) were identified.
The Jaccard similarity index was calculated for each
P-Module and T-Module pairs. 3 candidate PPDTModules were identified ultimately, including PCOS
disease genes, T2D disease genes and known T2D drug
targets simultaneously (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).

Central importance of genes in PPDT-Modules
Degree, closeness, betweenness, and page rank of
genes in PPDT-Modules were calculated, and the genes
in each module were ranked by these topological metrics,
respectively. The G-rank of genes in PPDT-Modules was
calculated using the geometric mean rank (G- rank of top
22 genes and all genes in PPDT-Module 2are shown in
Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2, respectively).
The PPDT-Modules were the pathobiological
similar modules of PCOS and T2D. The higher genes
of PPDT-Module were ranked, the more important they
might be, and the more kernel roles they would act in
the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. The genes
ESR1, RXRA and NCOA1 were the top three genes not
only in the G-rank of genes, but also in four individual
topological ranks, which demonstrated the stability of
PPDT-Module 2. It was noted that ESR1 (1st) and ESR2
(5th) both ranked highly in the G-rank of genes in PPDTModule 2. They are the main receptors of estrogen and the
metabolism of estrogens was proved to be associated with
the pathogenesis of PCOS [24]. The gene RXRA (2nd)
is always binding with PPARG and function together,
and the gene PPARG is both the PCOS disease gene and
T2D disease gene, is also the known T2D drug target,
and ranked 12th in PPDT-Module 2. The gene NCOA1
(3rd) is one of the known T2D drug targets. In addition,
the gene PPARA, ranked 11th in PPDT-Module 2, is one
of the known T2D targets. So genes which possessed
high G-rank in PPDT-Module might play key roles in the
pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of PCOS.

PCOS potential drug targets
From the functional perspective to analyze the
association between PPDT-Modules and PCOS, the
hyper-geometric test was performed with the genes in
PPDT-Modules and the PCOS disease genes in the Gene
Ontology (GO) and pathways of Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the p value was
adjusted with FDR (P < 0.05, Figure 2A).
The genes of PPDT-Module 1 and PCOS disease
genes, PPDT-Module 3 and PCOS disease genes are
not enriched significantly in the functional categories
related to PCOS, respectively (Figure 2A). The genes of
PPDT-Module 2 and PCOS disease genes are enriched
significantly in functional categories and KEGG pathways
associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS (Figure 2A,

“GO:0005496~steroid binding” are associated with steroid
hormones. Disturbed steroid hormone receptor signaling
pathway would lead to the hormonal imbalance which is
a main underlying problem with PCOS [25]. The steroid
hormones mainly contain the androgens and estrogens and
so on. “GO:0030521~androgen receptor signaling pathway”

and “GO:0050681~androgen receptor binding” are also
associated with androgen. Androgen receptor signaling is an
important mediator in the etiology of PCOS traits [26]. And
androgens mediate their steroidal actions via the androgen
receptor which are crucial in maintaining female fertility by
optimizing follicle growth, health, and ovulation [27]. With
PCOS, women typically have high levels of androgens, high
levels of androgens affect the development and release of
eggs during ovulation [27–29]. “GO:0030520~estrogen
receptor signaling pathway” and “GO:0030331~estrogen
receptor binding” are associated with estrogen. It is noted
that estrogens play important roles in the development and
functioning of the male and female reproductive systems
[30, 31]. The main mediators of estrogen action are 2
specific high-affinity receptors, the ESR1 and ESR2, are

necessary for the proper function of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–ovarian axis and are expressed in the human
ovary, where ESR2 is the predominant receptor and its
activation enhances folliculogenesis and ovulation [32, 33].
The expression of ESR2 is lower in follicles derived from
women with PCOS compared with healthy women, while
ESR1 expression is markedly increased in theca cells
of polycystic ovaries, causing alteration in the ESR1/
ESR2 ratio in PCOS and possibly abnormal follicular
development [34, 35]. Otherwise, insulin resistance is
associated not only with the pathogenesis of T2D, but also
with the pathogenesis of PCOS [36, 37]. The role of ESR1
in the development of insulin resistance has been described
in human with a null mutation in the ESR1, leading to
unresponsiveness to estrogen, who developed impaired
glucose tolerance [34, 38].

“GO:0019216~regulation of lipid metabolic
process”, “GO:0004879~ligand-dependent nuclear
receptor activity” and “GO:0008289~lipid binding”
are associated with lipid metabolism. Abnormal lipid
metabolism is one of the main metabolic characteristics of
PCOS patients [39]. The parameters of lipid metabolism
were significantly different in women with PCOS from in
healthy women, higher triglycerides (TG), and very-lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) with lower highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in PCOS [40, 41].
Altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism
could contribute to insulin resistance in non-obese PCOS
patients [39]. Based on case-controlled studies, women
with PCOS appear to have a high prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome including obesity and dyslipidemia,
and have a higher risk of diabetes [2]. Insulin resistance

features, the average of sensitivity values for normal/
PCOS, PCOS/after pioglitazone treatment were 0.79
and 1, the average of specificity values were 0.68 and 1,
the average of AUCs were 0.72 and 1, the average of
accuracy values were 0.73 and 1, the average of MCC
scores were 0.49 and 1, respectively (Figure 4, Figure 5A,
Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Table 6). At the
same time, the average expression values of PCOS disease
genes, T2D disease genes and known T2D drug targets
were used as the classification features to classify the
same samples of different statuses, respectively (Figure 4,
Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Table 6). Most
of these classification features could classify samples
efficiently.
For the original expression profile, expression
consistency check was performed via Wilcoxon signedrank test to test the sample consistency of the same status
(13 normal samples, 10 PCOS samples and 10 after
pioglitazone treatment samples, FDR P value < 0.05),
respectively. 9 of 13 normal samples and 5 of 10 after
pioglitazone treatment samples were consistent. These 5
samples may alter to a common status after drug treatment,
suggesting similar drug response and good curative
effect of drug treatment, so the paired 5 PCOS/after
pioglitazone treatment samples were selected and a new
SVM was applied to classify the consistent samples of 3
statuses using the above-mentioned classification features
(Figure 4). With identified PCOS potential drug targets as
classification features, the average of sensitivity values
for normal/PCOS, PCOS/after pioglitazone treatment
were 0.95 and 1, the average of specificity values for
normal/PCOS, PCOS/after pioglitazone treatment were
0.88 and 1, average of AUC values of normal /PCOS and
PCOS/after pioglitazone were 0.91 and 1, the average
of accuracy values for normal/PCOS, PCOS/after
pioglitazone treatment were 0.92 and 1,the average of
MCC scores for normal/PCOS, PCOS/after pioglitazone
treatment were 0.84 and 1, respectively (Figure 4,
Figure 5A, Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary
Table 6). The classification performance of consistent
samples was much better than that of all samples from
the original profile with the same classification features,
especially for using the average expression values of
identified PCOS potential drug targets and known T2D
disease genes as classification features (Figure 4, Figure 5,
Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Table 6),
which demonstrated the effectiveness of identified PCOS
potential drug targets. PCOS potential drug targets could
effectively reflect drug response, classify the samples
between normal and disease and between disease and after
drug treatment, as well as represent the treatment effect to
PCOS accurately. Interestingly, identified PCOS potential
drug targets had a better classification performance than
known PCOS disease genes, which demonstrated that
these potential drug targets may act as the PCOS disease
genes (Figure 4, Figure 5, Supplementary Table 5, and

appears to have a pivotal role with multiple studies
demonstrating significant associations between altered
lipid metabolism and insulin level, which may be induced
in part by the insulin-medicated stimulation of lipolysis
and altered expression of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic
lipase [42, 43]. Some studies indicated that disturbance
of transcription, disturbance of steroid hormone, lipid
abnormalities and so on should lead to promoting the
PCOS [44–46].
Meanwhile, “hsa03320:PPAR signaling pathway”
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS and
T2D, and the treatment for T2D. Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors
activated by fatty acids and their derivatives [13]. PPAR
signaling pathway was shown to associate with the
pathogenesis of PCOS, as well as with the pathogenesis
of T2D [13]. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARA, PPARD,
and PPARG), all of them are known T2D drug targets,
are showing different expression patterns. PPARA plays a
role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the
regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism
in liver and skeletal muscle [47]. PPARD is involved in
lipid oxidation and cell proliferation [47, 48]. PPARG
promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood
glucose uptake [49]. Meanwhile, PPARG is both PCOS
and T2D disease gene, the drug targeting to PPARG was
used to treat with PCOS patient and had good curative
effect [13].
These changes of function and disturbance of
pathways were associated not only with PCOS, but also
with T2D closely. So, the genes of PPDT-Module 2 enriched
significantly in these functions, may act as PCOS and T2D
disease genes and drug targets (Figure 2B), such as PPARG.
Known T2D drug targets NCOA1 and PPARA, T2D
disease genes HNF4A, and the PCOS disease genes AR,
CYP11A1 were also enriched in same functional categories
and pathways of PPARG. Meanwhile, these disease genes
and drug targets in PPDT-Module 2 had a high G-Rank,
for instance, NCOA1 ranked 3rd, HNF4A ranked 10th,
PPARA ranked 11th, PPARG ranked 12th. Hence, 22 genes
of PPDT- Module 2 whose G-Rank was the upper quartile
as well as enriched significantly in these PCOS associated
functional categories and pathways were identified as the
PCOS potential drug targets (Figure 3, Table 2).

Efficiency analysis of PCOS potential drug
targets
To assess the efficiency of PCOS potential drug
targets, SVM was applied to classify samples of different
statuses (normal/PCOS, PCOS/after pioglitazone
treatment) of GSE8157 with the average expression values
of identified PCOS potential drug targets as classification
features. 1000 times of five-fold cross-validation were
performed (Figure 4). With the average expression values
of 22 PCOS potential drug targets as the classification

functional categories and pathways that genes of PPDTModule 2 and PCOS disease genes enriched significantly,
are associated not only with pathogenesis and treatment
of T2D, but also with PCOS. Considering the central
importance and functional annotation of known disease
genes and targets, 22 PCOS potential drug targets were
identified. These PCOS potential drug targets could
describe the drug treatment effect well by an independent
profile verified, and the 21 genes (95.45%) had been
verified by literature to be associated with the pathogenesis
and treatment of PCOS (Supplementary Table 4).
Dysfunctions of steroid hormone receptor signaling
pathway, lipid metabolic process, and fatty acid oxidation
are mainly metabolic disturbances of PCOS [44–46].
Identified PPDT-Module 2 had not only a good consistency
function with PCOS but also good classification
performance for classifying normal/PCOS samples and
PCOS/after pioglitazone treatment samples before and
after consistent check. These suggested that PPDT-Module
2 responded to drug treatment efficiently, may be used as
an integral PCOS potential therapeutic target. 22 PCOS
potential drug targets possessed central importance in
PPDT-Module 2 as well as had good consistent function
with PCOS. It was worth noting that 22 PCOS potential
drug targets we identified were all interconnected in
PPDT-Module 2, and had good classification performance,
as same as one with PPDT-Module2, could represent the
whole PPDT-Module 2 well.

Supplementary Table 6). Classification using identified
PPDT-Module 2 as classification features had good
performance for normal /PCOS and for PCOS/after
pioglitazone treatment in both original and consistent
samples (Figure 4B, Figure 5B, Supplementary Table 5,
and Supplementary Table 6).

DISCUSSION
PCOS is a disorder of irregular menses,
hyperandrogenism and/or polycystic ovary morphology
[26]. A large proportion of women with PCOS also exhibit
insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction, impaired glucose
tolerance and/or T2D [50]. Women with T2D have a
higher prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome compared
to the general population [8]. There is also a high rate
of T2D in family members of women with PCOS [50].
Some studies have demonstrated that there are common
biological background and marker between PCOS and
T2D [51]. Based on these, we put forward a new method
to identify 3 candidate PPDT-Modules from the systems
level in the PPIN based on the pathobiological similarity
of PCOS and T2D. Identified PPDT-Modules contained
many PCOS and T2D disease genes, and known T2D
drug targets, simultaneously. By the functional annotation
analysis with the PCOS disease genes, candidate PPDTModule 2 was identified as the final PPDT-Module. The

Recent studies have demonstrated that the beneficial
metabolic effects of treatment with pioglitazone induce
adipogenesis and have insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic
properties in PCOS patients [52, 53]. It is known that
different patients’ response to the drug treatment are
different, thus the efficacy of treatment is various. The
consistent check could identify status-consistent samples
to improve the identification accuracy of disease status
and effectiveness evaluation accuracy of drug response.
The classification performances of samples with consistent
expressions were much better than that of all samples
with the average expression values of PCOS potential
drug targets, PPDT-Module 2, PCOS disease genes,
T2D disease genes and known T2D drug targets as
classification features to classify 3 statuses samples of the
expression profile GSE8157, respectively (Figure 4). In
the meantime, the classification performances of samples
with consistent expressions were also much better than
that of all samples of original expression profile with same
classification features in another independent expression
profile GSE6798 related to PCOS (Supplementary
Figure S1). Interestingly, the classification performances
of PCOS potential drug targets and PPDT-Module 2 as

classification features were better than PCOS disease
genes, T2D disease genes and known T2D drug targets in
both expression profiles (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 5,
Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Table 7).
The potential drug targets and disease genes were
usually identified based on significantly differential
expressed genes [54]. It was noted that between normal
samples and PCOS samples no significantly differential
expressed genes of expression profiles GSE8157 and
GSE6798 could be identified, while between PCOS
samples and after pioglitazone treatment samples of
GSE8157 only few significantly differential expressed
genes could be identified, including no known disease
genes, known drug targets or our interested genes. So
the potential drug targets and disease genes could not
be identified from the point of differential expressed
genes for these two expression profiles. Nevertheless,
identified PPDT-Module 2 and 22 PCOS potential drug
targets could distinguish the statuses between normal
and disease, evaluate the effectiveness of drug treatment
from the systems level and functional point. Just like our
research on the PCOS from the biological background,
previous researchers used the profile GSE8157 to identify

differential pathways instead of differential expressed
genes, for analyzing the pathogenesis of PCOS and
the way of drug response [52]. It was shown that from
the system level and biological background to study
the disease statuses and drug response could obtain
comprehensive and effective results, especially in the case
of no significantly differential expressed genes.
In addition, 21 PCOS potential drug targets
were verified by literatures to be associated with the
pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS, which could reflect
the status of disease and drug response. Drugs targeting
these potential drug targets may be potential drugs for
PCOS. And 42 drugs targeting to 13 PCOS potential drug
targets were verified to be investigated experimentally or
clinically for treating PCOS (Table 3). As a drug target,
PPARG is widely studied and used for T2D, and is also
researched to treat PCOS [55, 56]. There are two classes
of drugs targeting to PPARG for T2D. One is insulin
sensitization agent such as Pioglitazone, Rosiglitazone; the
other is correcting the lipid metabolism disorders agent
such as Repaglinide, Telmisartan. These drugs targeting
to PPARG were highly possible to act as potential drugs
for PCOS. Desogestrel, Ethinyl Estradiol, Clomifene and
Tamoxifen are targeting to ESR1 (1st). Desogestrel as
synthetic progestational hormone component and Ethinyl
Estradiol as estrogenic component in oral contraceptives
were used to improve clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS
in the first-line medicine [57, 58]. Clomifene is a triphenyl
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ethylene stilbene derivative as an estrogen agonist or
antagonist, which is the most commonly used drug for
first-line treatment of ovulation induction in women with
PCOS [59–61].
Some drugs are targeting several PCOS potential
drug targets such as Alitretinoin targeting RXRA, RARA,
RXRB and RARG; Tamoxifen targeting ESR1 and ESR2.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors
(RARs) are nuclear receptors that mediate the biological
effects of retinoids by their involvement in retinoic
acid-mediated gene activation. These receptors function
as transcription factors by binding as homodimers or
heterodimers to specific sequences in the promoters of
target genes. The proteins encoded by these genes are
members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor
superfamily of transcriptional regulators [62]. Alitretinoin
is also known as retinoic acid and derived from maternal
vitamin A. Altered retinoic acid synthesis and action
could influence the expression of these genes and
androgen production in PCOS [63]. Tamoxifen, as one
of the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)
with tissue-specific activities, is discovered to be a good
alternative to clomiphene in women with PCOS and
clomiphene-resistant case [64]. These durgs may play key
roles in treating PCOS by multiple ways.

enhance their impacts [20], we shall make efforts in our
future work to provide a web-server to displaying findings
that can be manipulated by users according to their need.
Our approach was performed based on the existing
known diseases genes and drug targets. As the disease
genes and drug targets increased, our approach would
be more precise. In the meantime, more and more gene
expression datasets and novel drugs are available, which
will make the result evaluation more objective and precise.
The median of the Jaccard similarity indexes was selected
as the threshold to identify the pathobiological similar
modules in our study, which should be further optimized
for the application of other diseases. In addition, the
side-effect and toxicology of the drugs identified by
identified PCOS potential drug targets were not considered
adequately in our study, which will be further improved in
our future work.
We proposed a new computational approach to
identify the PPDT-Module and PCOS potential drug
targets from the systems level and biological background
based on the PPIN and pathobiological similarity. 21
genes of 22 identified PCOS potential drug targets were
verified to be associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS,
and 42 drugs targeting 13 PCOS potential drug targets
were investigated experimentally or clinically for PCOS.
These PCOS potential drug targets and PPDT-Module
could reveal the drug response, distinguish the statuses
between normal and disease, and act as PCOS biomarkers.
Moreover, further research are expected for the ways
of drug response. Our study would shed light on the
treatment of PCOS, and provide new insights to research
on the pahogenesis and drug response of other diseases
that possess high pathobiological similarity.

We put forward a new approach to identify PPDTmodules in the PPIN based on the pathobiological
similarity of PCOS and T2D. (i) PCOS disease genes
and T2D disease genes were set as seeds to filter the no
weight protein-protein interaction network and obtained
the disease genes related no weight 3-step-neighbor
sub-network, respectively. T2D and PCOS related
modules (T-Modules and P-Modules) were mined using
the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL Algorithm) in
the 3-step-neighbor sub-network (no requirement of
minimum number of seeds each cluster needs to contain),
respectively. The MCL algorithm is a fast and scalable
unsupervised cluster algorithm for networks, resulting in
a collection of densely connected groups of genes [71].
The Markov clustering parameter was set to the default
value 1.8. (ii) The pathobiological similar modules were
defined as the intersection of P-Module and T-Module
pairs, if their Jaccard similarity indexes were larger than
their median, and their intersection contained the PCOS
disease genes and T2D disease genes simultaneously. The
Jaccard similarity index J(P,T) reflected the consistency of
each two modules P-Module and T-Module:
J (P, T) = |P∩T|
 (1)
	
|P∪T|
where P is a P-Module and T is a T-Module. The
numerator is the number of common genes in P and T.
The denominator is the number of all genes in P and T.
(iii) Candidate PPDT-Modules were the pathobiological
similar modules that included T2D drug targets, and
PPDT-Modules were the candidate modules which
possessed consistent function with PCOS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Analysis of the central importance of genes in
PPDT-Modules

Data source

The genes possessing more neighbors, more paths
through them and so on, could play the central role
in PPDT-Modules. Hence, the G-rank, Ggi, was used
to evaluate the central importance of gene gi in these
modules, which integrated 4 topological features, degree,
betweenness, closeness and page rank, utilizing the
geometric mean rank:

The Protein-Protein Interaction Network was
obtained from the Human Protein Reference Database
(http://www.hprd.org/) [66], which contained 37041
protein-protein interaction pairs between 9518 proteins.
Our research was based on two gene expression profiles
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) [67] : GSE8157
including 33 samples (13 control samples and 10
PCOS samples before and after pioglitazone treatment,
respectively) and GSE6798 including 29 samples (13
control samples and 16 PCOS samples) in GPL570. 35
PCOS disease genes and 83 T2D disease genes were
extracted from GAD (http://geneticassociationdb.nih.
gov/) [68], DO (http://www.disease-ontology.org/) [69]
and OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omin) [70]; 62
T2D drug targets were extracted from Drug Bank (http://
www.drugbank.ca/) [70].

The degree of gi is the number of edges linked to gi.
The closeness of gi, Cgi, is defined as the inverse of
the average geodesic distance (or length of the shortest

time, we adopted the five-fold cross-validation as done by
many investigators using SVM as the prediction engine
[16, 65]. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC), the
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and MCC score were
calculated. The five-fold cross-validation was applied
1000 times, and the 1000 ROC curves and AUC scores
were obtained to evaluate the robustness of the PCOS
potential drug targets. The higher the AUC score was, the
better the classification performance was.

Identification and analysis of PCOS potential
drug targets
The PCOS potential drug targets were defined as
the genes with high G-ranks (upper quartile) in PPDTModules, as well as correspond to the function of PCOS
disease genes (FDR p < 0.05). The functional annotation
and literature verification were conducted to investigate
the correlation between PCOS potential drug targets and
PCOS. The functional annotation analysis was performed
with all genes in PPDT-Modules and PCOS disease genes
using the hyper-geometric test:
C k C n–k
P(X = k)) = M N–M  (6)
CNn
where N denotes the number of all human genes, n
denotes the number of genes of PPDT-Modules and PCOS
disease genes, M denotes the number of genes in function i,
k denotes the number of genes of PPDT-Modules and PCOS
disease genes in function i. The False Discovery Rate (FDR)
method was used to correct p-value, and p-value < 0.05 was
set as the criterion for this analysis [72–74].
