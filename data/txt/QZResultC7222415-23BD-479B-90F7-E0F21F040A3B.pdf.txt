ABSTRACT
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and while great advances have
been made particularly in chemotherapy, many types of cancer still present a dismal
prognosis. In the case of glioma, temozolomide (TMZ) is the main option for treatment,
but it has limited success due to drug resistance. While this resistance is usually
associated to DNA repair mechanisms, in this work we demonstrate that oxidative
stress plays an important role. We showed that upon TMZ treatment there is an
induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which is the main
antioxidant transcription factor regulator in human cells. This is accompanied by an
enhancement of glutathione (GSH) concentration in the tumor cells. The effectiveness
of this pathway was proven by silencing NFR2, which greatly enhanced cell death upon
TMZ treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Also, higher DNA damage and induced cell
death was observed by combining BSO - a GSH inhibitor - with TMZ. Similar effects
were also observed using in vitro and in vivo models of melanoma, thus possibly
indicating that GSH has a decisive role in TMZ resistance in a wider range of tumors.
Thus, a combined regimen of BSO and TMZ configures an interesting therapeutic
alternative for fighting both glioma and melanoma.

dacarbazine (DTIC), fotemustine or cisplatin [5], and, as
it is the case with glioma, TMZ.
Nevertheless, as revealed by glioma and melanoma
patients’ average survival rates, current chemotherapeutic
protocols have limited success. This occurs mainly due to
drug resistance. Several mechanisms command resistance
and many of those are tissue and/or drug specific. Thus,
it is crucial to fully understand chemotherapy resistance
mechanisms in order to develop new approaches to
overcome it, improving the efficacy of therapy protocols.
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent
that causes methylation on DNA bases in several
positions, ultimately leading to cell death. Many DNA
repair mechanisms are involved in resolution of DNA
damage induced by TMZ, such as base excision repair
(BER), mismatch repair (MMR) and direct repair by O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In fact,
until now, the main known TMZ resistance mechanisms are
related to the DNA repair capacity of the cells [6]. However,
its is important to notice that due to poor drug response

INTRODUCTION
Malignant gliomas are the most common type of
primary brain tumors in adults, with an incidence rate
of approximately 5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants [1]. It
is also one of most aggressive types of cancer. Patients
diagnosed with glioma have a dismal prognosis, with a
median survival rate of 15 months and a 5-year survival
rate of ~2% [2]. Current therapy includes surgery for tumor
resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or concomitant
adjuvant chemotherapy. The main chemotherapy protocol
for this type of tumor is based on temozolomide (TMZ)
[3].
Metastatic melanoma shares several of glioma’s
features, in particular, high aggressiveness and poor
prognosis. The average survival rate for melanoma
patients with brain metastasis is about 4 months and a
complete cure is observed in less than 1% of the patients
[4]. Besides surgery and radiotherapy, melanoma patients
are usually submitted to chemotherapy treatment with

of GSH synthesis [9]. In a previous work, we observed
a significant difference in GSH levels between glioma
cell lines [17], leading us to hypothesize that this could
be due to NRF2 differential gene expression. In fact, real
time PCR analysis indicated that the U138MG, when
compared to the U87MG cell line, displayed higher NRF2
mRNA expression. Similarly, higher levels of mRNA
expression were observed for NRF2 target genes, such as
the glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM)
and glutathione S-transferase (GSTπ), involved in GSH
synthesis and utilization, respectively (Figure 1A-1B).
Furthermore, TMZ treatment elicited a robust induction
of NRF2, GCLM and GSTπ mRNA in the two glioma cell
lines (Figure 1A-1B). Different levels of NRF2 between
cells lines and TMZ-induction of NRF2 were confirmed
for protein expression, by western blot analysis. As shown
in Figure 1C-1D, NRF2 protein expression was 3-fold
higher at basal levels in U138MG cells in comparison
to U87MG cells. Moreover, NRF2 expression increased
3-fold in U87MG and 2-fold in U138MG cell lines upon
TMZ treatment.

or tumor relapse observed upon TMZ treatment it is
reasonable to speculate that other mechanisms are involved
in drug resistance. In this context, it was recently shown
that clinical achievable doses of TMZ induced high levels
of mitochondrial DNA damage in human myeloid precursor
cells [7]. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2010) demonstrated
for the first time that the treatment of glioblastoma cells
with TMZ increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.
This was related to the activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase, leading to cellular apoptosis [8]. Thus, oxidative
stress induced upon TMZ treatment may play an important
role in cell death induced by this drug.
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 2 (NRF2) is well
known as the master regulator of antioxidant response,
maintaining redox homeostasis in the cells [9]. Under
physiological conditions NRF2 binds to KEAP1 (Kelchlike ECH associated protein 1), which directs NRF2
continuously to proteasome degradation. However, in
oxidative stress situations, KEAP1 is oxidized and NRF2
is readily translocated into the nucleus where it can
activate many different genes [10]. Among those, NRF2
controls the expression of two enzymes responsible for
glutathione (GSH) synthesis, namely Glutamate-cysteine
ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and Glutamate-cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), and also enzymes related
to GSH utilization such as glutathione redutase, glutathione
peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) [11].
GSH is a highly abundant, low-molecular-weight
peptide in the cell, that plays a critical role in maintaining the
cellular redox balance, acting as a free radical scavenger [12].
Additionally, GSH has a protective role against xenobiotic
agents due to its highly reactive thiol group binds that
inactivates those agents [13]. In fact, the GSH content and
GST activity have long been associated with chemotherapy
resistance in numerous cell lines and tumor tissues [14,15,16].
In this work, using either TMZ-sensitive or
resistant glioma cell lines, we observed that NRF2 plays
a crucial role in TMZ resistance. We showed that the
transcriptional factor NRF2 mediates TMZ resistance
through GSH synthesis and utilization. NRF2 silencing
greatly sensitized glioma cells to TMZ both in vitro and
in vivo. Importantly, GSH depletion by L-buthionine
[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH-synthesis inhibitor,
strongly potentiated TMZ-induced DNA damage and
cell death in glioma and melanoma cell lines (in vitro
and in vivo). Thus, the combination of BSO with TMZ is
proposed as an extremely powerful approach to improve
chemotherapy efficacy in both tumors, providing a new
exciting alternative to treat these types of neoplasia.

NRF2 induces GSH synthesis as a protective
mechanism upon TMZ treatment
Next, we measured the intracellular GSH levels
in U87MG and U138MG cells submitted or not to TMZ
treatment. As previously described, U138MG cell line has
a higher GSH level when compared to U87MG. Moreover,
TMZ treatment (24 h) was able to triple and double GSH
levels in U87MG and U138MG, respectively (Figure 2A).
In order to evaluate the role of GSH in TMZ
resistance, we modulated GSH levels using BSO or
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a GSH synthesis inhibitor and
precursor, respectively. As GSH is crucial to maintain
redox homeostasis, we measured intracellular ROS
levels in cells pre-treated with BSO or NAC, treated
or not with TMZ for two hours. Although there was
a significant increase in ROS levels when cells were
treated with BSO, the levels were much higher when
treatment was performed with TMZ in combination with
BSO. Furthermore, NAC was able to inhibit the small
TMZ ROS induction (Figure 2B). To examine possible
sources of ROS induced after treatment with TMZ,
acute mitochondrial ROS formation was measured using
MitoSOX Red. Quantitative analysis indicated that TMZ
treatment significantly increased mitochondrial production
of ROS (Figure 2C).
Next, nuclear DNA damage from ROS generated after
TMZ treatment for 2 h was evaluated. Thus, we performed
a modified alkaline comet assay using the FPG enzyme.
FPG is a DNA glycosylate that identifies oxidized guanines,
such as 8-oxoguanine, on the DNA molecule. It cleaves at
the N-glycosydic bond, which is detected in comet assay as
single strand DNA breaks [18]. In fact, TMZ generates large
amounts of FPG-sensitive sites on nuclear DNA. Furthermore,

showed a greater sensitivity to TMZ treatment, as shown
by the XTT cell viability assay (Figure 3B). Besides that,
U138MG shNRF2 cells displayed a higher TMZ apoptosis
induction than the shCTRL cell line. This is indicated
by the increased sub-G1 population (Figure 3C-3D) and
caspase-3 activation (Figure 3E). We also observed an
increase in the amount of DNA damage induced by TMZ
in shNRF2 cells in comparison to shCTRL cells, as seen
by γH2AX positive cells (Figure 3F). Similar results were
obtained with U87MG shNRF2 cells (data not shown). Due
to notably difficulty of U138MG in forming tumor in nude
mice, we performed in vivo procedures using U87MG cells.

NRF2 silencing potentiates TMZ cell death
induction in vitro
To gain further insights concerning the role of NRF2
as a mediator of TMZ resistance, we established NRF2silenced cell lines using an shRNA lentiviral system. As
shown in Figure 3A there was a substantial decrease in
NRF2 protein level in the U138MG shNRF2 cell line,
when compared to U138MG shCTRL cells. A similar
significant decrease was observed in the mRNA expression
of NRF2, GCML and GSTπ in NRF2 depleted cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). Notably, U138MG shNRF2

U87MG shNRF2 and U87MG shCTRL cells on each
side of the animal’s flanks were submitted to vehicle
(0.5% DMSO in PBS) or TMZ (30 mg/kg) treatment. A
significant slower progression on shNRF2 tumors was
observed, when compared to shCTRL tumor (Figure 4A4C), even in the absence of any treatment. In addition,
upon TMZ treatment, there was a greater inhibition of
tumor growth on shNRF2 tumors when compared to
shCTRL (Figure 4A-4C). Also, GSH and thiol levels
measured on tumors were 4-fold lower in the shNRF2
cell line in comparison to control cells (Figure 4D and

Supplementary Figure S2), indicating an inhibitory effect
on GSH production in NRF2-depleted cells in vivo.

TMZ cytotoxicity in glioma and melanoma cells
Patients with metastatic melanoma resistant to
treatment with BRAF inhibitor or immunotherapy,
are treated with DTIC, a TMZ analog [19]. Thus, we
hypothesized that GSH could be involved in TMZ
resistance in melanoma as well. Thereby, GSH modulation

could enhance TMZ cytotoxicity in melanoma cells as we
observed for glioma cells. U138MG glioma cell line and
two human melanoma cell lines (SK MEL28, SK MEL94)
and a murine melanoma cell line (B16) were treated with
TMZ in combination to BSO or ezatiostat (EZA), a GST
inhibitor. The concentrations of these substances (BSO
or EZA) were such that no cytotoxicity was observed for
any of the cell lines, in the absence of TMZ. Cell viability
was evaluated three days after treatment and we observed
that, in all cell lines, BSO as well as EZA were able to
substantially potentiate TMZ cell killing effect (Figure
5A-5C and Supplementary Figure S3).

To investigate if the synergistic effect of TMZ
combined with BSO also occurs in vivo, we inoculated
B16 into C57Bl/6 animals divided into 4 experimental
groups: 1) vehicle (0.5% DMSO in PBS); 2) BSO (450
mg/kg); 3) TMZ (30 mg/kg); 4) TMZ + BSO. B16 is
well known by its high proliferative capacity and drug
resistance [20]. We observed a measurable tumor 6
days after cell inoculation and at day 15 the animals
were euthanized due to the high tumor burden (2,000
mm3). In fact, there was a 70-fold increase in tumor
size compared to its initial volume in vehicle and BSO
groups after 9 days (Figure 5D-5E). In the TMZ treated

group, there was an approximate 40-fold increase in
tumor volume, and we observed a remarkable reduction
of tumor progression in the TMZ+BSO group (about 10fold increase over the entire treatment period). Together
these results indicate that GSH plays a central role in the
promotion of TMZ resistance, not only in glioma, but
also in melanoma cells.

cross the blood brain barrier, a indispensable feature to
treat brain tumors [24]. In fact, after being approved by the
FDA in 2005, TMZ readily became the first line therapy
to treat glioma [23]. However, glioma resistance towards
TMZ cell death induction severely limited drug efficacy,
and as consequence, this type of cancer remains incurable.
Several mechanisms are known to be involved
on TMZ resistance. Most of them are related to DNA
repair processes, which is not surprising given the
fact that TMZ induces DNA damage [6]. In fact, many
reports demonstrate a clear correlation between DNA
repair mechanisms and TMZ resistance both in vitro
and in vivo [26,27,28,29,30]. Despite a promising
report on the use of a combination of TMZ and MGMT
inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) [29], the outcomes
of several clinical trials were not that encouraging. For
instance, phase-II clinical trials using O6-BG showed no
improvement on TMZ efficacy for patients with adult
recurrent glioma [32] or pediatric high-grade glioma [31].

DISCUSSION
Over the last decades several cancer patients, such as
those with testicular and breast tumors, truly beneficiated
from antitumor drug development [21]. However, that
is not the case for patients with glioma or metastatic
melanoma, which face a dreadful prognosis even with all
possible clinical therapeutic protocols available [22, 25].
Recently, the alkylating agent TMZ has received
special attention, in particular for being one of few orally
administered antitumor drugs, and for its ability to easily

Thus, we reasoned that other important mechanisms could
be involved in TMZ resistance.
Working with the U87MG cell line, Zhang
et al. [8] observed a 2-fold increase in ROS production
upon incubation with 250 μM TMZ for 2 h. Recently, it
was demonstrated that TMZ, besides genomic DNA, also
reacts with mitochondrial DNA [7] and Cai et al. showed
that by targeting MGMT to the mitochondria, the cells
are protected against TMZ [32]. Thus, mitochondrial
malfunctioning could be the source of ROS production
by TMZ. In the present study, we found an increase on
mitochondrial ROS production after TMZ treatment. More
importantly, we showed that NAC was able to completely
inhibit ROS availability, and BSO significantly increased
ROS levels in combination with TMZ. Furthermore, we
observed a pronounced increase in oxidized DNA lesion
after treatment with BSO plus TMZ, when compared to
DNA damage levels generated by the drugs alone. Those

results suggest a central role of GSH in mitigating ROS
induced after treatment with TMZ.
In a previous work, we showed that the TMZ
resistant cell line U138MG presented higher intracellular
GSH levels than the more sensitive U87MG cells and drug
resistance was abolished when TMZ was combined with
BSO, both in vitro and in vivo [17]. In the present work,
we described a significant difference between the two
cell lines concerning NRF2 expression. In fact, U138MG
cells presented significant higher levels of NRF2 as well
as genes related to GSH synthesis and utilization than
U87MG cells. These results are in agreement with our
previous findings [17], and offer a reasonable explanation
for the higher levels of GSH found in the resistant cell line.
Recently, it was demonstrated that NRF2 silencing in
glioma cell lines inhibited cell proliferation [33], decreased
cellular migration [34], and induced autophagic process [35].
Here we went further and showed that NRF2 silencing results

in greater sensitivity and higher apoptosis induction upon
TMZ treatment. Using an in vivo model, we also observed a
pronounced decrease in tumor progression in NRF2 shRNA
tumors on untreated animals, indicating that NRF2 plays
a fundamental role on tumor growth rate. In addition, we
found a significant decrease in GSH and thiol levels on NRF2
silenced tumors. More importantly, we observed an additive
effect between TMZ treatment and NRF2-depletion. These
results strongly indicate that GSH levels play a crucial role
on TMZ resistance and also that GSH availability is tightly
regulated by NRF2 in glioma cells.
In general, tumor cells present higher levels of GSH
than normal ones and, as a consequence, they seem to
be more dependent on GSH [36,37]. Thus, therapeutic
strategies that modulate GSH levels are tempting
therapeutic alternatives. BSO is an irreversible selective
inhibitor of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), and its
administration is able to deplete the GSH level by up to
90% in many cell lines both in vitro as well as in vivo [38].
Another interesting strategy is to disrupt GSH utilization
by inhibiting GST enzymes, which could be done by
incubation with EZA [39]. We found that the combination
of BSO or EZA with TMZ greatly potentiated cell death
induction of glioma cell lines in vitro.
Previous to TMZ, its analogue, DTIC was the most
important methylating agent used in the clinic. DTIC was
approved nearly 30 years ago and remains the reference
drug to treat metastatic melanoma, even though complete
response is achieved in less than 10% of patients [40].

DTIC needs to be metabolized in the liver in order to be
activated and is unable to cross the blood brain barrier.
Thus, DTIC is useless against brain metastasis, which is
observed in about 60% of metastatic melanoma patients
[4]. A phase III clinical trial comparing DTIC and TMZ
showed that both drugs have equivalent impact on overall
survival, but there was improvement on life quality in
patients treated with TMZ [19]. Thus, TMZ is a valid
therapeutic alternative to treat metastatic melanoma [41].
Based on that, we were interested to find out if TMZ
resistance due to GSH availability was glioma specific
or alternatively could be seen in other tumors, such as
melanoma. In fact, combination of TMZ with either BSO
or EZA had a profound impact on viability of melanoma
cells in comparison to the cells treated with TMZ alone.
The increased sensitivity to TMZ induced by EZA
indicates that GSH may be acting as a detoxification agent
towards TMZ. Furthermore, as previously mentioned,
BSO in combination with TMZ was able to increase ROS
production, which suggests that GSH is also protecting
the tumor cells from TMZ as an antioxidative agent.
Nevertheless, depletion of GSH using BSO is sufficient
to inhibit both protective mechanisms (antioxidative
and detoxification process), once it is limiting GSH
availability. Remarkably, BSO plus TMZ substantially
inhibited melanoma tumor progression in vivo.
In Figure 6 we summarize our findings, proposing
a model to explain TMZ resistance mediated by NRF2.
TMZ is an alkylating drug that inserts a methyl group

Figure 6: Proposed model of NRF2 role on TMZ resistance. TMZ induces genomic and mitochondrial DNA methylation damage.

Mitochondrial DNA damage could lead to malfunction of this organelle, increasing its ROS production, which in turn activates NRF2. This
transcription factor induces expression of genes related to GSH synthesis and utilization. GSH could act as an antioxidant (neutralizing
ROS induced upon TMZ treatment) or detoxification agent (by GSH binding to TMZ through GST activity, eliminating TMZ inside the
cells). Increased NRF2 activity, leading to higher GSH levels, would be a key resistance mechanism to TMZ. Thus, we propose the use of
the GSH inhibitor, BSO, in combination with TMZ to circumvent resistance to this drug in glioma and melanoma tumor.

on DNA bases. In this work, we showed that upon TMZ
treatment there was an increase on ROS production due,
at least in part, to mitochondria damage, which seems to
be the trigger for the induction of NRF2 and consequently
increase GCLM and GSTπ expression upon TMZ
treatment. As a consequence, there is a significant increase
of GSH availability and utilization, respectively, which, in
turn, mediate TMZ resistance. Notably, we demonstrated
that GSH depletion, using BSO, is responsible to
circumvent TMZ drug resistance in glioma and melanoma
cell lines.
Together our results indicate determinant roles of
NRF2 in conferring TMZ tumor resistance mainly by
induction of GSH synthesis and utilization. Thus, we
propose that NRF2 is an important molecular marker to
TMZ resistance and the use of BSO in combination with
TMZ as an alternative therapeutic approach for fighting
glioma and melanoma.

0.1% Triton X-100. The percentage of sub-G1 cells
was calculated using the CytoSoft software (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). For γH2AX and active caspase-3
immunostaining, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde
and then with 70% ethanol. Afterwards, the cells were
blocked, permeabilized, incubated with either primary
mouse monoclonal antibody to γH2AX (Ser-139) (Upstate
Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA) and diluted
1:500, or mouse anti-active caspase 3 (BD, Pharmigen,
San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:50 for 2 h at room
temperature. This was followed by incubation with antimouse FITC secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) that was
diluted 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. The percentage
of γH2AX positive cells was again calculated using the
CytoSoft software (Millipore).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ROS levels were analyzed using a DCFDA
(2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, Invitrogen) probe
and Mitosox (Life Technologies), according to the
manufaturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were detached with
trypsin and incubated for 30 min with 10 μM of DCFDA
or for 15 min with 5 μM of Mitosox in DMEM without
phenol red containing 0.2% FBS. The mean green or red
fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry.

Cell lines and culture conditions
Certified human glioma cell lines U87MG and
U138MG; human melanoma cells lines SKMEL 28 and
SKMEL 94 as well as murine melanoma B16 were kindly
provided by Prof. Bernd Kaina, Germany. Human glioma
and melanoma cells were routinely grown in DMEM
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
and murine melanoma was grown in RPMI (Invitrogen).
All culture media were supplemented with 10% FCS
(fetal calf serum; Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil) and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2
atmosphere.

Glutathione quantification
Intracellular GSH levels were quantified using the
GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay (Promega), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2×104 cells were
seeded in opaque, 96-well plates and allowed to grow for
24 h under cell culture conditions. Cells were washed with
PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a
solution containing luciferin NT substrate and glutathioneS-transferase. Then, 100 μL of luciferase enzyme was
added, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Luminescence was measured using a Glomax-Multi+
Luminometer (Promega). Serial dilution of a GSH
standard solution was used to generate a standard curve,
and GSH concentration was normalized to the protein
concentration of each well.

Cell survival measurement
In a 12 multi-well plate, 2×104 cells were plated and
pre-treated for 16 h with 100 μM BSO (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) or 1 mM NAC (Sigma-Aldrich),
followed by incubation with increasing doses of TMZ for
72 h. After that, the cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation with XTT
reagent kit as recommended by the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

Total reduced thiol levels

Flow cytometry for sub-G1, active caspase-3 and
γH2AX analysis

Total reduced thiols were determined in a
spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3300, Tokyo, Japan)
using 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Thiol
residues react with DTNB, cleaving the disulfide bond
to give 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (NTB-), which ionizes to
the NTB2- di-anion in water at neutral and alkaline pH.
The NTB2- was quantified in a spectrophotometer by
measuring the absorbance at 412 nm, and was expressed
as nmol of reduced DTNB/mg protein [42].

The apoptotic response after genotoxic drug
treatment was measured using flow cytometry for
sub-G1 determination. Supernatant and attached cells
were collected, washed once with PBS and fixed in 70%
ethanol. Ethanol-fixed cells were stained with propidium
iodide (PI) at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing
20 μg/ml PI (Sigma–Aldrich), 200 μg/ml RNase A, and

after overnight lysis, the comet slides were washed in
FPG glycosylase buffer (40 mM Hepes pH 7, 10 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM DTT), and incubated for 30 min at 37°C
with FPG (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA)
at 8 U/ml in 1× NEBuffer 1, supplemented with 100 μg/
ml BSA (both supplied by the manufacturer). One half
of each slide was incubated with the enzyme, while the
other half was incubated with the same solution, except
for glycosylase (negative control). Comets were stained
with ethidium bromide, imaged with a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus, Center Valley,
PA, USA), and at least 50 comets per slide were scored
for each condition.

pLV/Luc lentiviral vector was generated as
previously described [17]. This plasmid was co-transfected
with three auxiliary plasmids into HEK 293FT cells using
the polyethyleneimine (PEI) method. The recombinant
lentivirus was then used to transduce U87MG shCTRL
or U87MG shNRF2, resulting in the stable-expressing
luciferase glioma cell lines (Luc cells).

In vivo procedures
Xenograft tumors were established in 10-12-weekold, female, athymic nude mice. U87MG shCTRL or
U87MG shNRF2 Luc cells (3×106) were inoculated
subcutaneously in the animal’s flank. Tumors were allowed
to grow, and approximately 3 weeks after inoculation,
treatment began. Tumor volume was calculated according
to the following formula: volume = (width2 × length)/2.
Animals were randomized into 2 treatment groups: (1)
vehicle (0.5% DMSO diluted on PBS); (2) TMZ (30
mg/kg). TMZ was injected i.p. for 3 consecutive days,
followed by a 2-day interval and subsequent 3 consecutive
days of drug treatment.
B16 cells (105) were injected into C57Bl/6 mice The
animals were randomized into 4 treatment groups: (1) vehicle
BSO was inoculated i.p. 5 h before TMZ treatment for three
consecutive days. All animal procedures were approved
by the Ethics Committee for Animal Care and Use of the
Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo.

Western blot
Cells were lysed and cell protein extraction
was quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, EUA). Proteins
were separated on an SDS–polyacrylamide gel and
blotted onto a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). Membranes were
blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS, and
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody
against anti-NRF2 (1:500) and anti-GAPDH (1:2000)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
A chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) was
used to develop the membranes, and the luminescence
intensity was determined using an ImageQuant 300 (GE
Healthcare).

Bioluminescence imaging
For in vivo luciferase assays, 150 mg/kg D-luciferin
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was inoculated i.p. into
nude mice to measure the tumor size. Bioluminescence
images were obtained using the IVIS Spectrum system
(Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) at the
CEFAP-USP facility.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using PureLink RNA Mini
kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
After DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) treatment,
cDNA was prepared using a High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies). Gene expression was determined by realtime quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Briefly, 3 μL of diluted
cDNA, 6 μL of SYBR green master mix, 0.5 μL of 10
mM forward and reverse primers and nuclease-free water
were used in a combined total volume of 12 μL for each
reaction. Q-PCR was carried out using the 7500 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The relative
expression levels of the genes of interest were calculated
using the relative standard curve method, based on the
individual Q-PCR primer efficiencies, and the quantified
values were normalized against the housekeeping gene
encoding GAPDH.

Statistical analysis
Results represent the mean of three independent
experiments, each performed in triplicate, with error bars
showing the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
significance among data sets was accessed by applying
one-way ANOVA followed by Bonfferoni post-testing
(Prism 6 –GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA) (*P<0.05,
**P<0.01, ***P<0.001).
