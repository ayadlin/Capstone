Abstract
EGFR is upregulated in the majority of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, many patients
with HNSCC respond poorly to the EGFR inhibitors (EGFRI)
cetuximab and erlotinib, despite tumor expression of EGFR.
Gene expression analysis of erlotinib-treated HNSCC cells
revealed an upregulation of genes involved in MyD88-dependent signaling compared with their respective vehicle-treated
cell lines. We therefore investigated whether MyD88-dependent
signaling may reduce the antitumor efﬁcacy of EGFRIs in
HNSCC. Erlotinib signiﬁcantly upregulated IL6 secretion in
HNSCC cell lines, which our laboratory previously reported
to result in reduced drug efﬁcacy. Suppression of MyD88
expression blocked erlotinib-induced IL6 secretion in vitro and
increased the antitumor activity of erlotinib in vivo. There was
little evidence of Toll-like receptor or IL18 receptor involve-

ment in erlotinib-induced IL6 secretion. However, suppression
of IL1R signaling signiﬁcantly reduced erlotinib-induced IL6
production. A time-dependent increase of IL1a but not IL1b
was observed in response to erlotinib treatment, and IL1a
blockade signiﬁcantly increased the antitumor activity of erlotinib and cetuximab in vivo. A pan-caspase inhibitor reduced
erlotinib-induced IL1a secretion, suggesting that IL1a was
released because of cell death. Human HNSCC tumors showed
higher IL1a mRNA levels compared with matched normal
tissue, and IL1a was found to be negatively correlated with
survival in patients with HNSCC. Overall, the IL1a/IL1R/
MYD88/IL6 pathway may be responsible for the reduced antitumor efﬁcacy of erlotinib and other EGFRIs, and blockade of
IL1 signaling may improve the efﬁcacy of EGFRIs in the treatment of HNSCC. Cancer Res; 75(8); 1657–67. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

and of limited duration (2–3 months). Similarly, low response
rates (4%–11%) have been observed in clinical trials with patients
with HNSCC treated with geﬁtinib and erlotinib (2–5). Many
different mechanisms (e.g., existing/acquired mutations and
alternative signaling pathways) have been proposed that may
reduce patient response to EGFRIs, but this knowledge has not
improved survival rates for patients with HNSCC to date (6–9).
Previous studies in our laboratory observed a signiﬁcant upregulation in IL6 expression in HNSCC cell lines treated with
EGFRIs (10). IL6 is a pleotropic cytokine with a wide range of
biologic activities and is well known for its role in inﬂammation,
tumor progression, and chemoresistance in HNSCC (11–14). We
additionally demonstrated the ability of IL6 signaling to protect
HNSCC against erlotinib treatment in vitro and in vivo (10)
supporting prior reports showing that IL6 may be involved in
resistance to EGFRIs (15–18).
A well-established mechanism of IL6 production involves the
cytosolic adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary
response gene 88 (MyD88), which acts through intermediaries
to induce NF-kB activation (19). MyD88 is required for the
activity of members of the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) superfamily,
which include Toll-like receptors (TLR), the IL1R, and IL18R (19).
Activation of these receptors leads to the recruitment of MyD88
via its TIR domain, resulting in NF-kB activation and expression of
proinﬂammatory cytokines, including IL6 (19). Here we show
that EGFR inhibition using erlotinib activates the IL1a/IL1R/
MyD88/IL6 signaling pathway and this pathway may serve as a
novel mechanism responsible for the poor long-term antitumor
efﬁcacy of EGFRIs in HNSCC therapy.

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates numerous prosurvival pathways including Akt and STAT3 signaling pathways
(1). Given that EGFR signaling is upregulated in many cancers
especially head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
several drugs that target EGFR have been developed and approved
for cancer therapy such as monoclonal antibodies that block
the extracellular ligand binding domain (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
that prevent activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain
(e.g., geﬁtinib, erlotinib; ref. 1). To date, only cetuximab is FDAapproved for use in HNSCC; however, it should be noted that
response rates to cetuximab as a single agent are quite low (13%)

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions
Cal-27 and FaDu human HNSCC cells were obtained from the
ATCC. SQ20B HNSCC cells (20) were a gift from Dr. Anjali Gupta
(Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Iowa,
Iowa City, IA). All HNSCC cell lines are EGFR-positive and are
sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. All cell lines were authenticated by
the ATCC for viability (before freezing and after thawing), growth,
morphology, and isoenzymology. Cells were stored according to
the supplier's instructions and used over a course of no more than
3 months after resuscitation of frozen aliquots. Cultures were
maintained in 5% CO2 and air humidiﬁed in a 37 C incubator.
In vitro drug treatment
Erlotinib (Tarceva), anakinra (Kineret), and N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC; Acetadote) were obtained from the inpatient pharmacy at
the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Drugs were added to
cells at ﬁnal concentrations of 5 mmol/L erlotinib, 10 or 50 ng/mL
anakinra, and 20 mmol/L NAC. Human IgG and DMSO were used
as controls and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. PEGylated
catalase (CAT; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a ﬁnal concentration of
100 U/mL. Human IL1a, IL1b, and IL18Ra neutralizing antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems and were used at a
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Recombinant human IL1a was
obtained from Life Technologies and administered at a concentration of 1 ng/mL. Ac-Y-VAD-cho (CalBioChem) was suspended
in DMSO and used at 5 mmol/L. Z-VAD-fmk (Promega) was
diluted in DMSO and used at 20 mmol/L. TLR agonists were
used at the following concentrations: Pam3CSK4 (200 ng/mL),
FSL-1 (100 ng/mL), Poly I:C (20 mg/mL), lipopolysaccharide (200
ng/mL), ﬂagellin (200 ng/mL), gardiquimod (1 mg/mL), CL075
(1 mg/mL), and Escherichia coli DNA (1 mg/mL). All TLR agonists
were obtained from InvivoGen. The required volume of each drug
was added directly to complete cell culture media on cells to
achieve the indicated ﬁnal concentrations.
Microarray analyses
Gene expression analysis of HNSCC cells treated with DMSO or
erlotinib (5 mmol/L, 48 hours) has been described previously
(GeneBank accession no. GSE45891; ref. 10). Downstream pathway, network, process, and disease analyses of the resultant gene
expression data for all cell lines (n ¼ 3 experiments per cell line)
was carried out using MetacoreTM (GeneGo) using a threshold of
þ1.3 and a P value of 0.05. Enrichment analysis of the resultant
gene expression proﬁles of SQ20B and Cal-27 HNSCC cells
exposed to erlotinib versus DMSO was performed by mapping
gene IDs from the resultant dataset onto gene IDs in built-in
functional ontologies, which include cellular/molecular process
networks, disease biomarker networks, canonical pathway maps,
and metabolic networks.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells after indicated time
points using RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). Conversion of RNA
into cDNA was accomplished with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Bio-Rad) and a thermocycler with the following conditions:
5 minutes at 25 C, 30 minutes at 42 C, and 5 minutes at 85 C.
Subsequent RT-PCR analysis was performed in a 96-well optical
plate with each well containing 6 mL of cDNA, 7.5 mL of SyBr Green
Universal SuperMix (Bio-Rad), and 1.5 mL of oligonucleotide

1658 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

primers (sense and antisense; 4 mmol/L) for a total reaction
volume of 15 mL. Oligonucleotide primers for human genes were
obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and are as
listed in Supplementary Table SI. RT-PCR was performed on ABI
PRISM Sequence Detection System (model 7000, Applied Biosystems) with the following protocol: 95 C for 15 seconds (denaturing) and 60 C for 60 seconds (annealing), repeated for 40
cycles. Threshold cycle (CT) values for analyzed genes (in duplicate) were normalized as compared to GAPDH (cell lines) or 18S
(human samples) CT values. Relative abundance was calculated as
0.5^(DCT), with DCT being the CT value of the analyzed gene
minus the CT value of the reference gene (GAPDH or 18S).
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were standardized for protein content, resolved on
4% to -12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-MyD88 (1:500,
Cell Signaling), anti-IL1R1 (1:500, Santa Cruz), and anti-b-actin
(1:5,000, Thermo Scientiﬁc). Antibody binding was detected by
using an ECL Chemiluminescence kit (Amersham).
ELISA
Levels of IL6, IL1a, and IL1b of treated cells were determined by
ELISA. The culture media of the treated cells were harvested and
each cytokine was detected according to the manufacturer's protocol using Human Quantikine ELISA Kits (R&D Systems).
Adenoviral vectors
Construction and characterization of adenoviral vectors encoding wild-type and dominant-negative NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4)
have each been described previously (10, 21). An empty vector
lacking the NOX4 construct was used as a control. All vectors were
obtained from the University of Iowa Gene Vector Core. HNSCC
cells in serum-free media were infected with 100 multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of the above-described adenoviral vectors for 24
hours. Biochemical analyses were performed 72 to 96 hours after
transfection.
siRNA/shRNA transfection
MyD88, TLR2, TLR5, and control siRNA (Santa Cruz) were
transfected into HNSCC cells at a concentration of 40 to 80 nmol/L
with equal volume Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Cells
were incubated in Opti-MEM for 4 hours before addition of
siRNA and 16 hours after addition of siRNA. For shRNA transfection, SQ20B cells were transfected with 1 mg/mL of psiRNAh7SKGFPzeo, psiRNA-shMyD88, or psiRNA-shIL1R (Invivogen)
in the presence of Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX.
Cells were allowed to recover 48 to 72 hours in antibiotic-free
DMEM with 10% FBS before 48-hour erlotinib treatment. Knockdown was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR and/or Western blotting.
Clonogenic survival assay
Clonogenic survival was determined as previously described
(22). Individual assays were performed with multiple dilutions
with at least 4 cloning dishes per data point, repeated in at least
three separate experiments.
Tumor cell implantation
Male and female athymic nu/nu mice (4–5 weeks old) were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories. Mice were housed in a

pathogen-free barrier room in the Animal Care Facility at the
University of Iowa and handled using aseptic procedures. All
procedures were approved by the IACUC committee of the
University of Iowa and conformed to the guidelines established
by the NIH. Mice were allowed at least 3 days to acclimate before
beginning experimentation, and food and water were made freely
available. Tumor cells were inoculated into nude mice by subcutaneous injection of 0.1-mL aliquots of saline containing 2  106
SQ20B cells into the right ﬂank using 26-gauge needles.
In vivo drug administration
Mice started drug treatment 1 week after tumor inoculation. For
the MyD88 knockdown experiments, female mice were randomized into two treatment groups and orally administered either
water or 12.5 mg/kg erlotinib daily. For the IL1a neutralization
experiments, male and female mice were randomized into four
treatment groups as follows. Control group: Mice were administered water orally daily and 1 mg/kg IgG intraperitoneally once
per week. Neutralizing IL1a antibody (nIL1aab) group: A human
IL1a neutralizing antibody (XBiotech) was administered intraperitoneally at 100 mg/mouse once per week. Erlotinib group:
Erlotinib was administered orally 12.5 mg/kg daily. Erlotinib þ
nIL1aab group: Erlotinib was administered orally 12.5 mg/kg
daily in addition to nIL1aab administered intraperitoneally at
100 mg/mouse once per week. For experiments involving cetuximab, cetuximab was administered intraperitoneally 0.2 mg
per mouse twice per week and control mice were given IgG twice
per week. All treatments were given for the duration of 3 weeks.
Mice were evaluated daily and tumor measurements taken 3
times per week using Vernier calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: tumor volume ¼ (length  width2)/2
where the length was the longest dimension and width was the
dimension perpendicular to length. Mice were euthanized via
CO2 gas asphyxiation or lethal overdose of sodium pentobarbital
(100 mg/kg) when tumor diameter exceeded 1.5 cm in any
dimension.
Bioinformatics
The Cancer Genome Browser (University of California-Santa
Cruz; https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu) was used to download the
level 3 dataset HNSCC dataset (TCGA_HNSC_exp_HiSeqV2_
PANCAN) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RNAseq data
was normalized across all TCGA cohorts and reported as log2
values. Corresponding level 3 clinical data were available for most
of the 467 samples. Selected tumors (n ¼ 41) also had RNAseq
data for matched normal tissue. Matched tumor and normal
samples were analyzed. Linear fold change was calculated to
emphasize difference between groups. Kaplan–Meier survival
curves were generated by comparing survival of the highest
quartile of expressing tumors (for indicated gene) against the
lowest quartile. In some cases, Kaplan–Meier curves were generated using an aggregate of several genes. The genes aggregated
are as follows: TLR (TLR1,TLR2, TLR4,TLR5,TLR6,TLR7,TLR8,
TLR9,TLR10), IL18R (IL18Ra,IL18Rb), and IL1R (IL1R1,IL1RAP).
Tumors were ranked according to expression of each gene, and
ranks were averaged to determine highest and lowest quartile of
tumors expressing the given receptor family.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism version 5
for Windows (GraphPad Software). Differences between 3 or

www.aacrjournals.org

more means were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey
post tests. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to
estimate and compare the group-speciﬁc change in tumor growth
curves. Differences in survival curves were determined by Mantel–
Cox test. All statistical analysis was performed at the P < 0.05 level
of signiﬁcance.

Results
Erlotinib induces processes involved in inﬂammation
Of the top 10 upregulated cellular process networks identiﬁed by erlotinib treatment, 6 processes were related to immune
response or inﬂammation for both cell lines (Fig. 1A and B).
The top 10 signiﬁcant diseases that were identiﬁed from erlotinib treatment were predominantly systemic inﬂammatory
disorders in both cell lines such as rheumatic diseases/disorders
(rheumatic arthritis, rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease;
Fig. 1C and D). Similarly, the majority of the top 10 upregulated canonical pathways were immune response/inﬂammation related in both cell lines, which included IL6 and IL1
signaling in SQ20B cells (Fig. 2A) and TLR and IL1 signaling in
Cal-27 cells (Fig. 2B).
The top network identiﬁed for SQ20B and Cal-27 was the
NF-kB, MyD88, I-kB, IRAK1/2, NF-kB2 (p100) network
(Fig. 2C) and TRAF6, TAK1 (MAP3K7), NF-kB, I-kB, IKK-g
network (Fig. 2D), respectively. The genes and processes in
these networks were both related to MyD88-dependent TLR
signaling and NF-kB activity (Supplementary Tables S2 and
S3). Altogether, the gene expression analyses suggested that
erlotinib activates inﬂammatory processes and pathways that
may be mediated by MyD88.
Loss of MyD88 increases tumor sensitivity to erlotinib
We have previously shown that erlotinib induces the secretion
of IL6 and other proinﬂammatory cytokines via NF-kB activation
in HNSCC cells (10), which supports the gene expression results
(Figs. 1 and 2). Transient knockdown of MyD88 signiﬁcantly
suppressed baseline and erlotinib-induced IL6 production in
both SQ20B (Fig. 3A) and Cal-27 cells (Fig. 3B). MyD88 stable
knockout clones (shMyD88#2, shMyD88#9) also demonstrated
signiﬁcantly reduced IL6 in the absence and presence of erlotinib
compared with control (Fig. 3C) supporting the role of MyD88dependent signaling in erlotinib-induced IL6 production. Both
MyD88-knockout clones showed reduced tumor growth when
treated with erlotinib compared with erlotinib-treated control
xenografts (Fig. 3D–G). Notably, xenografts bearing the shMyD88
#9 clone showed reduced tumor growth in both treated and
untreated groups (Fig. 3D and G). Altogether these results suggest
that MyD88-dependent signaling is involved in erlotinib-induced
IL6 secretion and suppresses the antitumor activity of erlotinib.
TLR5 signaling may be involved in erlotinib-induced IL6
secretion
A general trend of increased TLR, IL1R, and IL18R RNA expression was found in HNSCC human tumors [obtained from
the Tissue Procurement Core (TPC) in the Department of
Pathology] compared with matched normal tissue (Fig. 4A and
B). Notably, both tumors showed large increases in expression of
TLR2 compared with normal matched tissue (Fig. 4A and B). IL6
secretion was signiﬁcantly increased after treatment with agonists
to TLR1/2, TLR2/6, and TLR3 in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 4C), although

Process network and disease analyses of erlotinib-treated HNSCC cells. Shown are the top 20 upregulated cellular/molecular processes (A and B) and diseases (C
and D) from differentially regulated transcripts comparing microarray data from erlotinib-treated (5 mmol/L, 48 hours) SQ20B (A and C) and Cal-27
(B and D) HNSCC versus DMSO-treated cells.

TLR5 appeared to be active in only SQ20B cells (Fig. 4C). Erlotinib
increased TLR8 expression in SQ20B cells and TLR10 in Cal-27
cells, although the absolute levels of these TLRs were very low and
most likely not of biologic signiﬁcance (Fig. 4D). As the TLR1/2
and TLR2/6 dimers both depend on TLR2, the activity of
these dimers were suppressed using siRNA targeted to TLR2 (Fig.
4E and F). Knockdown of TLR2 expression did not decrease
erlotinib-induced IL6 (Fig. 4E). However, knockdown of TLR5
expression partially but signiﬁcantly suppressed erlotinibinduced IL6 secretion in SQ20B cells (Fig. 4G and H), which was
not observed in Cal-27 cells (data not shown). TLR3, which is
not a MyD88-dependent receptor also, was not involved in
erlotinib-induced IL6 in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Altogether, these results suggest that of the TLRs, only TLR5
signaling may contribute to IL6 secretion induced by erlotinib in
select HNSCC cell lines.
IL1 signaling is critical for erlotinib-induced IL6 expression in
HNSCC cells
To investigate the contribution of other MyD88-dependent
signaling pathways, the IL18R and IL1R pathways were studied.
Neutralization of IL18R in SQ20B (Fig. 4I) and Cal-27 (Fig. 4J)

1660 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

failed to suppress erlotinib-induced IL6. However, anakinra, a
recombinant IL1R antagonist (IL1RA/IL1RN) signiﬁcantly
reduced baseline and erlotinib-induced IL6 in both SQ20B
(Fig. 5A) and Cal-27 (Fig. 5B). In addition, transient (Supplementary Fig. S2) and stable knockdown of IL1R suppressed
erlotinib-induced IL6 (Fig. 5C), suggesting that IL1R signaling
may be involved in erlotinib-induced IL6. Sequenced HNSCC
tumors and matched normal tissue (n ¼ 40) were analyzed
from TCGA for mRNA levels of ligands of the IL1 pathway. IL1a
and IL1b were found to be increased in tumors by 4.8- and 2.5fold, respectively, compared with normal samples while IL1RA/
IL1RN was decreased by 2.5-fold (Fig. 5D). IL1a was also
upregulated in both HNSCC tumors analyzed in Fig. 4A and
B while IL1b was only upregulated in one of these tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S3). IL1a but not IL1b was detectable after
erlotinib treatment and increased across all time points measured in both cell lines (Fig. 5E). Exogenous IL1a increased IL6
secretion in the presence and absence of erlotinib (Fig. 5F) and
blockade of IL1a abut not of IL1b activity signiﬁcantly reduced
IL6 secretion in the absence and presence of erlotinib (Fig. 5G),
suggesting that IL1a release may be responsible for erlotinibinduced IL6 production.

Pathway and network analysis of erlotinib-treated HNSCC cells. Shown are the top 10 upregulated pathways (A and B) and top upregulated
inﬂammation-related networks (C and D) constructed from differentially regulated transcripts comparing microarray data from erlotinib-treated
(5 mmol/L, 48 hours) SQ20B (A and C) and Cal-27 (B and D) HNSCC versus DMSO-treated cells. Upregulated genes are marked with red circles and
downregulated with blue circles. The "checkerboard" color indicates mixed expression for the gene between cell lines.

Erlotinib-induced cell death triggers IL1a release
IL1a unlike IL1b is not secreted but is typically released by
cell death. To conﬁrm this, we showed that Z-VAD-fmk
(ZVAD), a pan-caspase inhibitor, signiﬁcantly reduced baseline and erlotinib-induced levels of IL1a (Fig. 6A) and
blocked erlotinib-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig.
S4), suggesting that IL1a is likely released because of erlotinib-induced cell death. These results were not observed with
the caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-Y-VAD-cho (YVAD, Fig. 6A). Our
laboratory has previously shown that erlotinib induces cell
death via H2O2-mediated oxidative stress due to NOX4 activity
(23). To conﬁrm that oxidative stress is involved in IL1a
release, we showed that the antioxidants NAC and CAT significantly suppressed erlotinib-induced IL1a in addition to IL6 in
both SQ20B (Fig. 6B) and Cal-27 cells (Fig. 6C). We have
previously shown that these antioxidants signiﬁcantly protect
these HNSCC cell lines from erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity
(23). Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative NOX4

www.aacrjournals.org

(N4dn) decreased erlotinib-induced IL1a, IL6 production (Fig.
6D and E) and cytotoxicity (Fig. 6F) in both SQ20B (Fig. 6D
and F) and Cal-27 (Fig. 6E and F). The opposite results were
observed with wild-type NOX4 (N4wt; Fig. 6D–F). The ability
of N4wt (and not N4dn) to signiﬁcantly induce oxidative stress
in these cell lines has been demonstrated in our previous
publications (10, 21). Altogether, these results suggest that
erlotinib-induced oxidative stress (via NOX4) results in cell
death, leading to IL1a release resulting in activation of IL1R
signaling in unaffected/surviving cells leading to IL6 expression
and secretion.
IL1a is negatively correlated with survival in HNSCC
Sequenced HNSCC tumors (TCGA, n ¼ 467) with high
expression of MyD88, TLRs, IL1R, IL18R, IL1a, IL1b, and IL1RA
were plotted for survival against low expressing tumors
(Fig. 7A–H). MyD88, TLRs, IL18R, IL1b, and IL1RA were not
signiﬁcantly correlated with survival (Fig. 7A–C, G, and H).

Figure 3.
Knockdown of MyD88 reduces IL6 and tumor growth in HNSCC cells. SQ20B (A) and Cal-27 (B) cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA control (siCON) or siRNA
targeted against MyD88 (siMyD88). Cells were treated with DMSO (black bars) or erlotinib (ERL; 5 mmol/L; gray bars) for 48 hours and IL6 measured by
ELISA. SQ20B cells were transfected with an shRNA targeted against MyD88 (shMyD88) or a control plasmid (shCON) and selected with zeocin. Clones were
analyzed for MyD88 levels by Western blotting (C, inset) and IL6 in the presence of DMSO and 5 mmol/L erlotinib (C). D–G, above clones were injected into
the right ﬂank of athymic nu/nu mice. Tumor growth was measured over a 3-week treatment period (12.5 mg/kg erlotinib or water daily; D and E). Tumor volume at
day 17 is shown for clone #2 (F) and clone #9 (G). n ¼ 11–13. Error bars, SEM.  , P < 0.05 versus control;   , P < 0.05 versus erlotinib.

High IL1R expressing tumors showed a trend (P ¼ 0.06) toward
a negative correlation with survival (Fig. 7D) while IL1a mRNA
expression was negatively correlated (P ¼ 0.04) with survival
(Fig. 7E). Selected tumors from patients who received targeted
molecular therapy (TMT, n ¼ 40) showed an increased negative
correlation with survival (P ¼ 0.02, Fig. 7F), suggesting that
IL1a expression may be an important prognostic marker in
HNSCC.

1662 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

Finally, we showed that SQ20B cells treated with an IL1a
neutralizing antibody (XBiotech; ref. 24) in combination with
erlotinib displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in survival compared
with the other treatment groups in vitro (Fig. 7I) and in vivo
(Fig. 7J). Similar results were observed with cetuximab in vivo
(Fig. 7K), suggesting that blockade of the IL1 pathway may
increase the sensitivity of erlotinib and other EGFRIs. Altogether,
our results and previous ﬁndings suggest that erlotinib (and

Role of TLR signaling in erlotinib (ERL)-induced IL6 in HNSCC cells. A and B, RNA isolated from two HNSCC tumors [#9 (A) and #13 (B); gray bars] and
matched normal tissue (black bars) was analyzed for TLR1–10, IL1R, and IL18R gene expression by RT-PCR. C, SQ20B, Cal-27, and FaDu cells were treated with TLR
agonists as described in Materials and Methods. Secreted IL6 was measured by ELISA. D, SQ20B and Cal-27 were treated with DMSO or 5 mmol/L erlotinib for 48
hours. Cells were analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of TLR genes. Values were normalized to 18S mRNA levels and reported as fold change over DMSO
(set at 1, dotted line). E–H, SQ20B or Cal-27 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA control (siCON), siRNA targeted against TLR2 (siTLR2; E and F), or siRNA
targeted against TLR5 (siTLR5; G and H), treated with DMSO or 5 mmol/L erlotinib, and then analyzed for IL6. Knockdown of respective TLRs was conﬁrmed
by RT-PCR (F and H). SQ20B (I) and Cal-27 (J) cells were treated with IgG or an IL18R neutralizing antibody (nIL18Rab, 0.5 mg/mL) for 2 hours before DMSO or
erlotinib (5 mmol/L) before IL6 analysis. n¼ 3; errors bars, SEM.  , P < 0.05 versus control;   , P < 0.05 versus erlotinib.

perhaps other EGFRIs) induce cell death via H2O2-mediated
oxidative stress due to NOX4 activity leading to IL1a release and
activation of the IL1R/MyD88/NF-kB signaling axis on surviving tumor cells resulting in IL6 secretion (Fig. 7L). Our results
also propose that another unidentiﬁed DAMP may be released
that activates the TLR5/MyD88/NF-kB signaling axis, resulting
in IL6 secretion. This IL6 signaling is believed to reduce the
antitumor activity of EGFRIs and promote tumor progression
(Fig. 7L).

Discussion
Our laboratory has previously shown that EGFRIs increased IL6
secretion and that IL6 levels played a critical role in the antitumor
effect of erlotinib in vitro and in vivo (10), which has been
supported and studied in depth by other groups (15–18). The
studies presented here now indicate that MyD88-dependent IL1R
signaling is most likely responsible for the IL6 production
induced by EGFRIs. Therefore, targeting IL1 signaling may be a
novel strategy to increase the antitumor efﬁcacy of erlotinib and
other EGFRIs in HNSCC.
We have observed that the majority of cellular processes and
pathways upregulated by erlotinib treatment was related to
immune response and inﬂammation (Figs. 1 and 2). These

observations support one other study showing that the EGFRI
PD153035 upregulated genes related to inﬂammation and
innate immunity (25). Interestingly, the inﬂammatory proﬁle
displayed by erlotinib treatment was remarkably similar to
that of rheumatic diseases and other systemic inﬂammatory
disorders (Fig. 1C and D). In fact, inhibition of the IL1
pathway is a well-documented strategy for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as IL1R ligands (IL1a and IL1b) are
particularly abundant in the synovial lining of the joint (26).
Anakinra is a humanized recombinant IL1R antagonist
(IL1RA) that is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of RA.
IL1RA is an IL1R ligand that inhibits the IL1 pathway through
competition with the other IL1R ligands (27). In support of
this, we have shown that anakinra effectively blocked erlotinib-induced IL6 in HNSCC cell lines (Fig. 5A and B) implying
that IL1 pathway-targeting drugs used for the management of
RA (and other systemic inﬂammatory disorders) could be
investigated as a potential adjuvant to EGFRIs in the treatment
of HNSCC.
Of the ligands in the IL1 family, IL1b is the most well-studied
and its production is dependent on inﬂammasome-mediated
caspase-1 activity (28). In the present studies, we believe
that IL1a and not IL1b is involved in the activation of the
IL1R/MyD88/IL6 pathway by erlotinib, as we were unable to

detect any secreted IL1b and suppression of IL1b using a
neutralizing IL1b antibody or a caspase-1 inhibitor did not
affect erlotinib-induced IL6 (Figs. 4E and G and 6A). On the
other hand, we were able to detect IL1a (Fig. 5E) and suppression of IL1a signiﬁcantly blocked erlotinib-induced IL6 (Fig.
5G), suggesting that IL1a was the ligand responsible for activating the IL1 pathway.
Unlike IL1b, IL1a is not secreted from the cell but is released
during cell death and acts as a DAMP (29). It is likely that the
cell death induced by erlotinib treatment resulted in IL1a
release, as the use of ZVAD blocked erlotinib-induced cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S4) and IL1a release (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, our laboratory has previously shown that erlotinib
induces cell death via H2O2-mediated oxidative stress due to
NOX4 activity (23). We have now extended these ﬁndings to
show that IL1a release in addition to downstream IL6 secretion
is mediated by erlotinib-induced cell death due to NOX4induced oxidative stress (Fig. 6B–F).
Our gene expression analyses also implicated TLR/MyD88
signaling (especially TLR2) as a possible mediator of erlotinibinduced IL6 (Fig. 2); however, we found no evidence of TLR2
involvement despite TLR2 being present and active on HNSCC
tumors and cell lines (Fig. 4A–C). Surprisingly, we found that
TLR2 knockdown increased IL6 secretion (Fig. 4E). An explanation for these results is unclear, although one prior report has
shown that activation of TLR2 resulted in decreased NF-kB activity
via increased miR-329 leading to decreased IL6 expression in
human trophoblast cells (30). Perhaps in our HNSCC cell model,
inhibition of TLR2 expression decreased levels of miR-329 resulting in increased NF-kB and IL6 secretion, which would be con-

1664 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

sistent with the previous ﬁndings in trophoblast cells (30).
Interestingly, TLR5 was active in only SQ20B cells (Fig. 4C) and
TLR5 knockdown partially but signiﬁcantly suppressed erlotinibinduced IL6 production in this cell line only, suggesting that TLR5
activity may be important in select HNSCC cell lines (Fig. 4G and
H). At this time, endogenous DAMPs capable of activation of
TLR5 are unknown; therefore, we are unclear as to how erlotinib
induces TLR5.
Given that IL1a appears to be the ligand that triggers the
IL1R/MyD88/IL6 cascade that we believe is responsible for
poor response to EGFRIs, then in theory, neutralization of IL1a
should increase the antitumor efﬁcacy of EGFRIs in the same
manner as blockade of IL6 as previously shown by our laboratory (10, 15–18). Indeed we observed that IL1a neutralization signiﬁcantly increased the antitumor efﬁcacy of erlotinib
(Fig. 7J) in addition to cetuximab (Fig. 7K) in SQ20B cells.
These exciting results suggest that IL1a plays an important role
in response to EGFRIs. Moreover, we want to highlight that the
observed effects of erlotinib in our studies are believed to be
directly due to cell death mediated by EGFR inhibition and not
due to off-target effects of the drugs as (i) we are using clinical
achievable doses (31) and (ii) we have already conﬁrmed the
ability of EGFR knockdown (using siRNA targeted to EGFR) to
induce oxidative stress, cell death, and cytokine secretion
(10, 23).
To further stress the importance of IL1a in the management
of HNSCC, we found that HNSCC tumors expressed high
levels of IL1a compared with matched normal tissue (Fig.
5D) and high IL1a-expressing tumors have worse prognosis
than low IL1a-expressing tumors (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, when

MyD88-Dependent Signaling in EGFR-Targeted Therapy

Erlotinib (ERL) increases IL1a secretion via oxidative stress–mediated cell death. A, SQ20B and Cal-27 cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk (ZVAD) or
Y-VAD-fmk (YVAD) for 1 hour before 48-hour DMSO or 5 mmol/L erlotinib and then analyzed for IL1a by ELISA. SQ20B (B) and Cal-27 (C) cells were pretreated with
20 mmol/L NAC or 100 U/mL PEGylated CAT for 1 hour before treatment with erlotinib and then analyzed for IL1a and IL6 secretion by ELISA. D–F, SQ20B
(D) and Cal-27 (E) were transfected with empty (EMP), N4wt, or dominant-negative NOX4 (N4dn) adenoviral vectors before treatment with DMSO or erlotinib and
then analyzed for IL1a and IL6 secretion by ELISA (D and E) and clonogenic survival (F). n ¼ 3; errors bars, SEM.  , P < 0.05 versus control;   , P < 0.05

we selected for tumors from patients receiving TMT, we found
an increased separation and signiﬁcance between the survival
curves (Fig. 7F), suggesting that IL1a expression may not only
predict overall survival in HNSCC but also predict response to
TMT. Unfortunately, the clinical information associated with
the tumors from patients that received TMT did not reveal what
treatment regimen was administered; therefore, we cannot
make ﬁrm conclusions from this analysis. However, as the only
TMT currently used in HNSCC is EGFR-targeting drugs and the
only approved EGFRI for HNSCC to date is cetuximab, it is
more likely than not that the TMT involved cetuximab in our
analysis.
Suppression of MyD88 effectively blocked erlotinib-induced
IL6 production and suppressed tumor growth in the presence
of erlotinib (Fig. 3), which is likely due to the ability of
MyD88 knockdown to block all potential proinﬂammatory
signaling from MyD88-dependent receptors. It is unclear why
control-treated shMyD88 #9 tumors displayed such a pronounced inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 3E) compared with
control-treated shMyD88 #2 tumors (Fig. 3D). Previous
reports have shown that MyD88 signaling may induce EGFR
ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG),
resulting in the activation of EGFR (32). Perhaps knockdown
of MyD88 expression in the shMyD88 #9 clone led to the
inhibition of EGFR via downregulation of AREG/EREG in
addition to suppression of IL6, which may explain our observations. Nevertheless, these results suggest that MyD88 inhi-

www.aacrjournals.org

bition may also be a promising strategy to increase the effect of
erlotinib.
It should be noted that global inhibition of MyD88, IL1a, or
any factor in the IL1R/MyD88/IL6 signaling axis in vivo may have
unexpected results. Our model takes into account only the activity
of MyD88 or IL1a within cancer cells. Inhibition of these inﬂammatory components in innate immune cells may change the
inﬂammatory microenvironment especially in an immunocompetent mouse model, conceivably altering recruitment of immune
cells and unpredictably altering growth of the tumor. This remains
to be studied.
On the basis of these ﬁndings and our prior studies
(10, 21, 23), we propose a model in which EGFR inhibition
causes cell death and release of IL1a, which we believe binds its
receptor IL1R on surviving cells, activates MyD88, and induces
IL6 secretion via NF-kB (Fig. 7L). IL6 signaling pathways
typically lead to phosphorylation of STAT3, which is well
known to compensating for the loss of EGFR signaling due to
cross-talk (33). As such, we believe that the poor response and
possibly acquired resistance to erlotinib in the clinical setting
may be due to IL1R/MyD88/IL6 signaling triggered by release
of IL1a from dying cells, which is different from other proposed
mechanisms of poor response/acquired resistance (acquired
mutations, alternative signaling pathways; refs. 6–9). To our
knowledge, the studies presented here are the ﬁrst to connect
IL1a and MyD88-dependent signaling with response to EGFRtargeted therapy and this novel mechanism may offer insight
