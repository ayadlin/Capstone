BACKGROUND: This study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine given concurrently with
preoperative, fixed-dose external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for patients with resectable, high-risk extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcoma (STS). METHODS: Gemcitabine was administered on days 1, 8, 22, 29, 43, and 50 with EBRT (50 Gy in 25 fractions over
5 weeks). The gemcitabine MTD was determined with a toxicity severity weight method (TSWM) incorporating 6 toxicity types. The
TSWM is a Bayesian procedure that choses each cohort’s dose to have a posterior mean total toxicity burden closest to a predetermined clinician-defined target. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were also collected. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients completed the
study. According to the TSWM, the gemcitabine MTD was 700 mg/m2. At this dose level, 4 patients (24%) experienced grade 4 toxicity; no toxicity-related deaths occurred. All tumors were resected with microscopically negative margins. Pathologic responses of
>90% tumor necrosis were achieved in 17 patients (47%); 14 (39%) had complete responses. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years,
the 5-year locoregional recurrence–free survival, distant metastasis–free survival, and overall survival rates were 85%, 80%, and 86%,
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TSWM combines data from qualitatively different toxicities and can be used to determine the MTD
for a drug given as part of a multimodality treatment. Neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus radiation therapy is feasible and safe in patients
with high-risk extremity and trunk STS. Major pathologic responses can be achieved, and after complete resection, long-term clinical

INTRODUCTION
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) accounts for only 1% of adult solid tumors1; however, in affected patients, these tumors can often cause significant morbidity and death. Although STS can develop anywhere in the body, the majority of tumors
(70%) occur in the extremities or trunk. In patients with small (T1 or  5 cm) and low-grade tumors, surgical resection
alone typically provides sufficient disease control; however, in patients with large (T2 or >5 cm) or intermediate- to highgrade tumors, multimodality treatment is critical because these tumors have a high risk for both locoregional and distant
recurrence after surgical resection alone. Several options for multimodality treatment are available, but the optimal regimen and the appropriate sequence of treatments are currently unresolved.
Gemcitabine is an antimetabolite drug often used in combination with docetaxel as second-line systemic therapy
against advanced STS.2,3 When used as a single agent, gemcitabine has a reported objective response rate of 8% to 18%4,5;
for leiomyosarcoma specifically, the rate is 14% to 19%.6 Gemcitabine, both as a single agent and in combination with
docetaxel, also appears to have activity against malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which is now known as undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma.5 In addition, gemcitabine has potent radiosensitizing properties7; in fact, favorable clinical

outcomes with gemcitabine plus radiation therapy have
been reported for patients with advanced head and neck,
pancreatic, and lung cancers.7-10 Preclinical data from cell
lines and xenograft models also suggest that gemcitabine
may have efficacy as a radiosensitizer, specifically for
STS.11,12
For localized, high-risk solid tumors, our institution
has had a longstanding interest in preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy, which offers several advantages, including
the ability to monitor the primary tumor response in vivo
and control potential sites of locoregional and distant microscopic disease upfront.13,14 The safety and efficacy of
neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus radiation therapy in
patients with STS is unknown. We performed a phase 1
trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
gemcitabine combined with radiation therapy in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with high-risk extremity or
trunk STS. To determine the MTD of gemcitabine, we
used a novel, sequentially adaptive dose-finding method
that incorporated multiple toxicity types with assigned severity weights15 rather than a traditional phase 1 trial
design, which characterizes toxicity as a single binary variable. Clinicopathologic and long-term outcome data for
our study patients were also analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
before their enrollment in the trial and receipt of treatment. This study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02046304).
To be eligible for the trial, patients had to have resectable (measurable or nonmeasurable), grade 2 or 3 (intermediate- to high-grade) STS of an extremity or trunk
with histologic verification at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center. At the time of study enrollment, patients were also required to have a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1, an absolute neutrophil
count > 1500 cells/lL, a platelet count  100,000/mL, a
3660

serum creatinine level  1.8 mg/dL, liver transaminase
levels  3 times the upper limit of normal, and a total bilirubin level  1.5 mg/dL. Patients were excluded if they
had received prior radiation therapy in the area of the primary tumor or if the anticipated radiation field would
have included the perineum, scrotum, or vaginal introitus.
Prior systemic chemotherapy was allowed with a washout
period of at least 3 weeks and confirmed normal blood
counts before enrollment in the study.
Study patients received neoadjuvant gemcitabine
(Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) at doses ranging from 400 to 700 mg/m2 in combination with fixeddose external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for a total
dose of 50 Gy (Fig. 1). Gemcitabine was given as an intravenous infusion of 10 mg/m2/min at the assigned dose on
days 1, 8, 22, 29, 43, and 50. Radiation therapy was given
in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. When given on the same
day, gemcitabine was administered 4 hours before radiation therapy. All of the patients were treated with 3dimensional conformal planning with computer tomography–based simulation and 3-dimensional computer
planning. No effort was made to spare the skin. The gross
tumor volume was treated with a 2-cm radial margin and
a 5-cm proximal and distal margin. Four to 6 weeks after
the last dose of gemcitabine, patients underwent complete
surgical resection of their primary tumor. Patients with
microscopically positive margins underwent re-resection
to achieve negative margins. Representative sections of
resected tumors were prepared with standard hematoxylin
and eosin staining. The percentage of tumor necrosis for
each case was then scored by an experienced soft tissue pathologist, who was blinded to the details of the patient’s
study treatment.
The gemcitabine dose for each successive patient
cohort was determined with the sequentially adaptive
Bayesian toxicity severity weight method (TSWM) of
Bekele and Thall.15 This method bases dose selection on
the total toxicity burden (TTB). To compute TTB, before
a trial, each grade of each type of toxicity is assigned a severity weight based on its relative clinical importance

(Table 1); this quantifies the oncologists’ experiences in
dealing with multiple toxicities in the clinic. The observed
TTB of a patient is defined as the sum of the weights of all
toxicities experienced by the patient. The mean TTB of
each dose is defined as the probability-weighted average of
all severities of all grades of all toxicities. The scientific goal
of the trial is to estimate these probabilities on the basis of
the observed dose toxicity data, and the clinical goal is to
determine the “best” dose according to the mean TTB. To
do this, when the trial is being designed, one determines a
target TTB by showing the clinicians a set of toxicity combinations and, for each combination, asking whether they
would escalate, repeat the previous dose, or de-escalate for
the next cohort. The mean of the TTBs of the combinations for which the answer is “repeat” is used as the target
TTB in the trial. During the conduct of the trial, each successive patient cohort is treated with the “best” dose having
a posterior mean TTB under the Bayesian model closest to
the numerical target TTB. In the gemcitabine trial, the target TTB was 3.04. Six gemcitabine-related toxicity types
were continually assessed up to 6 weeks for each patient to
provide the basis for the TSWM dose-finding algorithm.
To our knowledge, this was the first phase 1 trial to use the
TTB-based dose-finding method of Bekele and Thall. The
idea of TTB and related methods have been discussed in
Designs for Clinical Trials: Perspectives on Current Issues16
and by Ezzalfani et al.17
Locoregional recurrence–free survival and distant metastasis–free survival were measured from the date of surgery
to the date of locoregional and distant recurrence, respectively. Overall survival was measured from the date of surgery
to the date of death. Unadjusted event time distributions
were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.18

Comparisons between patient groups were made
with the log-rank test.19 A Bayesian multivariate regression model20 was fitted for TTB under the assumption
that each time-to-event variable followed a parametric distribution. All statistical analyses were conducted in R
3.0.2 with the following R packages: MASS (version 7.329), lattice (version 0.20-29), survival (version 2.37-7),
R2WinBUGS (version 2.1-19), and BRugs (version 0.83).21 For frequentist tests, a P value < .05 was considered
significant. For Bayesian inferences, posterior probabilities of Pr(b > 0|data) > 0.95 and Pr(b > 0|data) > 0.99
may be considered to show significant and highly significant positive associations of the covariate with the
response, respectively. Values < 0.05 and < 0.01 correspond to significant and highly significant negative associations of the covariate with the response, respectively.
Values near 0.50 correspond to no association with
response.
RESULTS
Forty-one patients were enrolled in our study; 36 (88%)
completed the study and had evaluable data. Among those
who did not complete the study, 1 patient dropped out
because of toxicity, and the remaining patients withdrew
consent for nontoxicity reasons.
Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics are
summarized (Table 2). The study patients were relatively
young, and the majority had primary disease of the lower
extremity. Although most tumors were large (T2 or
>5 cm), 5 patients (14%) did have a tumor size of 0.
These patients, enrolled for toxicity assessment, had
undergone prestudy resection with microscopically positive margins and then received neoadjuvant gemcitabine
and EBRT followed by resection to negative margins. The
most common histology was undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma, which was followed by myxoid liposarcoma. In the latter group, 2 of 7 patients had
round cell transformation.
The most common toxicities observed during the
study were myelosuppression without fever (17 patients
or 47%), dermatitis (12 patients or 33%), and hepatitis
(10 patients or 28%; Table 3). These toxicities were
mostly grade 3. Only 3 patients (8%) developed toxicities
assigned the highest severity weight of 6.0 (most clinical
importance); all had grade 4 dermatitis. No patients
developed grade 4 myelosuppression with fever or grade
4 hepatitis. No deaths occurred as a result of treatment
toxicity during the course of the study.
Using the TSWM, we determined that the MTD of
gemcitabine when it was given with 50 Gy of EBRT was
3661

Original Article

700 mg/m2. At this dose level, the majority of observed
toxicities were grade 3 or lower, and only 4 of 17 patients
(24%) experienced grade 4 toxicities (2 had myelosuppression without fever, and 2 had dermatitis; Table 3). In
general, higher TTBs were observed in patients who had
received gemcitabine at 700 mg/m2 versus those in the
lower dose cohorts (Fig. 2). In fact, according to regression modeling, a gemcitabine dose of 700 mg/m2 was the
only covariate that was significantly associated with a
higher TTB (Table 4). Patient age, tumor size, tumor
grade, receipt of prestudy chemotherapy, and tumor location (upper extremity vs lower extremity vs trunk) did not
appear to affect TTB.
All 36 patients who completed neoadjuvant gemcitabine and EBRT were able to undergo complete tumor
resection with microscopically negative margins. All resections consisted of a wide local excision, and no patients
required amputation. In collaboration with plastic and
reconstructive surgeons, wound closure consisted of skin
grafting and/or rotational or free flap coverage in 20
patients (56%); the remaining patients had a simple primary closure. Only 2 patients (6% of all patients), both
with lower extremity tumors in the 700 mg/m2 cohort
(2 of 17 or 12%), developed major postoperative wound
complications (seroma requiring percutaneous drainage
catheter placement and seroma and wound infection
requiring hospitalization). Neither of these patients
required reoperation for their wound complications.
Eleven additional patients (31%) had minor wound complications that did not require procedural intervention or
hospitalization. The majority of patients (23 or 64%) had
no wound complications.

mens of 17 patients (47%). Fourteen of these patients
(82% or 39% of all patients) experienced a complete pathologic response, which was defined as 95% tumor necrosis. A scatterplot of the degree of necrosis versus the
tumor size is shown (Fig. 3). Pre- and posttherapy histology images from 2 representative cases are shown (Fig. 4).
The occurrence of a major pathologic response was not
associated with the gemcitabine dose and was observed at
all dose levels (Table 5). With a median follow-up of 6.2
years, the 5-year locoregional recurrence–free survival rate
was 85%, the distant metastasis–free survival rate was
80%, and the overall survival rate was 86% (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
For patients with high-risk extremity and trunk STS, multimodality therapy is critical for adequate locoregional
and distant disease control. To our knowledge, the combination of gemcitabine and EBRT has never previously
been evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting for patients
with high-risk STS. In the current phase 1 trial, we determined that the MTD for gemcitabine is 700 mg/m2 when

it is given concurrently with fixed-dose (50-Gy) EBRT as
neoadjuvant therapy. At this dose level, the toxicity profile
and the major wound complication rate are acceptable.
The determination of MTD in our study was
achieved through the use of a novel, adaptive dose-finding
method: the TSWM. We believe that this method accurately reflects clinical decision making during the conduct
of a phase 1 trial. The TSWM acknowledges the fact that
not all toxicities have equal clinical importance and that
patients may experience more than 1 toxicity during the
study period. Data from several qualitatively different toxicities are combined to determine the MTD. Since the
technique’s initial statistical description in 2004,15 several
other groups have proposed similar methods for toxicity
assessment in phase 1 trials. Yuan et al22 transformed toxicity grades into a numerical score and incorporated this
into a continual reassessment method. Chen et al23
devised a normalized equivalent toxicity score that also
uses a subjective ranking of toxicity grades but includes
additional toxicities as a decimal portion of the overall
score. Lee et al24 reported a toxicity burden score similar
to our description. Ezzalfani et al17 used a Euclidean
norm of toxicity weights rather than an arithmetic sum to
define a total toxicity profile. All of these methods, including the TSWM, require close collaboration between clinicians and statisticians with the specification of which
toxicities are relevant to a given trial and group of patients
and the predetermination of an acceptable target for total
toxicity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to prospectively implement the TSWM in an actual clinical trial

and, moreover, to use the TSWM for the determination
of the MTD of a drug given as part of a multimodality
treatment.
The TSWM does come with important caveats. First,
it is a relatively labor-intensive design in comparison with
traditional dose-finding methods and, therefore, may not
appeal to some clinicians. Second, the TSWM applied in
this trial did not incorporate less severe toxicities (grade 1
or 2; subdose-limiting), which can still be clinically significant and affect dose escalation (eg, as an indicator of a
higher probability of experiencing subsequent doselimiting toxicity). Assigning these lower severity weights
and including them in the TTB, however, is straightforward. Third, our TTB definition did not account for the
duration or reversibility of a given toxicity. Fourth, late toxicities were not assessed in the TSWM (this is particularly
relevant for combination treatment strategies that include
radiation therapy). Nonetheless, we feel that the TSWM is
a useful tool and is much more clinically relevant than the
traditional MTD determinations based on a binary toxicity
indicator and used in most phase 1 trials.
Although the primary objective of our study was toxicity assessment and MTD determination, we also analyzed clinical outcomes, including the tumor response.
Histologic examination of resected tumors demonstrated
that almost half of the study patients (47%) had a major
pathologic response. Moreover, a complete pathologic
response, defined as 95% tumor necrosis, was observed
in 39% of the study patients. These results compare very
favorably with reported complete pathologic response

rates with radiation therapy alone (8%-10%) and with the
combination of doxorubicin and radiation therapy (9%14%).25-28 Similar complete pathologic response rates
have been reported previously with neoadjuvant doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and radiation therapy (48%) and, more
recently, with neoadjuvant sorafenib either with radiation
therapy alone (38%) or in combination with chemoradiation (44%).27,29,30 A complete pathologic response in
STS has been shown to be significantly associated with
improved distant recurrence–free survival,26 but to our
knowledge, it has not been reported for progression-free
or overall survival.
In the current study, patients with a smaller tumor
size did appear to have a better response to neoadjuvant
gemcitabine and EBRT (Fig. 3 and Table 5). According
to histology, however, the distribution of patients with
myxoid liposarcoma, a typically radiosensitive subtype,
and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, a typically
nonradiosensitive subtype, appeared to be relatively balanced between responders and nonresponders (Fig. 3).
It is important to note that in the current study,
although patients with prior radiation therapy were
excluded, the enrolled patients frequently received systemic chemotherapy before our study therapy (23 patients
or 64%). The majority of these patients received a
doxorubicin-based regimen (Table 6). The receipt of prior
systemic chemotherapy was not associated with higher
toxicity from our neoadjuvant therapy regimen (Table 4)
but was associated with a greater pathologic response (Table 5). Although age alone was not associated with a path3666

ologic response, interestingly, older patients who received
preoperative chemotherapy on average had a higher
response rate. Seven patients (19%) also received further
chemotherapy off study for disease progression (Table 7).
In summary, the current phase 1 trial demonstrates
that a TSWM incorporating multiple toxicity types is a
useful method to help guide the determination of the
MTD for a drug given as part of a multimodality treatment. Gemcitabine combined with EBRT in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable, high-risk
extremity and trunk STS appears to be feasible and safe
with an MTD of 700 mg/m2. Major pathologic responses,
including complete responses, can be achieved in a substantial proportion of patients. After complete surgical
resection, locoregional and distant disease control rates as
well as overall survival are encouraging (5-year locoregional recurrence–free survival, distant metastasis–free
survival, and overall survival > 80%). Further evaluation
of this treatment’s efficacy in a phase 2 trial is definitely
warranted.
