ABSTRACT
Because colorectal cancer (CRC) stem-like cells (CCS-like cells) contribute to
poor patient prognosis, these cells are a potential target for CRC therapy. However,
the mechanism underlying the maintenance of CCS-like cell properties remains
unclear. Here, we found that patients with advanced stage CRC expressed high levels
of polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). High expression of
EZH2 in tumor tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Conversely, silencing
EZH2 reduced CRC cell proliferation. Surprisingly, EZH2 was more highly expressed
in the CCS-like cell subpopulation than in the non-CCS-like cell subpopulation. EZH2
knockdown significantly reduced the CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation, suppressed
mammosphere formation, and decreased the expression of self-renewal-related genes
and strongly impaired tumor-initiating capacity in a re-implantation mouse model.
Gene expression data from 433 human CRC specimens from TCGA database and in
vitro results revealed that EZH2 helped maintain CCS-like cell properties by activating
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We further revealed that p21cip1–mediated arrest of the
cell cycle at G1/S phase is required for EZH2 activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Moreover, the specific EZH2 inhibitor EPZ-6438, a clinical trial drug, prevented CRC
progression. Collectively, these findings revealed EZH2 maintaining CCS-like cell
characteristics by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/S phase. These results indicate a
new approach to CRC therapy.

like cells) in the primary tumor possess the abilities to
self-renew and differentiate [12]. CS-like cells promote
tumorigenesis, recurrence and metastasis [13]. The 5-year
survival rate was significantly higher in cancer cases with
a low percentage of CCS-like cells (below 5%) than in
those with a higher percentage of CCS-like cells [14].
Dysregulation of developmental pathway members,
including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and transforming
growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein,
contributes to the maintenance of CS-like cell properties
[15, 16]. Aberrant Wnt signaling pathway activation
predicts poor CRC patient prognosis [17]. Wnt cascade
activity is a critical regulator maintaining CCS-like cell
properties [18]. The mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
commonly diagnosed cancers, and 1.23 million patients
are diagnosed with CRC each year worldwide [1]. Despite
recent advances in chemotherapies that have improved
survival rates, patients with late-stage disease still have
a poor prognosis, and the overall mortality rate of CRC
is approximately 40% [2–5]. Therefore, new effective
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed [6].
CRC stem-like cells (CCS-like cells) have recently
attracted increased attention due to their contribution to
the poor prognosis of cancer patients [7–11]. Emerging
evidence has suggested that cancer stem-like cells (CS-

21]. However, the critical activator of the Wnt signaling
pathway in CCS-like cells is largely unknown.
Epigenetic regulation by polycomb proteins is an
essential factor in the poor prognosis of cancer patients
[22, 23]. High expression of polycomb group protein
enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a key component
of the polycomb PRC2 complex, links to aggressive
cancer progression [24, 25]. EZH2 has been shown
to be overexpressed in cancers [22]. Moreover, EZH2
expression is associated with a high proliferation rate and
aggressive tumor subtypes of cancer [26]. However, the
function of EZH2 in maintaining CCS-like cell properties
is unknown.
Recent studies have shown that cell cycle inhibitor
gene expression is involved in attenuating CS-like cell
capabilities [27–29]. Interestingly, decreasing EZH2
expression has been shown to arrest Temozolomideresistant glioblastoma cells at the G1/S phase [30, 31].
Additionally, genetic reducing EZH2 expression has
been shown to increase the expression of the cell cycle
inhibitor p21cip1 (also referred to as p21waf1) in embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma [32–35]. However, the role of p21cip1
in reducing the CS-like cell population is controversial.
Studies have suggested that p21cip1 expression promoted
tumor regression and poor prognosis in 112 cancer patients
[36, 37], but other studies reported that p21cip1 expression
reduces stem cell properties [38, 39]. Notably, increased
p21 signaling in CRC inactivates the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway [40]. Thus, it is important to study the function
of p21cip1 in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
by EZH2.
In this study, we demonstrated that EZH2 promotes
CS-like cell properties in CRC and further clarified the
mechanism by which EZH2 expression activates Wnt/βcatenin signaling in CRC. Moreover, we revealed that
pharmacologically disrupting EZH2 using the clinical trial
drug EPZ-6438 prevented CRC progression.

1C right panel). These data suggested that EZH2 acts as a
predictive marker for CRC prognosis.

EZH2 promoted CRC cell proliferation and
clonogenicity
To explore the potential role of EZH2 in CRC
progression, we first investigated EZH2 expression in
CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620 and LoVo) with varying
proliferative abilities [41] by western blot and qRT-PCR
analyses. EZH2 expression was higher in SW480 and
SW620 cells, which have higher proliferation capacities
than LoVo cells (Figure 2A). Additionally, the EZH2
transcription levels were higher in SW480 and SW620
cells than in LoVo cells (Figure 2B). We knocked down
EZH2 expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in
SW480 and SW620 cells and performed western blotting
to validate the knockdown efficiency. As depicted in
the right top panels of Figure 2C and Figure 2D, EZH2
expression in SW480 and SW620 cells was nearly
abolished by shEZH2 transfection. We determined cell
viability at the indicated time points using a CCK-8 assay.
Compared to the wild type (WT) and control groups,
the shEZH2-transfected group displayed significantly
decreased viability of SW480 cells (Figure 2C) and
SW620 cells (Figure 2D). Moreover, we confirmed a
significant time-dependent inhibition of SW480 and
SW620 cell proliferation by shEZH2 transfection using
a cell counting assay (Figure S1A-S1B). To further verify
the inhibitory effect of shEZH2 on CRC cell growth,
we performed colony formation assays after shRNA
transfection (Figure 2E). Silencing EZH2 significantly
reduced the number of colonies from 660.3 ± 114.7 of
the WT cells and 723.3 ± 126.5 of the control cells to
174.0 ± 48.1 of the shEZH2-transfected cells in SW480
cells (Figure 2F left panel) and from 772.6 ± 95.3 of the
WT cells and 720.7 ± 53.0 of the control cells to 119.7
± 51.8 of the shEZH2-transfected cells in SW620 cells
(Figure 2F right panel). Conversely, we overexpressed
EZH2 in LoVo cells, which express low level of EZH2
(Figure 2G right panel). The CCK-8 assay showed that
EZH2-overexpressing (OEEZH2) cells possessed greater
viability than WT cells and scramble-transfected control
cells (Control) (Figure 2G left panel). The colony number
was significantly higher in OEEZH2 cells than in WT and
control cells (Figure 2H). These results demonstrated that
EZH2 promotes CRC cell proliferation.

RESULTS
EZH2 acted as a predictive marker for CRC
prognosis
To identify the relationship between EZH2
expression and CRC patient prognosis, we analyzed
81 CRC specimens via immunohistochemical staining
(Table 1). EZH2 expression was substantially higher
in CRC samples than in normal colon tissue samples
(p<0.01), and EZH2 expression gradually increased with
increasing pathological stage (from stage I to stage IV,
p<0.05) (Figure 1A-1B). Notably, according to KaplanMeier analysis, patients with high EZH2 expression
experienced poorer overall survival (OS) than those with
low EZH2 expression in early stage (I and II) (Figure 1C
left panel) and advanced stage (III and IV) tumors (Figure

EZH2 expression increased in CCS-like cell
subpopulation
The CCS-like cell subpopulation has been reported
to play a critical role in tumor growth and progression,
both of which contribute to poor prognosis [7, 8, 10, 11,
42]. Given that EZH2 expression is increased in advanced
carcinomas and that EZH2 expression is essential for CRC

cell growth, we hypothesized that EZH2 is differentially
expressed between CS-like cells and non-CS-like cells.
Previous studies have suggested that undifferentiated
tumorigenic CD133+ and CD44+ cells possessed
CCS-like cell properties [43, 44]. Here, we sorted the
CD133+/CD44+ and CD133-/CD44- subpopulations
by flow cytometry (Figure 3A left panel). The EZH2
mRNA level was significantly increased in the CD133+/
CD44+ subpopulation compared to the CD133-/CD44subpopulation (p<0.05) (Figure 3A right panel). Moreover,
the EZH2 protein levels were higher in CD133+/CD44+
cells than in CD133-/CD44- cells (Figure 3B-3C). We next
performed mammosphere formation assay to test the selfrenewal capacity of cells, which is a pivotal property of
CS-like cells in vitro [45, 46]. We compared EZH2 mRNA
expression between adherent SW480 cells and SW480

mammospheres. Indeed, the EZH2 mRNA level was >2.0fold higher in mammosphere cells compared to adherent
cells (Figure 3D). These findings demonstrated that EZH2
expression is higher in CCS-like cells than in non-CCSlike cells.

EZH2 was indispensable for CCS-like cell
maintenance in vitro
Because CCS-like cells preferentially expressed
EZH2, we speculated that EZH2 expression plays an
essential role in maintaining CCS-like cell properties.
After shEZH2 transfection, we cultured SW480 cells
in serum-free sphere formation medium (Figure 4A).
EZH2-silenced cells exhibited significantly reduced

p<0.05) (Figure 4B left panel), and fewer mammospheres
(~50%, p<0.05) (Figure 4B right panel) compared to WT
or control cells.
To further establish whether EZH2 knockdown
reduced the CCS-like cell population, we performed
flow cytometry to analyze the percentage of cells in the
CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation. As shown in Figure 4C,
~40% of WT and control SW480 cells were members
of the CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation. Upon EZH2
knockdown, the CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation of SW480
cells dramatically decreased from 42.8 ± 0.8% of the WT
cells and 43.3 ± 1.1% of the control cells to 20.5 ± 0.5%
of the shEZH2-transfected cells (p<0.05) (Figure 4D).

Additionally, the expression of self-renewal genes such as
Nanog and Sox2 were decreased in shEZH2-transfected
cells compared to WT and control SW480 cells (Figure
4E). In contrast, the expression of the differentiation
marker Keratin 20 [47] was markedly increased by EZH2
knockdown (Figure 4E).
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is essential for CCSlike cell maintenance [18]. Therefore, gene expression
data from 433 human CRC specimens in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to analyze the
mRNA expression levels of EZH2 relative to the levels
of randomly chosen target genes in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway (http://web.stanford.edu/group/nusselab/cgi-

bin/wnt/target_genes) (Figure 4F-a). The expression of a
Wnt signature, based on the combined mRNA expression
of all 12 Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes, positively
correlated with EZH2 mRNA expression (Figure 4F-b left
panel). Statistical analysis revealed that EZH2 expression
significantly positively correlated with 11 of the 12 Wnt/
β-catenin pathway target genes (Figure 4F-b right panel).
We therefore examined whether EZH2 participates in
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in CRC cell lines
in vitro. Compared to WT and control cells, EZH2silenced cells displayed decreased β-catenin expression
(Figure 4G). Moreover, EZH2 knockdown decreased the
expression of c-Myc and vimentin (Figure 4G), which
are known downstream target genes of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway [48]. We observed similar results in SW620 cells
(Figure S2).

Conversely, after overexpressing the EZH2 protein
in LoVo cells, sphere formation was examined, and
represented images are presented in Figure S3A. The
diameter and number of spheres in the OEEZH2 group
were greater than those in the WT and scramble sequencetransfected (control) groups (Figure S3B). Although
LoVo cells rarely expressed CD133+ [49], the CD44+
cell population was significantly increased in OEEZH2
cells compared with WT and control cells (Figure S3CS3D). Additionally, the expression levels of Nanog and
Sox2 were increased, and Keratin 20 were decreased in
OEEZH2 cells compared to WT and control LoVo cells
(Figure S3E). The β-catenin, c-Myc and vimentin levels
were increased following EZH2 overexpression (Figure
S3F). These results showed that the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway was activated by EZH2. Collectively, these

were allowed to form for 42 days (Figure 5A). The tumors
from the shEZH2 group were significantly smaller than
those from the WT and control groups (Figure 5B).
Consistently, the tumor weight was lower in the shEZH2
group than in the WT and control groups (Figure 5C).
To further demonstrate that EZH2 knockdown
reduces tumor-initiating capacity in vivo, we performed
a functional in vivo assay by re-implanting cells from
primary tumors into secondary nude mice. This assay is a
direct assessment of the tumor-initiating and self-renewal
capacities of CCS-like cells [50]. We subcutaneously
injected 1×102, 1×103, 1×104, 1×105, or 5×106 tumor cells

EZH2 knockdown suppressed tumorigenesis and
tumor-initiating capacity in vivo
As EZH2 is important for maintaining CCS-like cell
properties in vitro, we further evaluated whether EZH2 is
involved in vivo tumorigenicity using a tumor xenograft
model. We subcutaneously inoculated 5×106 WT, control
or shEZH2 SW480 cells into mice, and primary tumors

isolated from primary xenografts of the WT, control or
EZH2 knockdown group into secondary nude mice.
As shown in Figure 5D, cells from shEZH2-transfected
primary tumors showed a 30% reduction in tumorigenesis
compared to cells from WT or control-transfected primary
tumors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that
silencing EZH2 reduced CCS-like cell properties.

which indicated G1/S phase arrest. P21cip1 is a cell cycle
regulator that can arrest cell cycle progression at the G1/S
phase [32]. We found that p21cip1 expression was increased
following EZH2 knockdown (Figure 7C). Consistent with
WT SW480 cells, the CD133+/CD44+ population showed
reduced β-catenin, c-Myc and vimentin expression
after knockdown EZH2, indicating that silencing EZH2
inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 7C).
EPZ-6438 is a specific inhibitor of EZH2 [53]. Similar
to shEZH2 transfection, EPZ-6438 treatment increased
p21cip1 expression and inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway (Figure 7D).
Interestingly, upon siRNA-mediated p21cip1
knockdown in EZH2-silenced SW480 cells, the expression
levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and vimentin were rescued
compared with EZH2 knockdown alone (Figure 7E).
Moreover, the cell cycle was analyzed in the CD133+/
CD44+ population of SW480 cells in which EZH2 and
p21cip1 were simultaneously knocked down (Figure 7F).
G1/S arrest was rescued by p21cip1 knockdown (Figure 7G).
These results established that EZH2 knockdown inactivates
the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by increasing p21cip1
expression, resulting in G1/S phase arrest.

EZH2 knockdown induced CCS-like cell
apoptosis
Previous studies suggested that CS-like cell
properties are often suppressed due to apoptosis of CSlike cells [51] or differentiation from CS-like cells into
non-CS-like cells [52]. We knocked down EZH2 in
CD133+/CD44+ SW480 cells and performed colony
formation assays to evaluate CCS-like cell proliferation
(Figure 6A). The results showed that EZH2 knockdown
reduced the number (164.0 ± 32.0) (Figure 6B) and
size (0.5 ± 0.1 mm3) (Figure 6C) of CD133+/CD44+ cell
colonies compared with non-treatment (438.3 ± 9.5 for
colony number and 2.1 ± 0.6 mm3 for colony size) and
control transfection (430.3 ± 19.6 for colony number and
2.3 ± 0.8 mm3 for colony size) (p<0.05). Consistently,
CCK-8 assays showed that CD133+/CD44+ SW480 cell
viability was significantly decreased by EZH2 knockdown
compared with non-treatment and control transfection
(p<0.05) (Figure 6D).
To further specify the mechanism by which
EZH2 silencing inhibited CD133+/CD44+ SW480 cell
proliferation, we analyzed apoptosis in CD133+/CD44+
EZH2-silenced SW480 cells via Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining (Figure 6E). As shown in Figure
6F, the apoptosis rate of shEZH2-transfected cells was
significantly higher (28.2 ± 2.4%) than that of WT (7.7
± 0.8%) and control-transfected cells (8.4 ± 0.8%). Thus,
EZH2 knockdown reduced the CCS-like cell population
by inducing apoptosis.

EZH2 inhibitor EPZ-6438 delayed tumor growth
in a xenograft model
To further explore the clinical application of EZH2
knockdown to inhibit CCS-like cell properties, we used
the clinical trial drug EPZ-6438 to perform xenograft
experiments. EPZ-6438 is currently in phase I trials in
patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell lymphoma
[53, 54]. We subcutaneously inoculated SW480 cells
into the left flank of nude mice and evaluated tumor
growth. After allowing the tumors to develop for 7 days
(~100 mm3), we randomly allocated the mice to the
EPZ-6438 (50 mg/kg) and vehicle control groups (0.5%
NaCl + 0.1% Tween-80 in dH2O). We administered the
drug via oral gavage at the indicated doses once a day
for 23 days (Figure 8A). Smaller tumors were observed
in the EPZ-6438-treated group (171.9 ± 63.9 mm3, p =
0.0009) than in the control group (884.2 ± 220.4 mm3)
(Figure 8C). The tumor weight was also decreased by
EPZ-6438 treatment (Figure 8B). The mice in the EPZ6438-treated group showed no evident difference in
body weight compared to the control mice (Figure 8D).
Mouse behaviors, feeding patterns and overall activity
were not significantly different between the groups.
Collectively, these results suggested that EPZ-6438

EZH2 knockdown inactivated the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway by increasing p21cip1
expression, leading to G1/S phase arrest
The cell cycle machinery is involved in the
maintenance or suppression of CS-like cell properties [29].
Therefore, we silenced EZH2 in sorted CD133+/CD44+
SW480 cells and performed cell cycle analysis (Figure
7A). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentage
of cells in G0/G1 (2N) phase increased from 42.8 ± 5.5%
of WT cells and 44.5 ± 5.2% of control cells to 70.2 ±
7.5% of EZH2-silenced cells (Figure 7B). In contrast, the
percentage of cells containing 2N-4N DNA (in the S or
G2 phase) decreased from 57.3 ± 5.9% of WT cells and
55.5 ± 6.0% of control cells to 29.9 ± 4.5% of EZH2silenced cells (Figure 7B). We also analyzed cell cycle
marker expression by western blot. In response to EZH2
knockdown, cyclin D1 expression decreased (Figure 7C),

DISCUSSION
These new data provide compelling evidence
that EZH2 promotes CCS-like cell expansion and CRC
progression. We further revealed a previously unknown

but critical mechanism in which EZH2 activates the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by decreasing p21cip1
expression, which suppresses G1/S phase arrest (Figure
7A-7F). These findings demonstrate that inhibiting EZH2
and its downstream activation of pathways, such as

inactivating p21cip1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was
effective in eliminating CCS-like cells and reducing CRC
progression.
Previous studies showed that EZH2 is a critical
predictor of cancer prognosis. EZH2 has high prognostic

value for prostate cancer and potentially contributes to
the development of a subtype of genetically unstable and
particularly aggressive prostate cancers [55]. High EZH2
expression is associated with an undifferentiated cellular
state in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient samples [56].
In contrast, inhibiting EZH2 reduces tumor invasion and

angiogenesis [57]. In the present study, we determined that
EZH2 might be an oncogene that performs an important
function in CRC tumor development. Moreover, we
demonstrated that EHZ2 is indispensable to CCS-like
cells. CCS-like cells are considered as the origin of cancer.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 1, the immunohistochemistry

results showed that normal tissue rarely expressed
EZH2. Therefore, EHZ2 not only serves as a predictor
of cancer prognosis but also functions as a tumorigenic
factor in CRC. Thus, interfering with EZH2 expression or
activation is a promising strategy for CRC therapy or for
preventing CRC tumorigenesis.
CS-like cells dynamically interchange between
dormant (G0 phase) and cycling phases [58, 59]. A rare
cell subset comprising 0.01–1% of the total CS-like cell

population was sufficient to induce carcinoma when
transplanted into immunodeficient mice [60, 61]. This
finding suggested that cycling CS-like cells are a target
for eradicating cancer [62]. Indeed, accumulating studies
have highlighted that arresting the cell cycle in CS-like
cells decreases tumorigenesis [63–65]. For example, the
E3 ligase Skp2, a critical factor in cell-cycle progression,
restricted cancer progression and metastasis [63].

suppresses CS-like cell migration, and induces breast
cancer differentiation [65]. Here, we identified a novel
function of EZH2 based on the finding that silencing
EZH2 arrested CCS-like cells in the G1/S phase (Figure
7A-7B). However, agents such as adriamycin arrest
the cell cycle and induce a quiescent state rather than
depleting cancer cells, and this effect has been reported to
contribute to cancer recurrence [66, 67]. CS-like cells may
have an inherent ability to escape depletion resulting from
cell cycle arrest, as these cells exhibit defects in cell cycle
checkpoints [68–70]. Surprisingly, EZH2 knockdown
preferentially inhibits CCS-like cells by inducing CCS-like
cell apoptosis (Figure 6E-6F). Therefore, we conclude that
cell cycle arrest is a pivotal contributor to the eradication
of CS-like cells to cure cancer via the regulation of EZH2
expression.
The mechanism by which EZH2 contributes to
the maintenance of CS-like cell properties in CRC is not
clearly understood. Here, we suggest that suppressing
EZH2 expression caused an increase in p21cip1 expression,
which was associated with the maintenance of CS-like cell
properties (Figure 7C-7D). H3K27 is trimethylated at the
p21cip1 promoter upon direct binding to EZH2 [71]. Indeed,
loss of p21cip1 is associated with CS-like cell properties,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and carcinoma
progression [72, 73]. Inhibiting H3K27 methylation at the
p21cip1 promoter increases p21cip1 expression and elevates
the stemness properties of embryonic stem cells [74].
Thus, the decrease of p21cip1 expression caused by EZH2
may be a consequence of EZH2 epigenetic silencing.
The critical mechanism by which p21cip1
suppresses CS-like properties is controversial [36–39].
Here, we demonstrated a critical mechanism for the
inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity by p21cip1
in CRC. β-catenin expression was rescued by p21cip1
knockdown after silencing EZH2 (Figure 7E). This
effect was accompanied by an increase in c-Myc and
vimentin expression, reflecting Wnt/β-catenin pathway
activation (Figure 7E). Additionally, p21cip1 inhibits
the cell cycle by phosphorylating critical substrates
such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) [33, 34].
Moreover, in canonical Wnt signaling, the Wnt pathway
is activated by increasing β-catenin stability via β-catenin
phosphorylation at different sites [75]. Phosphorylation
at serine residues 552 and 675 prevents β-catenin
degradation and increases β-catenin transcriptional activity
[76–79]. Conversely, β-catenin is ubiquitinated and
degraded by casein kinase 1 at serine 45 and by glycogen
synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) at threonine 41, serine 37, and
serine 33 [78, 79]. Therefore, these results may establish a
mechanism by which EZH2 promotes CS-like properties
by inhibiting p21cip1 expression via the enhancement
of H3K27 methylation at the p21cip1 promoter, thereby
altering β-catenin phosphorylation.
EPZ-6438 has generally been used to treat
lymphoma patients [53]. Consistent with its effects on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

B-cell lymphoma, EPZ-6438 suppressed the growth of
CRC xenografts (Figure 8). Previous studies revealed
that heterogeneity in gene expression may predict
the effectiveness of individualized treatment of CRC
patients [80]. We suggest a mechanism that EZH2
suppresses p21cip1 expression to maintain CCS-like
cell properties (Figure 7). Knocking down p21cip1 in
EZH2-silenced cells resulted in stronger Wnt/β-catenin
signaling inactivation compared with EZH2 knockdown
alone (Figure 7E). Loss of p21cip1 in tumors has been
observed in a portion of CRC patients [81]. Thus,
our results suggest that EZH2 effectively eliminates
CCS-like cells and improves CRC patient prognosis
in a p21cip1-dependent manner. Therefore, EPZ-6438
holds clinical potential for the selective treatment of
CRC patients expressing p21cip1. Our findings provide
individualized selection criteria for the application of
EPZ-6438 to CRC therapy.
In summary, we demonstrated that EZH2 performs
a pivotal and essential function in maintaining CCS-like
properties and that repression of p21cip1 by EZH2 is a
novel regulatory mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
inactivation. These data suggest a promising molecular
target for eradicating CCS-like cells and open new
avenues for targeted CRC therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue specimens
Paraffin-embedded CRC specimens and fresh
frozen CRC tissues (n = 81) (Table 1) were obtained from
the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical
University, Chongqing, China. The specimens included 3
T1 status CRC tissues, 6 T2 tissues, 63 T3 tissues, and 9
T4 tissues. All samples were confirmed by pathological
examination, and staging was performed according to the
1997 CRC staging system of the UICC. Among the 81
CRC samples, 41 were from male patients and 40 were
from female patients, with ages ranging from 24 to 90
years (median, 70 years). Informed consent was obtained
from all patients, and this study was approved by the
ethics committee of Southwest Hospital of the Third
Military Medical University.

Statistical analysis of microarray data
Gene expression data from TCGA database were
obtained at https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu. Pearson’s
correlation coefficients were used to determine the P
values for co-expression.

Cell culture
Human CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, and LoVo)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection

(Manassas, VA, USA). The SW480 and SW620 cells
were maintained in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (Invitrogen
Corp., USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen Corp., USA). The LoVo cells were maintained
in DMEM (Invitrogen Corp., USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corp., USA). All
cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2.

USA). Specific antibody–antigen complexes were
detected using the SuperSignal West Femto Detection
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The membranes
were scanned using a ChemiDoc CCD camera
system (BioRad, USA). The Western blots shown are
representative of at least three independent experiments.
β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:5000) was used as
the loading control.

CCK-8 assay

Mammosphere formation assay

After transfection with a scramble sequence or
shEZH2, SW480 and SW620 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (5×103 cells per well) at 100 μl of cell suspension
per well. After transfection with a scramble sequence or
EZH2, LoVo cells were also seeded in 96-well plates. After
culturing for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, 10 μl of CCK-8 solution
(Invitrogen Corp., USA) was added to each well, and the
cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. The
absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax
M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). The assay was conducted in six replicate wells
for each sample, and three parallel experiments were
performed.

Dissociated single cells (1,000 per well) were
seeded in 6-well ultra-low-attachment plates (Corning
Costar). The cells were cultured in serum-free
DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen Corp., USA) supplemented
with 20 ng/ml epithelial growth factor (EGF, Sigma
Aldrich, USA), 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF, PeproTech) and B27 (BD Biosciences, USA) for
9 days. All spheres were photographed under an inverted
microscope (10×, Olympus). The number and diameter
of spheres were calculated using Image-Pro Plus 6.0
software (Olympus).

Colony formation assay

For CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation detection,
SW480 cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS
via centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 5 min). The collected
cells were incubated with APC-conjugated anti-CD133
(Miltenyi Biotec, DE) and PE-conjugated anti-CD44
antibodies (BD Biosciences, USA) or isotype control
antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions
for 30 min at 4°C while protected from light. The cells
were then suspended in 1 ml of PBS and subjected to
flow cytometry analysis (Beckman, USA). Side-scatter
and forward-scatter profiles were used to eliminate cell
doublets [82]. The statistical results of three independent
experiments are presented.
For isolation of the CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation
from SW480 cells, the above steps were followed, but the
cells were sorted via fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS).
For the detection of apoptosis, cells were harvested
and dissociated in PBS. The samples were stained with
Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry
using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).
For cell cycle analysis, DNA content was examined
by PI staining. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes,
and both adherent and floating cells were collected for
analysis. The cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol, stained
with 1 mg/ml PI and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (FACSCan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
The fluorescence profiles represent the DNA contents of
PI-positive cells.

Flow cytometry analysis

Dissociated untreated, control-transfected or
shEZH2-transfected SW480 or SW620 cells were seeded
in 6-cm dishes at a density of 1,000 cells per dish.
After 15 days in culture, the colonies were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C and stained with 0.4% crystal
violet for 10 min at room temperature. Data were acquired
from three independent experiments, and the number of
colonies was counted.

Western blot analysis
After transfection with the scramble or shEZH2
plasmid, SW480 and SW620 cells were harvested
and lysed in RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were
determined via the Bradford assay. Then, cell lysates
(20 μg) were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane (Merck Millipore).
The membranes were blocked in 3% skim milk
(Becton Dickinson) and incubated with the indicated
antibodies, including antibodies against CK20 (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Nanog (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:1000), Sox2 (Cell Signaling Technology,
1:1000), EZH2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000),
β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:5000), vimentin
(Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), cyclin D1 (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:1000), and p21cip1 (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:1000). The membranes were
subsequently incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,

were
sectioned, deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
for immunohistochemical staining [83]. Antigen
retrieval was performed using sodium citrate. The
sections were then incubated in H2O2 (3%) for 10 min,
blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and
incubated with an anti-EZH2 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:400) at 4°C overnight. After incubation
with a secondary antibody for 60 min, the specimens
were incubated with H2O2-diaminobenzidine until the
desired staining intensity was observed. The sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and
mounted. Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated in
accordance with the immunoreactive score (IRS), in which
IRS = staining intensity (SI) X percentage of positive cells
(PP). SI was scored as follows: negative SI = 0; weak SI
= 1; moderate SI = 2; and strong SI = 3. Similarly, PP was
scored as follows: negative PP = 0; 10% PP = 1; 11–50%
PP = 2; 51–80% PP = 3; and >80% PP = 4. All specimens
used for immunohistochemical staining were evaluated
and scored by at least two independent pathologists.

Animal model
For re-implantation assays, SW480 cells (untreated,
control-transfected or shEZH2-transfected) were
subcutaneously implanted into 4-6-week-old nude mice (n
= 6). The tumor volume (a×b2/2; a represents the greatest
diameter, and b represents the diameter perpendicular to a)
was measured with calipers twice a week. After 42 days,
the mice were euthanized, and the xenograft tumors were
immediately dissected. After mincing, the xenograft tissue
was trypsinized in 0.5% collagenase I and then cultured
in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (Invitrogen Corp., USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen
Corp., USA). After 12-16 h, the adherent cells were
harvested and re-implanted into secondary nude mice at
the appropriate density.
For the drug treatment model, SW480 cells (5×106)
were subcutaneously implanted into 4-6-week-old nude
mice (n = 6). After 7 days, all mice that developed tumors
~100 mm3 in volume were randomly allocated to receive
either EPZ-6438 or vehicle (0.5% NaCMC + 0.1%
Tween-80 in water) at 50 mg/kg daily via oral gavage
[53]. The tumor volume (a×b2/2; a represents the greatest
diameter, and b represents the diameter perpendicular to a)
was measured every day using calipers. Other indicators
of general health were monitored. After 23 days, the
mice were euthanized, and the xenograft tumors were
immediately dissected, weighed, stored and fixed. All
of our animal studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Third Military
Medical University.

Plasmid construction and transfection
Lentiviral particles for EZH2 were purchased
from Neuron Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Cells were incubated with lentivirus and polybrene for
12-16 h, after which the medium was changed. Seven
days after transfection, the cells were incubated in
selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life
Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 14
days of selection, individual G418-resistant colonies
were subcloned. Protein expression was analyzed by
immunoblotting. The target sequence for p21cip1 siRNA
was 5′-ACAAGGGUACAAGACAGUGAC-3′ (Sangon
Biotech, Shanghai), and negative control siRNA sequence
was 5′-CCACUACCUGAGCACCCAGUU-3′ (Sangon
Biotech, Shanghai). siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted
in DEPC water to 20 μmol/L. Opti-MEM (Invitrogen
Corp., USA) containing siRNA oligonucleotides (10 μl)
was transfected into SW480 cells using Lipofectamine
2000 (#11668-019, Invitrogen Corp., USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistical analysis
Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and was repeated at least three times. Unless otherwise
indicated, the data are presented as the means ± S.D. of
three independent experiments. Statistics were calculated
using SPSS software (version 16.0). Differences in a given
variable between groups were assessed using two-tailed
Student’s t-tests, Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s χ2 test.
A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). For cancer
survival analysis, Kaplan–Meier survival curves of overall
survival were used.

RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen Corp., USA) and was employed to generate
cDNA using Superscript III RT (Invitrogen Corp.,
USA) and an oligo(dT) primer. Real-time RT-PCR
was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix (Invitrogen Corp., USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. GAPDH was used as the
internal control. The primers used are as follows:
