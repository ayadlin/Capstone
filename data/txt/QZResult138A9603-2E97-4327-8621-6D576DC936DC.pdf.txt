Abstract
The DNA damage response (DDR) is a comprehensive and
complex network of phosphorylation-mediated signaling pathways that originates endogenously from the DNA lesion and
activates intrinsic DNA repair mechanisms. Here we describe a
macrophage-dependent mechanism that regulates the response to
DNA damage. We demonstrate that human monocytes, by releasing macrophage-derived HB-EGF, enhance DDR in neighboring
cells suffering from DNA damage. Consequently, HB-EGF–treated cells exhibit higher double-strand break (DSB) rejoining and
display lower levels of residual DSBs. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)

injection induce DSBs along with elevation in the number of
macrophages and HB-EGF expression. Signiﬁcantly, macrophage
depletion or blocking HB-EGF activity results in higher levels of
nonrepairable DSBs, suggesting that macrophages play a role in
the resolution of DNA damage via HB-EGF. This study establishes
that macrophages, acting through the activation of the EGFR
cascade, constitute an important cell nonautonomous physiologic component of the DDR and points to a unique role
played by immune cells in maintaining genome integrity. Cancer

Introduction

DNA damage and trigger DNA repair. Generation of DNA breaks
elicits the activation of sophisticated surveillance mechanisms,
collectively called the DNA damage response (DDR; ref. 7). The
cellular response to DNA breaks is orchestrated by signal transduction pathways, where the protein kinases ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR),
act as master regulators. ATM is activated by monomerization and
autophosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates downstream
proteins including the histone H2AX (known as gH2AX) enabling
the recruitment of an array of proteins involved in DNA repair
(8, 9). H2AX is phosphorylated over a large region surrounding
the DSB and forms readily visualized foci (10).
Many decisions affect the fate of DNA-damaged cell, for example, how to repair the damage or whether to repair it at all. These
decisions mainly rely on the extent of initial damage. Relatively
minor DNA damage induces transient cell-cycle arrest and then
the cell recovers to normal growth after the damage is effectively
repaired. At high damage levels, the damaged cells enter permanent cycle arrest and senescence and in the event of irreparable
damage die by apoptosis. These decisions are critical as failure of
this process that enables cells to progress through the cell cycle
even in the face of incomplete repair of the damaged DNA results
in genome instability, chromosomal aberrations that are
expressed by the cell and its progeny thus increasing the risk of
cancer, neurodegeneration, and other pathologies (11, 12).
The immune system is well known for its function in defending
the host against pathogen invasion. However, in recent years, it
has become clear that in addition to its defensive function, the
immune system also serves to maintain homeostasis in the face of
constant assaults by endogenous and environmental agents (13),
and it is called into action by alarm signals released by tissues
undergoing stress, damage, or abnormal necrotic death (13, 14).
In the course of our search for signals that alert the immune system
to stress, we found that cells exposed to oxidative stress release
"ﬁnd-me" signals that selectively attract human monocytes

Cells are continuously subjected to a barrage of DNA damage
from both endogenous and external sources. Oxidative stress
caused by extracellular and intracellular production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) represent a fundamental mechanism that
contributes to DNA damage. ROS overproduction that exceeds
defense mechanisms may damage intracellular macromolecules,
including nucleic acids, with the formation of DNA adducts and
DNA strand breaks that can result in mutations (1–4). It is
estimated that each cell's genomic DNA undergoes thousands of
oxidative hits per day, and even more under conditions of stress.
Consequently, persistent oxidative stress due to ROS is widely
considered to be important in the pathology of a range of human
diseases and has been speciﬁcally associated with carcinogenesis
and cancer progression (5, 6).
Among the various forms of DNA damage, double-strand
breaks (DSB) are the most lethal for cells because failure to repair
them can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosome
rearrangements. Nevertheless, cells have evolved multiple signaling pathways and biochemical mechanisms that counter-balance

and mouse macrophages (15). Importantly, this response was
mediated by a cooperation between class A scavenger receptors
and signaling through MyD88. Surprisingly, although monocyte
migration was MyD88-dependent it was not accompanied by
inﬂammatory cytokine secretion (15). This latter ﬁnding left us
with the question of what is the role of migrating macrophages in
the response to stress. Because, as mentioned above, oxidizing
conditions can induce a range of DNA lesions, including DSBs
(1, 16, 17), in the current study we asked whether macrophages
could regulate the DDR and DNA repair mechanisms thereby
conferring additive protection from injury.
Here we demonstrate that macrophages via HB-EGF–EGFR–
mediated pathway enhance preexisting DDR network and accelerate DSB rejoining. These ﬁndings unveil a novel, extrinsic,
physiologic (immune cell–mediated) system that, in addition to
the cell-autonomous pathway, regulates the cellular response to
DNA damage and may contribute to increased resistance of cells
to DNA damage and to the restoration of homeostasis at the tissue
level.

Materials and Methods
Animal model
Experimental protocol was approved by the Hebrew University
Institutional Animal Care and Ethical Committee.
For the induction of DNA damage in vivo, 20-day-old C57BL/6
male mice (Harlan) were injected intraperitoneally with DEN (10
mg/kg body wt; Sigma-Aldrich). For macrophage depletion, clodronate-containing liposomes or control PBS-containing liposomes (ClodronateLiposomes) were injected at 150 mL per mouse
2 days before DEN injection and continued every other day. HBEGF function was blocked by injection of 75 mg cross-reacting
material 197 (CRM197, Sigma-Aldrich) per mouse. Macrophages
from mouse livers were isolated as previously described (18).
More than 90% of isolated cells were macrophages as assessed by
F4/80 positivity.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Parafﬁn-embedded liver tissue sections were incubated with rat
anti-mouse F4/80 monoclonal antibodies (AbD Serotc) or rat
anti-mouse Ly6B.2 (AbD Serotc), followed by a secondary antibody anti-rat for mouse tissue (N-Histoneﬁne) labeled with
streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase using a DAB staining kit
(Invitrogen). An Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus) was used
for image acquisition. To estimate DNA damage, parafﬁn-embedded liver tissue sections were immunoﬂuorescence stained with
anti-phospho-histone H2AX (gH2AX) monoclonal antibody
(Millipore) followed by Alexa-488 goat anti mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). The number of F4/80-positive cells was determined
by manual counting of at least 10 ﬁelds per sample. Positive
gH2AX areas in mice livers were calculated using ImageJ software.
HB-EGF gene expression analysis
The relative level of HB-EGF mRNA in mouse livers was
determined by real-time PCR using HPRT mRNA for normalization. Primer sequences are available upon request.
Cells
Primary human dermal ﬁbroblasts (HDF) and CD14þ cells
were isolated and incubated as previously described (15). In the
in vitro experimental protocol, which is adapted from our previous
work (15), HDF were either incubated with hydrogen peroxide

2664 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

in PBS for 1 hour or were mock-treated with PBS only, and were
then washed with fresh media. Only at that stage, either monocytes, HB-EGF, or EGF were added to the culture, and this time
point is hence denoted as time 0. The cells were then incubated for
the indicated time points and were analyzed as described in
Supplementary Methods.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting
HDF were either mock-treated (PBS) or peroxide-treated
(H2O2; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour. The cells were then washed
and fresh media was added. Monocytes were placed in the top
chamber of Transwell membranes (Corning; 0.4 mm pore size) of
lower wells containing HDF and incubated for the indicated time
points. In other experiments, either EGF (Sigma-Aldrich) or HBEGF (R&D Systems) were added at the indicated concentrations.
In certain experiments, cells were treated with the following
signaling inhibitors: clinical grade geﬁtinib (100 mmol/L;
Iressa/ZD1830 AstraZeneca), PD0325901 (1 mmol/L; SigmaAldrich), SC-514 (50 mmol/L; Cayman Chemical). At each time
point, Transwell top chamber was removed and whole-cell
extracts were prepared from the HDF at the bottom chamber by
lysing the cells with X3 SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were
separated by electrophoresis on 15% or 6% SDS-PAGE gels and
then transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (BioRad). The blots were probed with anti-phosphorylated ATM
antibody (Ser1981; Epitomics), anti-phosphorylated DNA-PK
(Ser2056; Abcam), anti-phosphorylated ATR (Ser428; Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-phosphorylated H2AX (gH2AX,
Ser139; Bethyl), anti-phosphorylated P38 (R&D Systems), antiphosphorylated ERK (Sigma-Aldrich), or anti- phosphorylated
AKT (Cell Signaling Technology). Following stripping, the membranes were reprobed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody
(mAb; MP Biomedicals, LLC).
Flow cytometry
Freshly isolated monocytes were washed twice in PBS, and
stained using anti-HB-EGF mAb (R&D Systems) for 30 minutes
on ice, followed by a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-goat
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were washed twice in PBS and
the immunostained cells were analyzed by a FACS Calibur ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the Cell Quest software.
Confocal microscopy
Confocal microscopy analysis of peroxide-treated HDF was
performed as previously described (15), using anti-gH2AX mAb
(Ser139, Millipore) and anti-53BP1 (Bethyl), followed by the
secondary antibodies Alexa-488 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes)
and donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and nuclei
were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Calbiochem). Images were obtained by a laser scanning confocal
microscope system (FluoView-1000; Olympus) with a 40
UPLAN-SApo objective and 2 digital zoom. The numbers of
foci per nucleus were calculated using ImageJ software.
HB-EGF ELISA assays
Conditioned media were collected from cultures containing
mock- or peroxide-treated HDF with or without monocytes or
monocytes cultured alone. HB-EGF levels in the conditioned
media were assayed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's
protocol (R&D Systems).

Results
Macrophages play a role in the resolution of DNA damage in
DEN-treated mouse livers
To test our hypothesis that macrophages play a role in DDR,
we ﬁrst used a mouse model where we have induced oxidative
DNA damage in mouse livers by a single injection of DEN. DEN
is a DNA alkylating agent that leads to the formation of mutagenic DNA adducts. In addition, DEN metabolic activation by
cytochrome P450 can generate ROS (19), which consequently

damage proteins, lipids, and DNA (20–22). Phosphorylated
histone H2AX (gH2AX) foci formation is an accepted and reliable
quantitative marker of DSBs, providing a sensitive assay to monitor DNA damage (23, 24). We therefore performed immunoﬂuorescence staining to detect nuclear foci containing gH2AX
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) in liver tissue sections at various time
points after DEN injection. gH2AX foci were clearly evident
around the portal triads 24 hours after DEN injection (Fig. 1A
and B) and persisted up to 3 days postinjection. The number of
cells harboring gH2AX foci then declined signiﬁcantly at 6 and 9
days, leaving only few cells with detectable foci (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1B). This time-dependent recovery is likely due
to the activity of various DNA repair mechanisms (24, 25). The
increase in the number of gH2AX foci in DEN-injected livers
was accompanied by inﬁltration of F4/80þ cells (Fig. 1C), but
not of neutrophils (data not shown). In our previous study
(15), we have clearly demonstrated that malondialdehyde
(MDA), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, is sensed by macrophages through scavenger receptors and induce their attraction
in a MyD88-dependent mechanism. Similarly, in DEN-treated
livers, early increase in MDA concentration is detected (26).
Addition of N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant able to minimize
the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, to the drinking water
signiﬁcantly reduced macrophage recruitment following DEN
injection (Supplementary Fig. S1C). To test speciﬁcally for a
role of macrophages in the DDR, we depleted macrophages
using clodronate liposomes (Fig. 1D). We speciﬁcally measured
how macrophage depletion affects the amount of residual
gH2AX foci that is observed 2 and 6 days after DEN injection
as a measure of the overall DSB repair capacity. While there was
no signiﬁcant difference in the extent of initial damage in the
livers two days after DEN injection (Fig. 1E), in the absence of
macrophages, both the extent and the intensity of residual DSBs
6 days after DEN injection were signiﬁcantly higher as compared with control mice that were treated with PBS-containing
liposomes (Fig. 1F), suggesting that macrophages play a role in
the resolution of DNA damage in the liver.
Monocytes enhance DDR via HB-EGF release
To further assess DDR signaling pathways, HDFs were exposed
to peroxide, which like DEN inﬂicts double-strand breaks, and
incubated for variable time periods after peroxide removal. At the
end of the incubation periods, HDFs were lysed and the phosphorylation of H2AX, and of the sensor kinases ATM, ATR, and
DNA-PK (27, 28), were determined. Progressive accumulation of
gH2AX and pATM was observed in peroxide-treated, but not in
mock-treated HDFs. Phosphorylation of these two markers was
observed 30 minutes after exposure to peroxide and continued to
accumulate even after peroxide removal (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Phosphorylation of DNA-PK and of ATR that are predominantly related to single-strand breaks, was not detected (not
shown).
To assess whether monocytes inﬂuence DDR signaling pathways, we have turned to an in vitro system used in our previous
study that is based on oxidative stress of primary culture of HDFs
(15). HDFs were exposed to peroxide for 1 hour as above, washed
and incubated for varying time periods with or without monocytes. To follow signaling in HDFs, monocytes were placed in an
overlying 0.4 mm Transwell and at the end of the indicated time,
monocytes in the Transwell were discarded and the HDFs were
lysed. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the addition of monocytes greatly

2666 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

enhanced phosphorylation of both H2AX and ATM in peroxidetreated HDFs, but had no effect on mock-treated cells (data not
shown).
Our ﬁnding that monocytes affect the DDR in HDF cells
while being separated from these cells by a Transwell membrane, points to a soluble factor mediating this activity. Gene
array analysis revealed that heparin-binding EGF-like growth
factor (HB-EGF) was one of the genes that were upregulated in
monocytes in response to their interaction with cells suffering
from oxidative stress (Fig. 2B). HB-EGF is a member of the
EGF family of proteins, which binds EGF receptors with a
higher afﬁnity than EGF itself and is a far more potent mitogen.
Importantly, HB-EGF transcripts are highly abundant in human
monocytes and HB-EGF is expressed on the cell surface of
monocytes/macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S1C; refs. 29,
30). Following its shedding from the surface membrane, HBEGF is involved in macrophage-mediated cellular proliferation
of ﬁbroblasts and smooth muscle cells (29, 30) The gene array
data was further corroborated by ELISA. This data documented
the release of HB-EGF from monocytes cocultured with HDFs
that were treated with either mild (50 mmol/L) or severe (500
mmol/L) peroxide conditions (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig.
S2D). HB-EGF secretion in response to stressed ﬁbroblasts was
detected as early as 3 hours (data not shown) and peaked at 24
hours (Fig. 2B). We have previously demonstrated that oxidatively stressed cells selectively attracts monocytes in a scavenger
receptors (SR)-dependent manner (15). Like monocyte migration toward stressed cells, HB-EGF release was abrogated by
treatment with the competitive SR-speciﬁc ligand, dextran
sulfate (DxSO4), but not with its noncompetitive counterpart,
chondroitin sulfate (ChSO4; Supplementary Fig. S2E), suggesting that SRs contribute to HB-EGF shedding.
Several reported ﬁndings suggested a role for HB-EGF and EGFR
signaling in the cellular response to DNA damage. HB-EGF was
found to protect cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death.
(31) Moreover, EGFR inhibition was shown to induce cellular
senescence in response to radiation and this was attributed to an
increase in the levels of nonrepairable DSBs (32), suggesting a link
between the EGF:EGFR pathway and the process of DNA damage
repair. Finally, a previous study has demonstrated that in tumor
cells exposed to ionizing radiation, activation of EGFR by EGF
enhances the DSB repair capacity, whereas inhibition of EGFR
attenuates DSB rejoining (33–35).
To investigate whether HB-EGF released by monocytes is biologically active and plays a causal role in DDR signaling, we
performed blocking antibody experiments. As seen in Fig. 2A,
the addition of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF or EGF
receptor signiﬁcantly reduced the effect exerted by monocytes on
both H2AX and ATM phosphorylation in peroxide-treated ﬁbroblasts. Interestingly, blocking antibodies reduced H2AX phosphorylation to a level lower than that observed peroxide-treated
HDFs in the absence of monocytes, suggesting a role for HB-EGF
and EGFR signaling in the DDR that is augmented in the presence
of monocytes. Moreover, the addition of recombinant human
HB-EGF (2 ng/mL) increased H2AX and ATM phosphorylation
in peroxide-treated ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 2C). HB-EGF had a similar
effect on H2AX phosphorylation when lower H2O2 concentrations were used (50 mmol/L instead of 500 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S2F), but had no effect on PBS-treated (mock) cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2G), suggesting that HB-EGF enhances the
DDR, but does not activate this signaling cascade by itself. Similar

Monocytes enhance DDR signaling in neighboring cells via HB-EGF release. A, HDFs were treated with 500 mmol/L peroxide and were then cultured with or without
either anti-HB-EGF blocking antibodies or anti-EGFR–neutralizing antibodies; the cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of monocytes placed
in a 0.4 mm Transwell insert. At the indicated time points, the Transwells were discarded and the HDFs were immediately lysed. Cell extracts were subjected to SDSPAGE and anti-phosphorylated H2AX (gH2AX) and anti-phosphorylated ATM immunoblotting. Anti-b-actin immunoblotting revealed relative amounts of

results were obtained when EGF was used instead of HB-EGF
(Fig. 2C). However, as expected from the relative lower afﬁnity
of EGF to the EGFR as compared with HB-EGF, EGF was not
active at 2 ng/mL (data not shown) and signiﬁcantly higher
concentrations of EGF were required to obtain a response similar to HB-EGF (i.e., 20–30 ng/mL EGF vs. 2 ng/mL HB-EGF).
Given that in general there is a direct relationship between the
number of microscopically visualized gH2AX foci and the extent
of DNA DSBs in an individual cell, we further evaluated gH2AX
foci formation in HDFs following exposure to peroxide. At the end
of the peroxide treatment (time 0 hour) there was a dramatic
induction of foci in all cells, which increased over time, reaching a
peak at around 60 minutes after treatment. These foci were
relatively small and indistinct, probably because of their large
number (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3A). In the presence of
HB-EGF, there was an increase in the intensity of gH2AX staining
observed in peroxide- but not in mock-treated HDFs (Fig. 2D and
data not shown). However, owing to the large number of gH2AX
foci, it was not possible to determine whether the increase
observed was due to a higher overall number of foci or that each
foci became brighter and larger.
HB-EGF facilitates DNA breaks rejoining
To further evaluate the effect of HB-EGF on DNA DSBs repair
following oxidative damage, we have used the comet assay,
which reﬂects the degree of DNA fragmentation in individual
cells (36, 37). HDFs that were exposed to peroxide and then
incubated in the presence or absence of HB-EGF were subjected to the neutral comet assay to detect DSBs (Fig. 2E).
Signiﬁcant amount of DSB were evident in cells immediately
after peroxide exposure and this damage increased following
incubation. Surprisingly, in the presence of HB-EGF, there
was no signiﬁcant difference in the extent of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the early increase in the
global gH2AX and pATM levels (Fig. 2C and D) in the
presence of HB-EGF is not due to an increase in the number
of DNA breaks but most likely a sign of enhanced DDR
signaling induced by HB-EGF.
The phosphorylation of H2AX is considered an important
step in the signaling and initiation of the DNA DSB repair
process, and early gH2AX foci represent either a single or a
cluster of DSB that are actively being repaired. (38) Hence, the
early increased response observed within the ﬁrst few hours in
the presence of HB-EGF (that is not coupled to enhanced DNA
fragmentation) likely represents sites of enhanced DDR signaling and ongoing DSB repair. On the other hand, a decline in the
number of gH2AX foci over time is believed to reﬂect the
kinetics of DNA DSB repair per se. (8) Therefore, we next
evaluated the number of residual gH2AX foci 24 hours after
treatment. The high numbers of gH2AX foci observed following
peroxide treatment (Fig. 2D and data not shown) signiﬁcantly
declined after 24 hours, leaving only few distinct foci in each
cell (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). These distinct
nuclear foci also displayed costaining with 53BP1, an established player in the cellular response to DNA damage that is
also recruited to damage sites (Supplementary Fig. S3B; ref. 39).
As expected, the average number of residual foci per cell was
signiﬁcantly higher in cells treated with 500 mmol/L H2O2 than
in cells treated with 50 mmol/L H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, in
the presence of either HB-EGF or EGF, the average number of
residual gH2AX foci per cell was signiﬁcantly lower compared

2668 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

with control peroxide-treated HDFs at both peroxide concentrations (Fig. 3A and B).
To correlate the number of remaining microscopically visualized gH2AX foci 24 hours after peroxide treatment and the extent
of DNA fragmentation, we further evaluated the effect of HB-EGF
on DNA DSB repair following oxidative damage, using the neutral
comet assay (Fig. 3C). A signiﬁcant amount of DSBs were evident
in cells immediately following exposure to peroxide (at both
50 and 500 mmol/L), before the addition of HB-EGF or EGF.
Under the severe stress condition of 500 mmol/L peroxide,
the extent of DSBs was considerably high even after 24 hours,
in agreement with the high number of residual gH2AX foci
in these cells (Fig. 3B), whereas under mild peroxide concentration (50 mmol/L), the majority of DSBs disappeared after
24 hours (Fig. 3C). A small but signiﬁcant decrease in the extent
of DNA fragmentation was seen in HB-EGF- and EGF-treated
cells as compared with their untreated counterparts, implying
that DSB rejoining was higher in these cells. As expected, under
the severe stress condition (500 mmol/L peroxide), the extent of
DSBs was still considerably high even in the presence of either
HB-EGF or EGF. Given that DSBs were apparent before the
addition of HB-EGF, we conclude that cells treated with HBEGF repaired DSBs more efﬁciently.
To test whether the lower number of residual gH2AX foci per
cell and the corresponding DSBs (detected by the comet assay)
represented more efﬁcient repair in HB-EGF–treated cells, we
asked whether HB-EGF could promote homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair. To test this, we used an in vivo
inducible on/off switch GFP reporter system that was previously
described by Shahar and colleagues (40). The reporter used is
designed to measure error-free HR of a site-speciﬁc break formed
by the rare-cutting endonuclease I-SceI. In this reporter system, an
HR repair of the I-Sce1–induced DSB restores GFP gene. To that
end, we treated U2OS cells carrying the EGFP-based HR substrate
with dexamethasone to activate the endonuclease I-Sce1, and then
incubated the cells for 72 hours with or without either HB-EGF or
EGF. HR activity was examined by ﬂow cytometry to determine
the frequency of GFP-positive cells, indicating HR-mediated
repair events. In the absence of dexamethasone, the percentage of
GFPþ cells remained low and was the same in the absence or
presence of HB-EGF or EGF in the culture. Upon activation of the
HR system by dexamethasone, we detected the expression of GFP
in a small subset of cells that had undergone the relatively rare
process of HR. Notably, in the presence of HB-EGF or EGF, the
number of cells that expressed GFP, hence had undergone HR
repair, was signiﬁcantly increased compared with that in controluntreated cells (Fig. 3D).
We next followed EGFR signaling events in cells suffering
from DNA damage. Interestingly, following peroxide treatment
we observed an induction of signals associated with the EGFR
pathways including phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and P38 in
HDF cells (Fig. 4A). Notably, while EGFR triggering by HB-EGF
caused a decrease in the number of residual DSBs 24 hours after
peroxide treatment (Fig. 3A and B), blocking EGFR signaling by
geﬁtinib (that inhibits the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain) as
well as blocking MEK1/2 activity with PD0325901 or attenuating the downstream NF-kB–induced gene expression by the
IKKb-selective inhibitor SC514 increased the number of gH2AX
foci and reversed HB-EGF effect (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these
data demonstrate a link between EGFR signaling and the DSB
repair process, and suggest that an additive triggering of the

EGFR by macrophage-derived HB-EGF may further facilitate
DSBs repair.
HB-EGF rescue oxidized cells to resume proliferation
We next asked whether the observed beneﬁcial effect of HBEGF on DNA repair also affected cell-cycle arrest. Indeed, we
show here that at least under mild (i.e., 50 mmol/L peroxide)
oxidative conditions cell-cycle–arrested HDF can resume proliferation in the presence of HB-EGF (Supplementary Fig. S3E–
S3G). Interestingly, as revealed by carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution experiments following peroxide treatment all HDF completed one cell division at the ﬁrst
24 hours, and then stopped proliferating (see ref. 15; Supplementary Fig. S3H). Moreover, in the 500 mmol/L H2O2-treated
HDF, the addition of monocytes or HB-EGF did not restore
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3H). Since, under the same

www.aacrjournals.org

conditions, signiﬁcant increase in DSBs rejoining is observed
(Fig. 3A and B), the data suggest that HB-EGF effect on DNA
repair cannot be solely explained by HB-EGF mitogenic activity
that promotes cell-cycle entry, during which HR is mainly
utilized.
Blocking HB-EGF activity attenuates DSBs repair in vivo
Finally, we tested whether HB-EGF plays a role in the DDR in
vivo, using DEN-treated mice. After DEN injection, HB-EGF
mRNA levels in mouse livers increased, peaking at 2 to 3 days
after injection and declining to basal levels by days 6 to 9
(Fig. 5A). This kinetics of HB-EGF expression corresponds to
the number of F4/80þ cells in DEN-injected livers (Fig. 1C).
Macrophages puriﬁed from mouse livers before and after DEN
injection contained signiﬁcantly higher levels of HB-EGF transcripts when compared with the corresponding whole liver

tissues (Fig. 5B, left). Moreover, total HB-EGF expression in
DEN-treated livers was signiﬁcantly reduced after depletion of
macrophages using clodronate liposomes, and declined to
levels lower than those found in untreated animals (Fig. 5B,
right). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HB-EGF is
predominantly expressed by resident kupffer cells and by
macrophages recruited to DEN-treated livers, and are consistent
with previous data showing that HB-EGF mRNA levels
increased primarily in kuppfer cells after partial liver hepatectomy but not in hepatocytes (41).
Cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197) is a diphtheria toxin
mutant that binds directly to the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF
and represses its activity (42, 43). Notably, mice treated with
CRM197 exhibited signiﬁcant increase in residual DSB 6 days
after DEN injection as compared with control mice (Fig. 5C).
While this result was also achieved by macrophage depletion
(Fig. 1E), it is important to note that CRM197 treatment had
no effect on the number of F4/80þ cells in DEN-injected livers
(Fig. 5D).
In summary, our study provides a novel insight on how the
macrophages via the EGFR signaling pathway maintains genome
integrity by enhancing DNA damage signaling and facilitating
repair in neighboring cells.

Discussion
In this study, we have uncovered a new and as yet unknown
function for macrophages that act both in mice and humans.
The data presented here show that macrophages participate
in vivo in the regulation of DDR. Moreover, the release of HBEGF by macrophages allows these cells to coordinate the DDR
in animals experiencing DSBs. Our results show that shortly
after the induction of DSBs in mouse livers the numbers of
macrophages increased and the levels of HB-EGF transcripts
were elevated. Both subside by day 6 after DEN injection in
correlation with DSBs resolution. Signiﬁcant for this study, the

Blocking EGFR signaling attenuates DSBs repair.
A, HDFs were plated in a 24-well dish and treated
with the indicated inhibitors (see Materials and
Methods) and were either mock-treated (left) or
treated with 50 mmol/L peroxide (right).
After 1 hour, the cells were washed and fresh
culture media was added. At the indicated time
points, HDFs were immediately lysed. Cell
extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting using antiphosphorylated AKT, anti- phosphorylated
ERK, and anti-phosphorylated P38. Anti-b-actin
immunoblotting revealed relative amounts of
protein in each lane. B, HDFs were plated on a
cover slide in a 6-well dish and were treated as in
A in the presence or absence of the indicated
inhibitors. After 1 hour, the cells were washed and
fresh culture media was added and the cells
were cultured for 24 hours in the presence or
absence of HB-EGF (2 ng/mL). Then, HDFs were
ﬁxed and immunostained using anti- gH2AX
mAb. Graph shows the number (median  SEM)
of gH2AX foci per cell (at least 100 nuclei

resolution of DSBs was signiﬁcantly impaired in the absence of
macrophages or when HB-EGF activity is selectively blocked as
determined by the number of remaining gH2AX foci. Thus, we
propose that in addition to the autonomous mechanisms of
DDR and repair that transpire inside the cell, the recruitment of
hematopoietic cells, constitute an additional, cell-extrinsic, or
nonautonomous regulatory circuit for maintaining genome
integrity at the tissue level. In accord with this proposal (Supplementary Fig. S4), in response to oxidative DNA damage
(15), macrophages are recruited to the damaged site and in turn
invoke a signaling pathway that is based on the release of
HB-EGF and triggering of the EGFR pathway that interacts with
the cell DDR. As a consequence, DDR is enhanced, leading to
higher DSBs rejoining.
While in this study we suggest that macrophage-derived HBEGF plays a central role in the DDR it is important to note
that HB-EGF expression is not limited to macrophages as
previous reports have demonstrated the expression of HB-EGF
in various other cell types. Indeed, HB-EGF transcripts were
readily detected in HDFs and the protein was detected in HDFconditioned media, albeit at signiﬁcantly lower levels as compared with monocytes. Moreover, EGFR signaling is clearly
activated in peroxide-treated HDFs and blocking EGFR signaling pathway by speciﬁc inhibitors attenuates DSB rejoining.
Nevertheless, we suggest that this process is further regulated
systemically by excess release of HB-EGF by monocytes and
macrophages that in turn augment DDR signaling and facilitate
damage repair.
The exact mechanism downstream to EGFR signaling and the
way it interacts with the DDR remains to be established. Several
previous studies have demonstrated that ionizing radiation activated the DNA repair genes the X-ray cross-complementing group
1 protein (XRCC1) and the nucleotide excision repair gene
(ERCC1) in an ERK1/2-dependent fashion, and that activation
of EGFR by EGF administration markedly increased the
up-regulation of phosphorylated-ERK, ERCC1 and XRCC1

(44–48). These observations suggest a role for EGFR-induced
MAPK signaling in the recovery from DNA damage following
exposure to ionizing radiation. Moreover, a study by Dittmann
and colleagues (49) suggested that EGFR translocates to the
nucleus in response to radiation-induced DNA damage, and more
importantly, the nuclear EGFR shuttling was shown to be
involved in the DNA damage repair. Nonetheless, our ﬁndings
support these and other reports that demonstrated that activation
of EGFR enhances overall DSB repair (33–35).
The relationship between the immune system and cancer is
complex and has been extensively studied. However, fundamental questions remain unanswered, such as: When are cancer
cells recognized by immune cells? What are the consequences of
this initial recognition event? Historically, the experimental
approaches to these questions have revolved around the contro-

versial notion of "tumor immune surveillance," and have been
investigated through the lens of immune-mediated cytotoxicity
and tolerance induction in established tumors or premalignant
lesions (50). This study introduces a more general perspective for
the way the immune system operates and for the notion of tumor
"immune surveillance".
The current study offers an additional angle for considering
tumor immune surveillance, by positing a unique new role for
immune cells in the earliest events of carcinogenesis. While
immune cells play decisive role at different stages of tumor
development and promotion, our current concept of immune:
tumor interactions is based on assessments of already established
tumors. This study extends the spectrum of immune effects on the
pathogenic continuum of cancer to the earliest event of carcinogenesis, i.e., the initial DNA damage that results in the

accumulation of tumor-promoting mutations. Hence, this line of
investigation provides fundamental insights into the role of
immune cells in cancer initiation.
Macrophages may promote cellular repair and provide a window of opportunity for the damaged cell to correct itself. But, this
represents a double-edge sword. While macrophages may prevent
tumor initiation by assisting the damaged tissue to overcome a
damaging DNA hit, under certain circumstances, they may contribute to cancer development by enabling cells to progress
through the cell cycle even in the face of incomplete repair of
the damaged DNA. Regardless of which edge of the "doubleedged" sword turns out to be dominant, this line of investigation
should provide fundamental insights into the role of immune
cells in cancer initiation.
In addition, in already established tumors, macrophages may
help tumor cells acquire chemo- and radioresistance by facilitating DNA damage resolution. In this regard, a recent study by
Houthuijzen and colleagues (51) has demonstrated that macrophages residing in the spleen are activated by circulating fatty acids
to secrete secondary lysophospholipids, which confer the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance in tumors by altering the DDR.
In summary, our ﬁndings move the prevailing view of the DDR
from a cell-autonomous model to a dynamic two-compartment
model, in which the immune system represents a regulatory
network that plays a role in maintaining tissue internal environment. This novel physiologic link between a classical immune cell
(macrophage) and a common cellular event (DNA damage) has
implications for a broad range of cells in diverse human diseases,
such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and other pathologies. The
elucidation of these novel pathways holds promise for revealing
new therapeutic targets.
