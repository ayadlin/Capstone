Abstract
Author Manuscript

Many tumors over express tumor-associated antigens relative to normal tissue, such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR). This limits targeting by human T cells modified to express
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) due to potential for deleterious recognition of normal cells. We
sought to generate CAR+ T cells capable of distinguishing malignant from normal cells based on
the disparate density of EGFR expression by generating two CARs from monoclonal antibodies
which differ in affinity. T cells with low affinity Nimo-CAR selectively targeted cells overexpressing EGFR, but exhibited diminished effector function as the density of EGFR decreased. In
contrast, the activation of T cells bearing high affinity Cetux-CAR was not impacted by the
density of EGFR. In summary, we describe the generation of CARs able to tune T-cell activity to

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to redirect
specificity for desired tumor-associated antigen (TAA) can be infused into patients as
immunotherapy. Because many TAAs over-expressed on tumors also have low density
expression on normal tissue, use of CAR-modified T cells to specifically target such
antigens has been limited by the potential for on-target, normal tissue toxicity. Indeed,
prolonged B-cell aplasia in patients with B-lineage leukemias and lymphomas after infusion
of CD19-specifc CAR+ T cells highlights inability to distinguish between CD19 on
malignant and normal B cells (1–3).

Author Manuscript

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignancy of the brain and
central nervous system with a median survival of ~1 year from diagnosis (4,5). Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) is aberrantly overexpressed in more than 60% of adult GBM
and contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell division, invasion, angiogenesis, and
inhibiting apoptosis (6). Clinical efforts to target EGFR on GBM with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have had limited success, apparently
due to signaling through compensatory pathways and poor blood-brain barrier penetration
(7,8). Furthermore, targeting EGFR via TKIs or mAb can cause toxicity, primarily observed
in skin, gastrointestinal system, and kidney, due distribution of EGFR on these normal
tissues (9,10).

Author Manuscript

EGFR is over-expressed on GBM relative to normal cells, which raises the possibility that
CAR+ T cells may be generated to distinguish malignant from normal cells based on EGFR
density. This is based upon published observations that T-cell activation initiated through
the endogenous αβ T-cell receptor (TCR) may result from achieving an activation threshold,
which can be triggered by binding by a few high-affinity TCRs to or greater numbers of
low-affinity TCR (11,12). We hypothesized that the affinity of a single-chain variable
fragment (scFv), which imparts CAR specificity, may be modified to impact the effector
response to the density of EGFR, such that T cells would be activated when docked with
over-expressed EGFR on tumor cells and not when low, basal EGFR expression on normal
cells.
To accomplish this, we derived two CAR species from cetuximab and nimotuzumab, which
bind to highly overlapping epitopes on EGFR, yet exhibit different affinities (13).
Nimotuzumab has a 10-fold lower Kd than cetuximab resulting from a 59-fold reduced onrate of binding, which imparts a requirement for (at least) bivalent binding to EGFR and
restricts the binding to cells expressing high density EGFR (13–15). Therefore, we
generated two 2nd EGFR-specific CARs, which derive their specificity from the scFv

regions of nimotuzumab (Nimo-CAR) or cetuximab (Cetux-CAR), and are activated by
chimeric CD28 and CD3-ζ cytosolic domains. We observed that T cells could be fully
activated by both Nimo-CAR and Cetux-CAR when EGFR was expressed at high density on
glioma cells. However, at reduced levels of EGFR expression, the lower affinity NimoCAR+ T cells exhibited reduced T-cell activation while Cetux-CAR+ T cells maintained
efficient activation independent of EGFR density. In summary, we describe a strategy to
engineer T cells to distinguish tumor from normal cells based on tuning the functional
affinity of CAR to selectively target cells over-expressing EGFR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA plasmids

Author Manuscript

The derivation of Cetux-CAR and Nimo-CAR is described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Cetux-CAR and Nimo-CAR were cloned as Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons
under control of hEF1-α promoter, as previously described (16). Codon-optimized truncated
human EGFR (amino acids 1–668, NP_005219.2; GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany) was
cloned under expression of hEF1-α promoter followed by F2A cleavable peptide and
neomycin phosphotransferase. CARL was derived from hybridoma clone 2D3 (17).
Cell lines

Author Manuscript

Cell lines obtained from ATCC include: EL4 (2009), NALM-6 (2011), U87 (2012), T98G
(2012), LN18 (2012) and A431 (2012). K562 clone 9 were generated by stable expression of
41BB-L, CD86, CD64 and tCD19 (18) and were a kind gift from Dr. Carl June (University
of Pennsylvania), obtained in 2007. U87-172b cells, designated U87high in this study,
overexpressing wild-type EGFR were a kind gift from Dr. Oliver Bolger (MDACC) and
obtained in 2012. Human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells were obtained from Lonza in
2012. Details of propagation and genetic modification are described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. All cell line identities were validated by STR DNA fingerprinting in
2012, at the time of the study, using the AmpF_STR Identifier kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, cat #4322288). The STR profiles were
compared to known ATCC fingerprints (ATCC.org), and to the Cell Line Integrated
Molecular Authentication database (CLIMA) version 0.1.200808 (19). The STR profiles
matched known DNA fingerprints.
T-cell modification and culture

Author Manuscript

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were purchased from Gulf
Coast Regional Blood Bank and isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) and
cryopreserved. T cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (HyClone) supplemented with 10% FBS
(HyClone) and 2mM Glutamax (Gibco). Electro-transfer of SB plasmids coding for CAR is
detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods and as previously described (16).
Surface immunostaining and flow cytometry
Data were collected on FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (version
3.3, BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version x.0.6, TreeStar). Up to
106 cells were stained with mAbs (Supplementary Table S1) in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS,

0.5% sodium azide) for 30 minutes in the dark at 4°C. Quantitative flow cytometry was
performed using Quantum Simply Cellular polystyrene beads, according to manufacturer’s
instructions (cat #814, Bangs Laboratories) using mAb specific for EGFR (cat #555997, BD
Biosciences). A standard curve relating MFI to EGFR molecules/cell was made using
QuickCal Data Analysis Program (version 2.3, Bangs Laboratories). EGFR molecules/cell
was calculated by subtracting MFI of isotype antibody from MFI of EGFR and extrapolating
from standard curve.
Intracellular cytokine production

Author Manuscript

T cells were co-cultured with target cells at a ratio of 1:1 for 4–6 hours in the presence of
GolgiStop diluted 1:4,000 (cat #554724, BD Biosciences). T cells treated with Leukocyte
Activation Cocktail (cat #550583, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:1,000 served as positive
control. An EGFR-specific mAb (clone LA1, Millipore) was used to block binding of CAR+
T cells with EGFR on target cells at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. Following incubation,
surface staining and intracellular cytokine staining were performed using Cytofix/Cytoperm
Fixation and Permeabilization kit (cat #554714, BD Biosciences) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Phospho-flow cytometry
T cells were co-cultured with target cells at a ratio of 1:1 for 45 minutes, then lysed and
fixed using PhosFlow Lyse/Fix buffer (cat #558049, BD Biosciences), detailed in
Supplementary Materials and Methods, and analyzed via flow cytometry.
Measurement of down regulation of CAR expression

Author Manuscript

T cells and targets were mixed at a 1:1 ratio in a 12-well plate and CAR surface expression
was measured by flow cytometry at each time point. T cells plated without targets served as
negative controls. Percent down regulation of CAR was calculated as: (stimulated CAR
expression)/(unstimulated CAR expression) × 100.
Chromium release assay
Specific cytotoxicity was assessed via standard 4-hour chromium release assay, as
previously described (16).
Evaluation of T-cell efficacy in intracranial glioma xenograft

Author Manuscript

Animal experiments were carried out under regulation from the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at MDACC (ACUF 11-11-13131). Female NOD.CgPrkdcscidIL2Rγtm1Wjl/Sz (NSG, Jackson Laboratory) mice aged 6–8 weeks were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of cocktail of 10 mg/mL ketamine and 0.5 mg/mL
xylazine dosed at 0.1 mL/10 grams. Implantation of guide-screw was performed is detailed
in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Two weeks following guide-screw implantation,
250,000 U87-ffLuc-mKate or U87med-ffLuc-mKate cells were implanted through guide
screw in 5 μL PBS. Burden of intracranial glioma was serially imaged using Xenogen IVIS
Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences,) 10 minutes after sub-cutaneous injection of 215μg Dluciferin potassium salt (cat #122796, Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor flux (photons/s/cm2/

in a delineated region encompassing entire cranial region. Mice were stratified into three
groups to evenly distribute tumor burden based on BLI measurements 4 days after tumor
injection and treated with 4×106 T cells administered once a week for three weeks through
the guide-screw in 5 μL of PBS. Mice were sacrificed when they displayed progressive
weight loss (>25% loss), rapid weight loss (>10% loss within 48 hours), hind limb paralysis,
or any two of the following clinical symptoms of illness: ataxia, hunched posture, irregular
respiration rate, ulceration of exposed tumor, or palpable tumor diameter exceeding 1.5 cm.
Statistical Analyses

Author Manuscript

Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism, version 6.03. Statistical analyses of
in vitro assays were undertaken by two-way ANOVA with donor-matching and Sidak’s or
Tukey’s post-test for multiple comparisons or two-tailed student’s t-test, as indicated in
figure legends. Correlation of T-cell effector functions with EGFR density was performed
by one-way ANOVA with post-test for linear trend. Analyses of in vivo bioluminescent
imaging of tumor were performed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and
Sidak’s post-test for multiple comparisons. Survival of mice was performed by log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) test. Significance of findings defined as follows: ns = not significant, p>0.05,
* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, **** p <0.0001.

RESULTS
Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells are phenotypically similar

Author Manuscript

Cetux-CAR and Nimo-CAR were generated in Sleeping Beauty (SB) vectors
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) expressed in T cells via electroporation, and propagated by
weekly stimulations with EGFR+ activating and propagating cells (AaPC) (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Cetux- and Nimo-CAR+ T cells expanded ~1,000-fold over 28 days (Fig. 1A).
There was no difference in the kinetics or number of resultant T cells (p = 0.92), and similar
CAR expression (Cetux-CAR = 91 ± 6%, Nimo-CAR = 91 ± 6%; mean ± SD, n=7) (Fig.
1B). The density of CAR expression, represented by median fluorescence intensity, was
statistically similar on Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T-cell populations (Cetux-CAR = 119
± 25 arbitrary units (A.U.), Nimo-CAR = 113 ± 21 A.U.; mean ± SD, n=7, p = 0.74) (Fig.
1C). While individual donors yielded variable proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(Supplementary Table S2), there was no statistical difference in the CD4/CD8 ratio between
Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells (p = 0.44) (Fig. 1D). Expression of cell-surface
markers associated with T-cell differentiation (CD45RO, CD45RA, CD28, CD27, CCR7,
CD62L, CD57, KLRG1, and PD-1) were not significantly different (p > 0.05) (Fig. 1E, F).

Author Manuscript

To verify Cetux-CAR and Nimo-CAR were functional in response to EGFR stimulation, we
measured production of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ in response to A431, an
epidermoid carcinoma cell line expressing ~1×106 molecules of EGFR/cell (20). Both
Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells produced IFN-γ in response to A431 and production
was titrated in response to an EGFR-blocking antibody (clone LA1, Millipore) with an
overlapping epitope (Fig. 2B, C). Reduction in IFN-γ production by Nimo-CAR+ T cells
was observed at lower concentrations of antibody than Cetux-CAR+ T cells, supporting

differences in scFv binding affinity are preserved in CAR structure. Cetux-CAR+ and NimoCAR+ T cells both lysed A431 cells, however, neither population significantly lysed
EGFRneg NALM-6 cells (Fig. 2D). Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells are phenotypically
similar, including percentage and density of CAR expression, and are activated upon
encounter with EGFR.
Nimo-CAR+ T cells have impaired response to low density EGFR

We next determined if affinity of scFv within the CARs could impact effector functions of
genetically modified T cells as a function of density of EGFR expression. The activation of
Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells in response to EL4 cell line genetically modified to
express tEGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1C) at a low density, similar to normal human
fibroblasts (21), (Fig. 3A), and compared to T-cell activation by EL4 cells capable of crosslinking CARs independently of scFv through expression of CAR-L, an activating scFv of
mAb specific for the IgG4-derived domain of CAR (17). A similar proportion of CetuxCAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells produced IFN-γ in response to CAR-L+ EL4, (p > 0.05)
(Fig. 3B). While Cetux-CAR+ T cells increased IFN-γ production in response to tEGFR+
EL4 relative to tCD19+ EL4 (%IFN-γ, p<0.0001; MFI IFN-γ, p<0.01), Nimo-CAR+ T cells
did not (%IFN-γ, p>0.05, MFI IFN-γ, p>0.05). There was no statistical difference in
activation as assessed by phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (p > 0.05) or p38 (p > 0.05) between
Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells in response to CAR-L+ EL4 (Fig. 3C). In contrast,
Cetux-CAR+ T cells exhibited phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38 in response to tEGFR+
EL4, while Nimo-CAR+ T cells did not. Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells demonstrated
equivalent specific lysis against CAR-L+ EL4 (10:1 E:T ratio, Cetux-CAR = 65 ± 7%,
Nimo-CAR = 58 ± 13%, mean ± SD, n=4, p>0.05) (Fig. 3D). However, differences were
observed in capacity to lyse tEGFR+ EL4, where Cetux-CAR+ T cells demonstrated
significant lysis of tEGFR+ EL4 compared to irrelevant antigen (tEGFR+EL4 = 58 ± 9%,
tCD19+EL4 = 17 ± 13%, mean ± SD, n=4; p < 0.0001) and Nimo-CAR+ T cells did not
(tEGFR+EL4 = 21 ± 17%, CD19+EL4 = 12 ± 13%, mean ± SD, n=4, p > 0.05). These data
demonstrate that both CARs are capable of activating T cells when triggered outside of
scFv, yet differ in ability to activate T cells to low density EGFR.
Nimo-CAR+ T cell activation is positively correlated with EGFR density

Author Manuscript

We sought to further evaluate the impact of TAA density on activation of CAR T cells in a
single cellular background by modifying U87 cells to express varied levels of EGFR,
reflective of densities found in glioblastoma cell lines (22) (Fig. 4A): unmodified parental
U87, U87low, U87med, and U87high. Phosphorylation Erk1/2 and p38 in Cetux-CAR+ T cells
exhibited no correlation with density of EGFR expression (one-way ANOVA with post-test
for linear trend; Erk1/2, p = 0.88; p38, p = 0.09) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, phosphorylation of
Erk1/2 and p38 by Nimo-CAR+ T cells positively correlated with EGFR expression (oneway ANOVA with post-test for linear trend; Erk1/2, p = 0.003 and p38, p = 0.004). We also
noted that Nimo-CAR+ T cells demonstrated significantly less phosphorylation of Erk1/2
and p38 compared with Cetux-CAR+ T cells, even in response to high EGFR density on
U87high (Erk1/2, p < 0.0001; p38, p < 0.01). Percentage and magnitude IFN-γ production by
Cetux-CAR+ T cells did not correlate with EGFR density on target cells (one-way ANOVA
with post-test for linear trend; %IFN-γ, p = 0.5703; MFI, p = 0.9508) (Fig. 4C). In contrast,

both proportion of Nimo-CAR+ T cells producing IFN-γ and magnitude of production
directly correlated with increasing EGFR density (one-way ANOVA with post-test for linear
trend; %IFN-γ, p = 0.0124; MFI, p = 0.0175). Production of TNF-α by Cetux-CAR+ T cells
and Nimo-CAR+ T cells showed a similar trend (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Lastly, CetuxCAR+ T cells demonstrated significantly increased specific lysis of both parental U87 (10:1
E:T ratio, p < 0.0001) and U87low (10:1 E:T ratio, p < 0.05) targets compared with reduced
killing by Nimo-CAR+ T cells. However, there was statistically similar lysis by T cells
expressing both CAR designs targeting U87med (10:1 E:T ratio, p>0.05) and U87high (10:1
E:T ratio, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4D). These data were verified using cell lines with naturally varied
EGFR expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). We investigated the ability of CAR T cells to be
activated by low density EGFR on normal human renal cortical epithelial cells (HRCE),
which express ~15,000 molecules of EGFR/cell (Fig. 4E). Cetux-CAR+ T cells produced
IFN-γ in response to HRCE (%IFN-γ, p < 0.05; MFI, p < 0.01) whereas Nimo-CAR+ T cells
did not (%IFN-γ, p > 0.05; MFI, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4F). Similarly, Cetux-CAR+ T cells, but not
Nimo-CAR+ T cells, produced TNF-α in response to HRCE (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In
summary, Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells were both activated by target cells
expressing high EGFR density, but only Nimo-CAR+ T cells showed diminished activity in
response to low EGFR density. These observations support the premise that activation of
Nimo-CAR+ T cells, in contrast to Cetux-CAR+ T cells, is dependent on density of EGFR
expression.
Increasing duration of interaction does not restore Nimo-CAR+ T-cell response to low
EGFR density

Author Manuscript

Because low-affinity TCR-mediated responses may be activated by prolonged interaction
with antigen in context of MHC (23,24), we extended the duration of interaction of NimoCAR+ T cells with targets to 24 hours, based on demonstrations of saturated maximal killing
at this time point in non-radioactive lysis assays (25,26). Over 24 hours of interaction,
Nimo-CAR+ T cells failed to significantly produce IFN-γ in response to U87, however,
maintained similar IFN-γ production to Cetux-CAR+ T cells in response to U87high (Fig.
5A). Furthermore, Cetux-CAR+ and Nimo-CAR+ T cells demonstrated a statistically similar
ability to control the growth of U87high tumor cells in long-term co-culture, however NimoCAR+ T cells were unable to control parental U87 growth (Fig. 5B). While Cetux-CAR+ T
cells demonstrated moderate, similar proliferation in response to U87 and U87high, NimoCAR+ T cells demonstrated significantly higher proliferation in response to U87high cells
than parental U87 (Fig. 5C). In aggregate, these data show that reduced activation of NimoCAR+ T cells to low density EGFR is not restored by increasing duration of interaction.

Cetux-CAR exhibits enhanced down regulation upon EGFR docking
The cell surface expression of endogenous TCR and CAR may be decreased following
interaction with antigen, and for endogenous TCR, the degree of down regulation is
correlated with the strength of TCR binding (27). We investigated whether Cetux-CAR+ and
Nimo-CAR+ T cells have a differing propensities for TAA-induced down regulation. When
co-cultured with parental U87, Cetux-CAR was reduced from T-cell surface after 12 hours
and returned by 48 hours, but expression of Nimo-CAR did not appreciably reduce from the
cell surface (Fig. 5D). In response to high EGFR density on U87high, Cetux-CAR was

significantly reduced after 12 hours of co-culture and remained reduced over 48 hours.
Again, Nimo-CAR did not appreciably downregulate (12 hours; Cetux-CAR = 37 ± 12%,
Nimo-CAR= 124 ± 15%, mean ± SD, n=3). Cetux-CAR was detectable within T cells when
reduced from the T-cell surface, demonstrating that reduced CAR expression was due to
internalization of CAR and not outgrowth of genetically unmodified T cells (Fig. 5E).
Similarly, when stimulated with tEGFR+ EL4, Cetux-CAR is reduced from T-cell surface,
but Nimo-CAR is not, and both CARs are down-regulated to a similar degree when
stimulated with CAR-L+ EL4 (Supplementary Fig. S4). To determine if down-regulation of
CAR impacts subsequent activation to antigen, we re-challenged CAR+ T cells after initial
encounter with EGFR. While Cetux-CAR+ T cells had reduced production of IFN-γ, NimoCAR+ T cells retained IFN-γ production in response to re-challenge with the glioma cells
expressing low and high levels of EGFR (Fig. 5F). Thus, downregulation of CAR is function
of affinity and antigen density, enabling Nimo-CAR+ T cells to maintain function to
repeated challenge with elevated levels of EGFR, while Cetux-CAR+ T cells have reduced
capacity to respond to under conditions of serial stimulation.
Nimo- and Cetux-CAR+ T cells inhibit high-density EGFR+ glioma growth in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because glioma cell lines express a median density of 240,000 molecules of EGFR/cell (22),
U87med expressing ~340,000 molecules of EGFR/cell modified to co-express ffLuc-mKate
were established as intracranial tumors in NSG mice to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy. Mice
were stratified to receive no treatment, Cetux-CAR+ T cells, or Nimo-CAR+ T cells to
evenly distribute relative tumor burden (Supplementary Fig. S5A). CAR+ T cells were
infused once a week for 3 weeks and relative tumor growth was monitored by BLI. CAR
expression was similar Cetux-CAR+ T cells and Nimo-CAR+ T cells prior to infusion
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Cetux-CAR+ T cells and Nimo-CAR+ T cells both significantly
inhibited tumor growth (day 18; Cetux-CAR, p < 0.01 and Nimo-CAR, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A,
B) and were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Mice receiving Cetux-CAR+ T cells
exhibited toxicity manifested as rapid weight loss and lethargy, resulting in significant death
of mice within 7 days of T-cell infusion. (6/14 mice, p = 0.0006; Fig. 6C). Overall, adoptive
transfer of Cetux-CAR+ T cells did not statistically improve survival compared to untreated
mice (untreated median survival = 88 days, Cetux-CAR median survival = 105 days, p =
0.19) (Fig. 6D). When only considering mice surviving 7 days after Cetux-CAR+ T cell
infusion, we noted improvement in survival of 75% of mice (p = 0.0065 relative to untreated
mice). In contrast, Nimo-CAR+ T cells mediated effective tumor regression and extended
survival in 4/7 of mice without apparent toxicity (untreated median survival = 88 days,
Nimo-CAR median survival = 158 days, p = 0.0269). Following 225 days, 2/7 mice in each
treatment group were still living. These results demonstrate that Cetux-CAR+ T cells and
Nimo-CAR+ T cells are both capable of controlling glioma with an intermediate density of
EGFR.
Nimo-CAR+ T cells exhibit impaired targeting of low-density EGFR+ cells in vivo
We next sought to determine whether CAR+ T cells might exhibit a potential for undesired
targeting of low EGFR density, by using parental U87 cells with low EGFR expression as a
mimic for normal cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Treatment of mice with Cetux-CAR+ T
cells resulted in significant reduction of U87 cells compared to untreated mice (day 25, p <

receiving no treatment (untreated median survival = 38.5 days, Cetux-CAR median survival
= 53 days, p = 0.015; Fig. 7C). In contrast, administration of Nimo-CAR+ T cells did not
significantly impact the growth of U87 compared to untreated mice (Nimo-CAR, p > 0.05)
and thus did not significantly improve survival (untreated median survival 38.5 days, NimoCAR median survival 46 days, p = 0.0969). These data demonstrate that Nimo-CAR+ T
cells, in contrast to Cetux-CAR+ T cells, do not mediate significant activity against parental
U87 in vivo, which serve as a surrogate for normal tissue, demonstrating an effector profile
consistent with reduced ability to target EGFR on normal cells.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Aberrantly-expressed antigens on tumors, such as EGFR on glioblastoma, can be
overexpressed relative to lower, basal levels on normal tissues. Taking advantage of this
observation, we tuned CAR affinity to activate T cells based on the density of EGFR
expression and demonstrated that a CAR with reduced affinity rendered T cells
preferentially activated by high, but not low, density of EGFR. Our approach was based on
the clinical toxicity exhibited by cetuximab and nimotuzumab, which recognize overlapping
epitopes and exhibit different kinetics of binding to EGFR (13,14). The lower affinity of
nimotuzumab has been credited with absence of adverse events relative to cetuximab (15).
Indeed, we revealed that a CAR species recognizing EGFR via the scFv derived from
nimotuzumab exhibited a gradient of T-cell activation that directly correlated with density of
expression of EGFR. In fact, as predicted by studies with nimotuzumab, Nimo-CAR+ T cells
exhibited no apparent T-cell activation (absence of phosphorylation of MAP kinase
molecules and cytokine production) in response to densities of EGFR found on normal
tissues.
There are few studies addressing the role of scFv affinity in the therapeutic aptitude of CAR
designs. Most recently, and in support of our findings, an EGFRvIII-specific CAR with
reduced affinity has been reported with reduced binding to wild type EGFR, and therefore
reduced potential for normal tissue toxicity (28). A ROR1-specific CAR with increased
affinity resulted in augmented T-cell function in response to TAA, which led to superior
anti-tumor activity in vivo (29). Our study supports these findings in the situation of low
antigen density on target cells, however, when antigen density is high on target cells, we
found no benefit of increased scFv affinity. A series of CARs derived from a panel of
HER2-specific mAbs with a range of Kd values demonstrated that the affinity of CAR above
a minimum threshold required for activation did not improve T-cell response to targets with
a range of HER2 densities (30).

While the affinity constant (Kd) is one measure used to describe the functional affinity of a
CAR species, the relative contributions of on- and off-rates may account for disparate
findings between these studies, as is likely the case with αβ TCR affinity in governing
endogenous T-cell responses (31,32). The reduced affinity constant of nimotuzumab is most
impacted by a reduced on-rate of binding, requiring at least bivalent interaction to bind to
target cells, which is more likely to occur in the presence of high antigen density. Thus, the
capacity of the CAR to bind antigen at differing densities likely accounts for the superior

ability of Cetux-CAR compared with Nimo-CAR to recognize low density EGFR.
Nimotuzumab and cetuximab bind highly overlapping epitopes, making it unlikely that
magnitude of differences in CAR function are due solely to differences in epitope location;
however, the contribution of this factor cannot be excluded.

Author Manuscript

Two parameters of TCR binding have been described that contribute to T-cell functional
avidity: quality (binding affinity) and quantity (number of receptors engaged) (12,33).
Increasing quantity of lower affinity TCRs can restore some T-cell functions, but not all,
highlighting that some functions are dependent on quality versus quantity of activation
signal. We observed a distinction between the quality and quantity of signaling mediated by
Cetux-CAR versus Nimo-CAR. Nimo-CAR+ T cells docking with glioma cells expressing
high EGFR density demonstrated reduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38 compared to
Cetux-CAR+ T cells, in spite of equivalent phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38 in response to
CAR-L+ EL4, yet maintained comparable functional responses. Because low affinity TCRs
can signal through transient, undetectable phosphorylation intermediates to culminate in
functional T-cell response, it is possible a similar mechanism is responsible for this
observation in Nimo-CAR+ T cells (23).

Author Manuscript

High affinity TCRs and CARs can elicit impaired functional T cell responses, due to
prolonged interactions prohibiting serial triggering, which is necessary to generate a fully
functional T cell response (34–37). In CAR-modified T cells, however, the requirement for
serial triggering has been overcome by expressing CAR at higher densities, reducing the
need for serial triggering to activate T cells. Thus, any theoretical impairment of Cetux-CAR
function due to its high affinity may be masked by expression at high density on T cells. We
observed that Cetux-CAR was less capable of mounting a T-cell response upon re-exposure
to EGFR, which was predicted by the down-regulation of Cetux-CAR after initial docking
with EGFR. Similarly, Cetux-CAR+ T cells exhibited less proliferative capacity than NimoCAR+ T cells in response to high EGFR density. Signaling through engineered and
endogenous TCRs of high affinity has been reported to cause functional anergy in T cells
(38–40), so whether a reduced secondary response of Cetux-CAR+ T cells is due to loss of
CAR and/or functional anergy remains to be elucidated.

Author Manuscript

Because cetuximab and nimotuzumab do not cross-react with murine EGFR, we measured
deleterious binding of CAR+ T cells to low density EGFR based upon implantation of
parental U87 cells, which express low levels of EGFR and thus serve as a surrogate for
normal human cells. We observed that adoptive transfer of Cetux-CAR+ T cells, but not
Nimo-CAR+ T cells, could control growth of parental U87 cells. Therefore, T cells
expressing a CAR with increased affinity for EGFR are likely to result in recognition of low
levels of EGFR expression in vitro and in vivo leading to on-target, off-tissue toxicity. It is
possible that Nimo-CAR+ T cells may result in outgrowth of low density EGFR tumor
escape variants, as described in studies with other CARs targeting GBM-associated antigens
(41). Computational modeling based on extent and intensity of multiple antigens expressed
on resected patient GBMs can inform design of a combination therapy utilizing CARs with
multiple specificities to overcome this limitation.

Alternative approaches exist for reducing or avoiding the potential for CAR-mediated
toxicity to TAA expressed on normal tissues. Expression of CAR from introduced mRNA
species or activation of a suicide switch to result in death of infused T cells temporally limit
CAR+ T cell presence to reduce toxicity, but both permanently negate CAR T cell function
and may undermine therapeutic efficacy (42–45). Limiting T-cell activation to CAR binding
malignant cells can be achieved by co-expression of CARs with dissociated signaling
domains targeting TAA only mutually expressed on malignant cells, such that binding of
both CARs is needed to achieve a fully-competent T-cell activation signal (46–48).
However, requirement for expression of two antigens for efficient T-cell activation reduces
the fraction of tumor capable of triggering CAR T cells, and a partial signal received from
interaction of one CAR with TAA on normal tissue may be sufficient to mediate toxicity.
Co-expression of a CAR activated in response to TAA and a CAR inhibitory in response to
normal tissue antigen could minimize normal tissue toxicity (49), however, careful
consideration of stoichiometric ratios of antigens on normal tissue is required. Our approach
has merit in simplicity as only one TAA is targeted.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, the weakness of the Nimo-CAR affinity is its apparent strength. Our data
support a new approach to designing genetically modified T cells to help them separate
friend from foe by tuning scFv affinity to preferentially target the increased density of TAA.
The relative inability of Nimo-CAR+ T cells to control U87 xenografts with low EGFR
density in vivo combined with in vitro evidence that Nimo-CAR+ T cells are not activated in
the presence of low density EGFR suggest that Nimo-CAR+ T cells are favorably impaired
in their ability to damage normal cells, especially relative to Cetux-CAR+ T cells. We
cannot eliminate the possibility of Nimo-CAR+ T cells mediating some degree of on-target,
off-tissue toxicity, therefore, initial clinical evaluation of Nimo-CAR+ T cells should be
undertaken with suicide genes in patients with high-grade glioma via \ intracranial delivery
of T cells as the central nervous system lacks notable EGFR expression (9), and may be
extended to other cancers overexpressing EGFR, including bladder, cervical, esophageal,
head and neck squamous cell, ovarian, breast, colorectal, gastric, endometrial, and non-small
lung cell carcinomas (50).

U87high cells remaining after co-culture with Cetux-CAR+ or Nimo-CAR+ T cells. U87 cell
lines were co-cultured with CAR+ T cells at an E:T ratio of 1:5 in triplicate. Percent
surviving was calculated as [cell number harvested after co-culture]/[cell number without T
cells]*100. Data represented as mean ± SD, n=3, *** p<0.001, two-way ANOVA (Sidak’s
post-test). (C) Proliferation of CAR+ T cells measured by intracellular flow cytometry for
Ki-67 in CD8+ gated T cells following 36 hours of co-culture. Data represented as mean

Nimo- and Cetux-CAR+ T cells inhibit high-density EGFR+ glioma growth in vivo. (A)
Serial BLI assessed relative size of tumor (introduced on day 0). (B) Relative tumor growth
as assessed by serial BLI of tumor. Background luminescence (gray shading) was defined by
BLI of mice with no tumors. Significant difference in BLI between mice with no treatment
vs. treatment (n=7) with Cetux-CAR+ T cells (n=7, p < 0.01) and no treatment (n=7) vs.
treatment with Nimo-CAR+ T cells (n=7, p < 0.05) at day 18, two-way ANOVA (Sidak’s
post-test). (C) Survival of mice with U87med-ffLuc-mKate intracranial xenografts from two
independent experiments within 7 days of T-cell administration. Significant reduction in
survival in Cetux-CAR+ T cell treated mice 8/14 surviving at day 26) relative to untreated
mice (14/14 surviving at day 26) determined by Mantel-Cox log-rank test, p = 0.0006. (D)
