BACKGROUND: Increased pathologic complete response (pCR) rates observed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for some
subsets of patients with invasive breast cancer have prompted interest in whether patients who achieved a pCR can be identified preoperatively and potentially spared the morbidity of surgery. The objective of this multicenter, retrospective study was to estimate the
accuracy of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting a pCR in the breast. METHODS: MRI studies at baseline
and after the completion of NCT plus data regarding pathologic response were collected retrospectively from 746 women who
received treatment at 8 institutions between 2002 and 2011. Tumors were characterized by immunohistochemical phenotype into 4
categories based on receptor expression: hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (n ¼ 327), HR-positive/HER2-positive, (n ¼ 148), HR-negative/HER2-positive, (n ¼ 101), and triplenegative (HR-negative/HER2 negative; n ¼ 155). In all, 194 of 249 patients (78%) with HER2-positive tumors received trastuzumab.
Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with radiographic complete response (rCR) and pCR were performed.
RESULT: For the total group, the rCR and pCR rates were 182 of 746 patients (24%) and 179 of 746 patients (24%), respectively, and
the highest pCR rate was observed for the triple-negative subtype (57 of 155 patients; 37%) and the HER2-positive subtype (38 of 101
patients; 38%). The overall accuracy of MRI for predicting pCR was 74%. The variables sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive
predictive value, and accuracy differed significantly among tumor subtypes, and the greatest negative predictive value was observed
in the triple-negative (60%) and HER2-positive (62%) subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The overall accuracy of MRI for predicting pCR in
invasive breast cancer patients who were receiving NCT was 74%. The performance of MRI differed between subtypes, possibly influenced by differences in pCR rates between groups. Future studies will determine whether MRI in combination with directed core biC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is used increasingly for the treatment of invasive, high-risk breast cancer. The use of
effective first-line chemotherapeutic agents as well as targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab for human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease in the neoadjuvant setting have resulted in a high rate of pathologic complete
response (pCR) ranging from 40% to 67%, depending on the study population.1-4 It remains unknown whether excision
of the tumor bed in the setting of pCR improves the risk of locoregional recurrence; thus, there has been keen interest in

MRI As a pCR Predictor in Breast Cancer/De Los Santos et al

determining whether negative imaging after systemic therapy might identify a patient subset that could be treated
safely with radiation alone without surgery. Prior studies
evaluating radiotherapy as the definitive modality for
treating the breast in patients who have a clinical complete
response to NCT have resulted in unacceptably high
locoregional failure rates.5-7 This may be attributed
largely to poor patient selection, because it is known that
clinical examination to detect residual disease or response
is limited.8-10 A more sensitive tool for evaluating inbreast response could more effectively identify potential
candidates for radiotherapy alone after a complete
response to NCT.
One such tool is magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), which has been used with increasing frequency in
recent years because of its high sensitivity for detecting
breast cancers compared with mammography or ultrasound.11-14 The ability of a radiologic complete response
(rCR) by MRI to predict a pCR has been the subject of
active investigation. Several groups have evaluated the predictive accuracy of MRI for assessing response to NCT
and reported limited correlation between an rCR after the
completion of NCT and a pCR.13,15-17 Although the performance of MRI appeared better in some tumor phenotypes compared with others, previous small, retrospective
studies lacked the power to detect a significant difference
between clinically distinct subsets. In the current study,
we sought to determine the performance of MRI after
NCT in a larger multicenter data set to better define the
accuracy of post-treatment breast MRI in the prediction
of pCR. Moreover, we wanted to identify which tumorrelated variables were associated with the highest correlation between an rCR and a pCR to identify a patient population that may be most amenable to treatment with
whole breast radiation without surgery based on demonstrating an rCR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before and after breast MRI were retrospectively identified at 8
National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centers. Between January 2002 and February
2011, 770 women fulfilled study criteria. The identification of patients across institutions was stipulated by
cross-referencing billing codes of patients who had a
breast cancer diagnosis, received treatment with chemotherapy, and underwent imaging studies with breast MRI.
Among this group were 165 patients who were treated on
the I-SPY trials, which are prospective multicenter trials

of women who receive NCT, including radiographic and
pathologic endpoints. All participating institutions were
members of the Translational Breast Cancer Research
Consortium (TBCRC), which sponsored the study, and
included the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Duke University, the University of
Chicago, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,
and the University of California-San Francisco. Institutional review board approval for the study was obtained at
each institution. In addition to pre-NCT and post-NCT
MRI studies, eligible patients were required to have
undergone definitive surgery with pathology available for
review. Patient, tumor, and treatment-related variables
were entered into a secure, password-protected online
database. Documentation of baseline and post-treatment
images with mammography and ultrasound of the breast
and lymph nodes also were recorded.
Tumor Classification

Histologic tumor types were recorded as follows: invasive
ductal carcinoma, pure invasive lobular carcinoma, invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features, and invasive mammary carcinoma not otherwise
specified. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status (positive or negative, with positive defined
as 1% positive cells) according to percentage of positive
cells and HER2 status (positive or negative) also were collected. HER2 status was determined by local testing
according to the 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines.18 All
histopathology and biomarker assessments were performed at the individual sites. A pathologic response in
the breast was categorized as no residual invasive disease
or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); no residual invasive
cancer with DCIS present; and residual invasive disease,
including microscopic residual invasive disease.19 To
assess the primary endpoints of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) of MRI, a pCR in the breast was defined as the
resolution of both invasive disease and DCIS.
Breast Imaging

All patients were required to have both baseline and posttreatment MRI studies to be eligible for the study. At the
time of presentation, all patients in the cohort had an
enhancing lesion on MRI corresponding to the known biopsy-proven cancer. The baseline size of the lesion defined
as the maximal diameter in a single dimension on pretreatment MRI, mammogram, and ultrasound, was

(TP þ TN þ FP þ FN). The accuracy of mammography
and MRI was defined separately for each individual modality (Fig. 1). The combined accuracy of both modalities
was scored as accurate if both modalities predicted a pCR.
Comparisons of patient subsets are based on the chisquare test for contingency tables. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to examine the simultaneous effects of
multiple factors. The SAS statistical software package was
used for all analyses (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).

recorded. Radiographic tumor (T) classification was
assigned based on the largest imaging size by any modality. Patients who had unknown primary lesions were
excluded. Specific parameters for dynamic contrastenhanced breast imaging were not defined for eligibility;
however, the institutions included on this study have high
levels of expertise in breast MRI. A central review of MR
images was not performed. A complete MRI response in
the breast was defined as the resolution of all areas of
abnormal enhancement, mass, or distortion.
Systemic Treatment

All patients in the study received preoperative systemic
therapy. The number of cycles of chemotherapy before
post-treatment MRI was recorded. It was also noted
whether patients received trastuzumab, bevacizumab, or
neoadjuvant hormone therapy.
Statistical Analysis

The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of
MRI for detecting residual disease in the breast were estimated from the data with pCR defined, as discussed
above, as the complete resolution of both invasive cancer
and DCIS. True-negative (TN) was defined as negative
on both MRI and pathology; false-negative (FN) was
defined as negative on MRI but positive on pathology;
true-positive (TP) was defined as positive on both MRI
and pathology; and false-positive (FP) was defined as positive on pathology but negative on MRI. Accuracy was
defined as the percentage of test results correctly identified
by the test, ie, (TP þ TN)/total test results ¼ (TP þ TN)/
1778

Data from 770 women who received treatment at 8 tertiary NCI comprehensive cancer centers were collected.
After excluding patients who had missing data (MRI
response after NCT or final pathology), 746 patients
remained evaluable for the primary endpoint. The median
age of the cohort was 49 years (range, 20-86 years). Histologic subtype rendered on initial core biopsy was generally
representative of newly diagnosed cancers: 61% were ERpositive, 54% were PR-positive, and 34% were HER2positive. A summary of patient and tumor characteristics
is provided in Table 1.
Systemic Therapy

The most common chemotherapy regimen delivered
included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and a taxane
(51%); other regimens (35%); taxane and carboplatin
(9%); and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (5%). Five
percent of patients received bevacizumab, and 18 patients
received neoadjuvant hormone therapy only. Of 248
patients with HER2-positive breast tumors, 194 (78%)
received trastuzumab. The remaining 54 patients with
HER2-positive breast tumors were treated before 2005
and did not receive trastuzumab.
Surgery

The median interval between post-treatment scans and
surgery was 20 days. Definitive surgery was mastectomy
with or without reconstruction in 54% of women and
breast conservation in 46%. Nineteen percent underwent
sentinel lymph node biopsy before starting systemic treatment, 42% underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy as part
of definitive surgery, and 72% underwent level I or II axillary lymph node dissection.
Performance of Breast Magnetic Resonance
Imaging

Overall, post-treatment MRI detected residual disease in
the breast with 83% sensitivity, 47% specificity, a PPV of
47%, an NPV of 83%, and 74% accuracy. Table 2 also

illustrates the performance of MRI of the breast stratified
according to immunohistochemical phenotypes. There
were significant differences in sensitivity, NPV, PPV, and
accuracy among subtypes. The NPV was highest for
patients who had HR-negative/HER2-positive and triplenegative breast cancers. HER2-positive breast tumors differed according to receipt of trastuzumab (Table 3). The
addition of trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast tumors
significantly increased the rate of rCR compared with no
trastuzumab (32.5% vs 15%, respectively; P < .0001)
and was reflected in the increased rate of pCR (33.5% vs
18.5%, respectively; P ¼ .01). However, this did not
translate into a difference in the accuracy of MRI for predicting a pCR among patients.
As a secondary aim, we also assessed whether a complete response on post-NCT mammogram or ultrasound
studies (when available) in combination with MRI
increased the accuracy for predicting a pCR. The accuracy
of mammogram and MRI, separately and in combination,
for predicting a pCR is illustrated in Figure 1. A complete
response on both mammography and MRI did not significantly increase the ability to detect patients who would
achieve a pCR over MRI alone; although, as expected, an
rCR by mammography (P < .0001) or ultrasound (P <
.0001) also was associated significantly with an rCR on
MRI (data not shown). The small number of patients
who underwent imaging after treatment with all 3 modalities (MRI, mammography, and ultrasound) precluded a
formal evaluation of trimodality performance.

triple-negative immunohistochemical phenotype (Table
1). On univariate analysis, race was associated with pCR
but not with rCR. HER2-positive breast tumors had a
trend toward an increased rCR rate (P ¼ .05). Treatment
regimens that were associated with the highest rates of rCR
included taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel)/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (P < .0001) and the receipt of trastuzumab-containing regimens among women with HER2positive breast tumors (P ¼ .0001). Tumor size on pretreatment MRI was also evaluated as a continuous variable to
determine whether a significant cutoff for rCR could be
determined. Patients who had tumors 5 cm in greatest
dimension on a y pretreatment MRI had a greater chance
of obtaining an rCR (P ¼ .09) and for achieving a pCR in
those who achieved an rCR (P ¼ .06), although these
findings did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2).

that significantly influenced rCR and pCR was performed

associated independently with rCR included triple-negative or HER2-positive tumor subtype (P ¼ .03) and lower
T classification at presentation (P ¼ .002). Variables that
were associated independently with the likelihood of
attaining a pCR were triple-negative or HER2-positive tumor subtype (P < .0001), lower T classification (P ¼
.01), and African American race (P ¼ .0003).

DISCUSSION
The increasingly high rate of pCR in some subsets of
patients who receive NCT for invasive breast cancer has
raised the question of whether patients who achieve a
pCR require surgical resection of the tumor bed or
whether the breast can be appropriately managed with
radiation therapy alone.17 However, the safe omission of
surgery in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy and
achieve an rCR depends on the ability to accurately estimate pCR preoperatively. MRI has an increased sensitivity for detecting residual disease in the breast compared
with either mammography or ultrasound, making it a
potentially useful tool in this setting.20-25 The performance of MRI in predicting a pCR in women with breast
cancer who receive NCT has been the topic of several
publications over the past several years.12,14,15,17,26-36
Those trials mostly included small single-institution studies, which reported that post-treatment MRI correlated
more closely with final pathology than with physical examination, mammography, or ultrasound. However, a
broad range of predictive accuracy (58%-93%) was
reported. One of the best characterized studies is the ISPY 1 trial,29-31,37 in which the investigators observed
that, in 216 evaluable patients, MRI findings were a better
indicator of a pathologic response to NCT than clinical
assessment.30 However, the I-SPY 1 trial was underpowered to detect significant differences between subsets.
The objective of the current analysis was to inform
the feasibility of using MRI in-breast response in a prospective trial, omitting breast surgery and using radiotherapy alone, in patients who achieved an rCR after NCT.
Because the omission of surgery in patients who have an
rCR would not be considered feasible if residual DCIS
remained in the breast, we defined a pCR as the resolution
of both invasive disease and DCIS. This definition of
pCR has also been associated with an improvement in disease-free survival compared with patients who have resolution of invasive disease but with residual DCIS in the
breast after NCT.19 We also wanted to determine whether
there were differences in the accuracy of MRI between tumor subtypes.
Cancer

We observed a statistically significant difference in
MRI sensitivity, NPV, PPV, and accuracy for detecting a
pCR among different immunohistochemical phenotypes
when pCR was defined according to either the standard
definition of resolution of invasive disease only (data not
shown) or more rigorously as the resolution of both invasive disease and DCIS. Previous trials have suggested
differences in the performance of MRI among different
immunohistochemical phenotypes.15,31,33,38 We confirmed that, among patients who achieved an rCR, positive HR status and low tumor grade were most commonly
associated with residual disease at surgery, suggesting that
an rCR on preoperative MRI in these patient populations
should be interpreted with caution. However, it is important to note that differences in NPV, PPV, and accuracy
among phenotype subsets are impacted by variations in
the prevalence of pCR among subtypes. Similarly, comparisons indicating significant differences among variables
for rCR are reflective of disease sensitivity to NCT rather
than differing MR assessment quality across these subtypes. Although it is retrospective, to our knowledge, the
current study represents the single largest analysis to date
addressing this question.
There are several important limitations to note. Our
study did not include either a central radiology review or a
central pathology review. However, data collection was
performed across 8 NCI comprehensive cancer centers,
each with substantial expertise in MRI techniques and
interpretation as well as significant expertise in surgical
breast pathology. Our goal was to create a data set that
was generalizable across different situations and institutions, and the endpoints chosen were objective and unambiguous, minimizing potential for subjective bias. In
addition, we did not collect data on markers of proliferation, such as Ki-67, that would allow further characterization of ER-positive tumors into luminal A and B subtypes
and would facilitate analyses of differences between these
subsets in imaging accuracy. Finally, the specificities of
the MR coil strength, contrast type, and infusion protocol
for every institution were not collected in this retrospective study; and, indeed, they changed over time at each
institution. Although these limitations should be
acknowledged, they nevertheless allow for greater generalizability of our findings across many different clinical
settings.
In this study, the addition of mammographic rCR
to MRI in a subset of patients did not improve the ability
to detect residual microscopic disease. The role of ultrasound could not be evaluated, because few patients in the
cohort underwent post-treatment ultrasound in addition
1781

to MRI. Although our findings emphasize that an rCR
based on MRI alone is not sufficient to reliably rule out residual disease, it nevertheless remains a useful and sensitive imaging modality in this setting, particularly among
certain breast cancer subtypes.
In conclusion, the accuracy of breast MRI was 74%
for predicting a pCR in patients who received preoperative chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer. Sensitivity,
NPV, PPV, and accuracy of MRI for predicting a pCR
differed significantly among molecular breast cancer subtypes, and the highest NPV was among the HR-negative/
HER2-positive (62%) and triple-negative (60%) phenotypes. The observed NPV of MRI overall after neoadjuvant systemic therapy does not support using MRI alone
to accurately identify patients who may be candidates for
a study of radiation alone in the context of a clinical trial.
However, the high sensitivity of MRI, particularly in HRnegative and HER2-positive phenotypes, supports its
potential role in a prospective trial to evaluate the omission of surgery in women who achieve an rCR after NCT,
possibly in combination with other tests, such as tumor
bed biopsy.
