BACKGROUND: There are currently no systemic treatments for stage IV melanoma, which have been proven in randomized trials to benefit overall survival (OS). Lenalidomide has efficacy against melanoma in
animal models and safety in phase 1 trials. The authors reported the results of a phase 2/3 study comparing
the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed metastatic melanoma disease
refractory to previous treatment with dacarbazine, temozolomide, interleukin-2, or interferon-a. METHODS:
A total of 294 patients were randomized to oral lenalidomide at 5 mg or 25 mg dose. Tumor response, time
to progression, and OS were evaluated. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable
adverse events. RESULTS: No significant differences in response rate, OS, or time to progression were
observed between lenalidomide 25 mg versus 5 mg (overall response rate: 5.5% vs 3.4%, P ¼ .38; median
OS: 6.8 months vs 7.2 months, P ¼ .71; and median time to progression: 2.2 months vs 1.9 months, P ¼ .24).
Myelosuppression was observed in 37.0% of patients in the 25 mg group and 13.7% of patients in the 5 mg
group. Treatment-related serious adverse events were seen in 39.0% of patients at the 25 mg dose and
35.4% of patients at the 5 mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of treatment-related serious
adverse events, 80% of patients continued treatment. The higher dose of lenalidomide did not improve
response rate, time to progression, or OS of patients with relapsed/refractory stage IV melanoma. A parallel placebo-controlled study has been conducted to further assess the efficacy of lenalidomide in stage IV

Lenalidomide Dose Evaluation in Melanoma/Glaspy et al

When it is diagnosed early, melanoma is characterized by a high cure rate by surgical resection. However,
once distant metastases/stage IV disease is documented
the prognosis is poor, with a median survival rate of 6-8
months and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%.3,4 There
is some evidence that a minority of patients with stage IV
disease treated with high doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2)
have long-term survival (7%). For this reason, IL-2 treatment is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this population; however, the high level of
toxicity limits its application.5 Although surgery can have
a role in some patients with stage IV disease, for most the
presence of multiple metastatic sites and/or comorbidities
limits the applicability of this approach.6,7 Consequently,
most patients with stage IV melanoma are currently
treated with either dacarbazine or temozolomide, or with
supportive care alone.7,8 Neither dacarbazine nor highdose IL-2 has been proven in randomized clinical trials to
produce an overall survival (OS) benefit.7,8 Furthermore,
in a phase 3 trial of intravenous dacarbazine versus oral
temozolomide in advanced metastatic melanoma patients,
temozolomide was as effective as dacarbazine with a median OS of 7.7 months compared with 6.4 months for
dacarbazine.9
Some potential new therapies that target specific signaling pathways involved in the progression of metastatic
melanoma have been tested in clinical trials. These
include the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib, the angiogenesis inhibitor ABT-510,
and the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide.10-16
None of these drugs have exhibited a higher response rate
than treatment with dacarbazine or IL-2, and no treatment has been established to increase median OS.7 Thus,
new systemic treatments for patients with stage IV melanoma are urgently needed. Currently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends enrollment in a
clinical trial, over other existing treatments, as either firstline therapy or second-line therapy for patients with unresectable stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma.7,17
Lenalidomide has shown antitumor activity against
metastatic malignant melanoma in an animal model.18
The safety and tolerability of this drug were demonstrated
in phase 1 studies, which also indicated the possibility of
clinical activity of lenalidomide in the treatment of refractory metastatic malignant melanoma.19,20 Here, we report

the results from a phase 2/3 trial, MEL-001. The objective
of MEL-001 was to compare the efficacy and safety of
lenalidomide 5 mg with 25 mg in the treatment of
patients with stage IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed after treatment with dacarbazine, temozolomide,
IL-2, or interferon (IFN)-a.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
MEL-001 was an international, multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, dose-evaluating, parallel-group study. The
protocols were designed in accordance with the general
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Institutional review boards or ethics committees at each
participating center approved the study protocol. Patients
from Canada and the United States were enrolled in the
study. All patients provided written informed consent. All
eligible patients who signed an informed consent were
admitted to the study. Patients were randomized using an
Interactive Voice Response System. Data from all
randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of lenalidomide were included in the safety analyses. Response
was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST). The response assessment was
scheduled for the fourth week of the second cycle. Disease
progression was defined according to the RECIST criteria. Adverse events were graded according to National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC)
version 2.

Patient Selection
Adult patients aged 18 years with stage IV melanoma
were selected. A total of 294 subjects were enrolled as the
intent-to-treat population. All patients had to have
relapsed or refractory disease after treatment with dacarbazine, temozolomide, IL-2, and/or IFN-a for stage IIIb,
IIIc, or IV disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 2. Patients were
excluded if they had received cancer treatments within the
preceding 28 days, were pregnant, had serious mental illness, significant comorbid disease, HIV, hepatitis, or
hypersensitivity to thalidomide, known brain metastases,
or had been treated previously with lenalidomide.

FIGURE 1. Patient flow is illustrated with. *Study Arm A ¼ 5 mg lenalidomide and Study Arm B ¼ 25 mg lenalidomide. ITT indicates intent to treat.

Treatment
Based on previously published prognostic indicators for
metastatic malignant melanoma,21 patients were stratified for randomization based on the following variables:
gender, ECOG performance status, metastatic sites of
stage IV melanoma (M1: metastases to skin, subcutaneous tissue, or distant lymph nodes; M2: metastases to
lung; and M3: metastases to all other visceral sites),22
serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum albumin,
alkaline phosphatase, and platelet count. Patients in
study arm A were treated with oral lenalidomide 5 mg
plus placebo, looking identical to the 25 mg dose,
administered daily for 28 days. Patients in study arm B
were treated with oral lenalidomide 25 mg administered
for 21 days of every 28 days and placebo for the remaining 7 days. Pill distribution was administered in a double-blind fashion as same number and pill appearance for
all subjects in study, regardless of dose. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable adverse
events. Concurrent treatment with filgrastim for neutropenia was recommended, and patients received full supportive care, including transfusions, antibiotics, and
antiemetics, when appropriate. Patients were monitored
for adverse events and treatment withheld for serious
adverse events (NCI-CTC grade 3 or higher nonhematological events and grade 4 or higher hematological
events) until they resolved to grade 2. Dose reductions
may be necessary for grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4
thrombocytopenia. The dose reduction schedule man5230

dated a reduction to placebo for the 5 mg group and a
reduction to 15 mg for the 25 mg group.
Statistical Methods
The primary outcome was OS with secondary endpoints
of time to progression, tumor response rate, and safety.
OS and time to progression endpoints were assessed using
the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Cox proportional hazards were used to assess the variable effects on
treatment. Comparisons for response between subgroups
were assessed using the Fisher exact test. Comparisons for
the time to progression and OS curves were assessed using
unstratified log-rank tests. All comparisons were 1-tailed
at the 0.025 level (adjusted for 1 interim analysis).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 294 patients randomized to treatment, 293
patients were included in the data analyses. Figure 1 shows
the patient flow through the study, and patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, baseline patient
characteristics were well balanced. Both study arms had a
higher percentage of males than females (lenalidomide
5 mg [study arm A] 64.2% males vs 59.6% males lenalidomide 25 mg [study arm B]). This was consistent with
the gender distribution of metastatic melanoma. Study
arms were similar for median ECOG performance status

dose was 6.8 months versus 7.2 months for the 5 mg dose.
A lower ECOG performance status score, normal LDH
levels, and a lower metastatic site classification positively
affected OS in both treatment arms (Table 2). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between the 2
doses for the OS in these subgroups of patients (Table 2).

Lenalidomide Dose Evaluation in Melanoma/Glaspy et al

FIGURE 3. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation plot of time to progression is shown.

Time to Progression
Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation plot of time to progression. Median time to progression was 2.2 months for the lenalidomide 25 mg group
and 1.9 months for the 5 mg group. No significant differences in time to progression were observed between the 2
lenalidomide regimens (P ¼ .24) (Table 2). There were
no differences between the 2 doses of lenalidomide for the
time to progression in subgroups of patients stratified by
their ECOG performance status score, LDH level, and
metastatic site classification (ECOG [0 or 1, 2] P ¼ .24;
LDH [normal, elevated] P ¼ .17, metastatic site classification [M1, M2, M3] P ¼ .23).

Adverse Events
Adverse events of all grades are detailed in Table 3. At least
1 adverse event was observed in 98.6% and 97.3%
of patients in the lenalidomide 25 mg and 5 mg treatment groups, respectively. Discontinuation of treatment
due to adverse events was seen in 22.6% and 18.4% of
patients in the 25 mg and 5 mg treatment groups, respectively. Adverse events leading to dose reduction were
not observed in the 25 mg treatment group but were
seen in 1.4% of patients in the 5 mg group. Myelosuppression was observed in 37.0% of patients in the 25 mg
group and 13.6% in the 5 mg treatment group (Table 4).
Cancer

November 15, 2009

At least 1 treatment-related serious adverse event was
observed in 39.0% and 35.4% of patients in the 25 mg
and 5 mg treatment groups, respectively (Table 5 shows
those occurring in 1% of patients per group). Frequently observed treatment-related serious adverse events
were pulmonary embolism (3.4% of patients in the 5 mg
lenalidomide study arm) and neutropenia (2.7% of
patients in the 25 mg lenalidomide study arm). No clear
treatment-related NCI-CTC grade 4 or 5 adverse events
were noted.

Patient Disposition
More than half of the patients in each study arm had discontinued treatment with lenalidomide before the start of
cycle 3; 45.2% of patients in the 25 mg study arm started
cycle 3 compared with 33.8% of those in the 5 mg study
arm. Throughout all cycles, the median dose received by
patients was 25 mg in the 25 mg lenalidomide study arm
and 5 mg in the 5 mg lenalidomide study arm, with only
2 (1.4%) patients in the 5 mg lenalidomide study arm and
none in the 25 mg lenalidomide study arm requiring a
dose reduction.

shown to be effective in increasing OS. This disease is,
therefore, particularly vexing and there is a clear unmet
medical need for an effective treatment. There are interesting preclinical data suggesting that lenalidomide may
have efficacy in this disease, and it is being tested in a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial. However, even if
lenalidomide is shown to be effective in improving outcomes such as time to progression or OS, the optimal
dose will remain an important question. We report the
5234

results of a randomized trial of 2 doses of lenalidomide to
determine their relative efficacy and safety for patients
with metastatic malignant melanoma.
In this study, there were no significant differences
observed in tumor response rates, time to progression, or
OS between the 2 dose levels. A time to progression of
about 2 months and an OS of about 7 months were
observed after lenalidomide treatment, independent of
the dose used.

The 25 mg dose of lenalidomide was associated with
greater myelosuppression compared with the 5 mg dose.
In all, myelosuppression was a common adverse event, as
is the case in patients with hematological malignancies
treated with lenalidomide.23 As the patients in the present

study had limited prior cytotoxic therapy and, thus, presumably normal bone marrow function, the results suggest that the observed myelosuppression is a result of
treatment with lenalidomide.
The current study does not suggest that either dose
of lenalidomide (5 mg or 25 mg) has significant activity in
this disease. Despite the occurrence of treatment-related
serious adverse events, 80% of patients continued treatment The results for both treatment arms were similar to
those of 68 inactive regimens in an ECOG phase 2 study
population trial.24 Perhaps the use of this agent in previously untreated patients, or in combination with other
active agents, might produce more favorable results. Ultimately, the efficacy of lenalidomide as a single agent for
the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma will
be determined in the randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trial which has completed accrual.
