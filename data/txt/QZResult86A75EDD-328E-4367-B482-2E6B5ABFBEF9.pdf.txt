Abstract
Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B), located at 3p21.3, is a secreted
member of the semaphorin family important in axonal
guidance. SEMA3B undergoes allele and expression loss in
lung and breast cancer and can function as a tumor
suppressor. Previously, we found that SEMA3B induces
apoptosis in tumor cells either by reexpression or when
applied as a soluble ligand. SEMA3B-induced apoptosis was
mediated, in part, by blocking vascular endothelial growth
factor autocrine activity in tumor cells. In the current study,
treatment of lung and breast cancer cells with picomolar
concentrations of soluble SEMA3B inhibited their growth;
induced apoptosis; and was associated with decreased Akt
phosphorylation, increase in cytochrome c release and
caspase-3 cleavage, as well as increased phosphorylation of
several proapoptotic proteins, including glycogen synthase
kinase-3B, FKHR, and MDM-2. Lung and breast cancer lines
resistant to SEMA3B did not show these signaling changes and
a tumor-derived missense SEMA3B mutant was inactive in this
regard, providing specificity. SEMA3B-mediated inhibition of
proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells were
blocked by expressing a constitutively active Akt mutant and
are linked to tumor cell expression of neuropilin-1 (Np-1).
SEMA3B-insensitive Np-1–negative tumor cells acquired sensitivity to SEMA3B after forced expression of Np-1, whereas
SEMA3B-sensitive Np-1–positive tumor cells lost sensitivity to
SEMA3B after knockdown of Np-1 by small interfering RNA.
We conclude that SEMA3B is a potential tumor suppressor
that induces apoptosis in SEMA3B-inactivated tumor cells
through the Np-1 receptor by inactivating the Akt signaling
pathway. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8295–303]

Introduction
Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) encodes a secreted protein with
tumor suppressor activity that is located at chromosome region
3p21.3, a site of frequent allele loss in the early pathogenesis of lung
and breast cancers (1–4). SEMA3B belongs to the secreted class 3
semaphorins (SEMA3), which form a complex with neuropilins
(Np-1 and Np-2) and plexins on the cell surface. The literature
reports that neuropilins provide binding sites for SEMA3B
molecules, whereas plexins are responsible for signal transduction

(5, 6). Neuropilins also serve as coreceptors for vascular endothelial
growth factor-A (VEGF-A). In neural cells, neuropilins regulate
axon guidance, whereas in endothelial cells they regulated
angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration (7, 8). Thus, neuropilins
and VEGF-A play an important role in tumorigenesis and, along
with semaphorins, may serve as important therapeutic targets.
Previously, we showed that exogenously added soluble SEMA3B or
forced expression of SEMA3B in breast and non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells induced apoptosis and dramatically decreased their ability to form colonies (1, 3). Independent studies
showed that SEMA3B also inhibited ovarian tumor formation in a
xenograft model (4). Recently, we established that SEMA3B and
VEGF165 play antagonistic roles in regulation of apoptosis and
survival of lung and breast carcinoma cell lines. We found that
externally added VEGF165 rescues cancer cells from SEMA3Binduced apoptosis. These results suggest that tumor suppressor
effects of SEMA3B might be mediated by blocking an autocrine
VEGF-induced signaling, possibly through competition for binding
of Np-1 receptors (1).
Although the proapoptotic and growth-inhibiting activities of
SEMA3B in epithelial cancer cells have been shown in several
laboratories, the signal transduction pathway(s) underlying these
actions has not yet been established. The functional relationship
between VEGF-A and some of the members of SEMA3 has been
shown in cancer and noncancer systems (1, 9, 10). Furthermore,
SEMA3A and SEMA3F are linked with an antagonistic effect in the
presence of VEGF-A that leads to down-regulation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (10). Akt, also
known as protein kinase B, modulates the function of numerous
substrates involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle
progression, and cellular growth (11, 12). Akt is activated
downstream of PI3K in response to receptor stimulation (11). Full
activation of Akt requires phosphorylation at T308 by pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1) and at S473 in the hydrophobic
motif, which can be mediated by several kinases, including PDK1
(13), integrin-linked kinase (ILK; ref. 14), Akt itself (15), DNAdependent protein kinase (16), and mammalian target of
rapamycin (17). Akt-mediated phosphorylation leads to inactivation of apoptotic regulators Bad, procaspase-9, several members of
the forkhead family that induce expression of Fas, and other
proapoptotic factors. Phospho-Akt also activates MDM-2, which
targets p53 for degradation (18–21). Akt activation also promotes
cell cycle progression and cell growth by preventing nuclear
localization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27,
by maintaining levels of the antiapoptotic protein survivin, and by
inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), leading to the
stabilized expression of cyclin D1 (22–24). Akt seems to play a
critical role in the pathogenesis of various human cancers, such as
lung cancer, in which constitutive activation or overexpression of
Akt correlates with poor prognosis and drug resistance (25, 26).

Finally, transgenic mice overexpressing Akt in combination with
other genetic alterations show significantly increased tumor
formation (27).
To better understand both the role and the potential for SEMA3B
as a novel therapeutic for cancer, we studied the signaling
pathways altered by SEMA3B in human lung and breast cancer
cells. Our results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of
SEMA3B is mediated by Np-1–dependent down-regulation of Akt
phosphorylation and kinase activity, leading to expected changes in
signaling molecules downstream of Akt. These data further support
the suppressive role of SEMA3B in tumorigenesis and its potential
as a therapeutic agent by linking the loss of SEMA3B to increased
activation of Akt mediated through the Np-1 receptor important
for both SEMA3B and VEGF-A signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. NSCLC lines A549, NCI-H1299, NCI-H441, NCI-H23, NCIH1792, NCI-H2009, and NCI-H1993 were obtained from the Hamon Center
Repository. Additional cell lines included Cos7 monkey kidney cells, and
breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75-A were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. Lung carcinoma cells and Cos7 were
grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.
MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75-A cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines tested free of
Mycoplasma and were routinely DNA fingerprinted to assure their identity.
Expression plasmids. All Akt expression plasmids were kindly provided
by Dr. James R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada). For transfection of mammalian cells, genes encoding human wildtype SEMA3B , wild-type Akt (pAkt), mutant Akt (pAktMUT), and
constitutive active Akt (pAktDD) were inserted into neo containing pcDNA3
expression vector (Promega). Np-1 inserted into pcDNA3 expression vector
was provided by Dr. Gary Gallick (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX). Genes encoding human wild-type SEMA3B, mutant SEMA3B (SEMA3BMUT) containing a lung cancer–derived single missense mutation D397H
(SEMA3Bmut), and VEGF165 were inserted into pcDNA3 expression vector
(Promega). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine
Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
analyzed 48 h after transfection.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using
the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR Systems (Invitrogen), and amplification
products were resolved on 2% agarose gels. A schedule for typical RT-PCR
consisted of 1 h of reverse transcription at 42jC followed by 35 cycles of
1 min of denaturation at 95jC, 1 min of annealing, and 1 min of extension at
72jC. All samples analyzed by RT-PCR were also tested for h-actin
expression to confirm the integrity of the RNA. Primer sequences for
neuropilins and plexins have been previously described (28).
Antibodies and Western blot analysis. Antibodies used for Akt kinase
assay and Western blot analysis were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology with the exception of the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody that
was purchased from Oncogene Science. Our mouse monoclonal antiSEMA3B antibody has been previously described (1). For Western blot
analysis, cells were lysed in NP40 extraction buffer [40 mmol/L HEPESNaOH (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, proteinase inhibitors]. Total protein (30–50 Ag) was separated on 10%
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Schleicher &
Schuell). Membranes were blocked for 30 min with 5% dry milk in 0.1%
Tween 20 in TBS and incubated with primary antibodies as recommended
by Cell Signaling Technology at 4jC overnight. Primary antibody excess was
removed and membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
labeled secondary antibodies from Amersham Pharmacia for 40 min before
development using SuperSignal Chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). For
detection of cytochrome c on Western blot, we used a BD ApoAlert Cell
Fractionation kit (BD Biosciences).

Cell growth assays and soluble SEMA3B conditioned medium
preparation. Cos7 cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3 (referred
to as vector control) or plasmids encoding wild-type or a missense mutant
SEMA3B and medium was collected 48 h after transfection to produce
control-CM, SEMA3B-CM, or SEMA3Bmut-CM. An average of 15 to
40 ng/mL of SEMA3B was detected in SEMA3B-CM as determined by
semiquantitative ELISA using our monoclonal anti-SEMA3B antibody (1).
Cells were seeded in six-well (35 mm) plates at a density of 10,000
per well in the presence of control-CM or SEMA3B-CM diluted 1:2 with
medium, and cells were enumerated 5 d later. Assays were performed in
triplicate and repeated at least twice. For proliferation assays, cells were
transfected with Akt constructs (pAkt, pAktMUT, and pAktDD) and selected
using G418 before reseeding and treatment with SEMA3B-CM.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, fixed
with 70% ethanol, treated with 5 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma), stained with
50 Ag/mL propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA
content and cell cycle status (FACSCalibur instrument, Becton Dickinson,
equipped with CellQuest software).
Akt kinase assay. Akt kinase assay of cells treated with SEMA3B-CM was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling
Technology). Cells (0.5–1106) were plated, treated with SEMA3B-CM for
2 h, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then placed for 15 min in 500 AL of
ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and allowed to immunoprecipitate overnight at 4jC with anti-Akt
antibody. Immunoprecipitates on beads were washed twice with lysis buffer
and kinase buffer [25 nmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L MgCl2]. The kinase reaction
was performed for 30 min at 30jC in kinase buffer supplemented with
200 Amol/L ATP and 1 Ag of GSK-3a/h fusion protein. The reaction was
terminated with addition of 3 SDS buffer. Samples were heated at 100jC
for 3 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylated
protein bands were visualized as described under Western blot analysis.
Small interfering RNA. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed
against Np-1, control siRNA, and Np-1–detecting antibody was from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. In vitro transfection was performed using Oligofectamine reagent from Invitrogen, and 50% confluent cells in six-well plates
were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then
treated with SEMA3B-CM 72 h after transfection.
Statistical analysis. The results are expressed as mean F SD for at least
three separate (replicate) experiments for each treatment. Statistically
significant differences among groups were assessed by a two-tailed
Student’s t test with values of P < 0.05 sufficient to reject the null
hypothesis for all analyses. All experiments were designed with matched
control conditions within each experiment to enable statistical comparison
as paired samples. All experiments were repeated thrice.

Results
Expression of Np-1, Np-2, plexin A1, plexin A2, Akt, and
SEMA3B in lung and breast cancer cells. In preparation for the
functional studies described below, we first determined the mRNA
expression of receptors for SEMA3B (Np-1, Np-2, plexin A1, and
plexin A2) in seven lung and two breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A).
Plexin A receptors are reportedly used by SEMA3 for activation (29,
30). Plexin A1 was detected in most tumor lines, whereas plexin A2
was detected only in A549, H1993, and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A).
Np-1 was expressed in all the cell lines with the exception of ZR-75
breast cancer cells, whereas Np-2 was expressed only in NSCLC
cells A549, H441, H1792, and H2009 with trace expression detected
in NSCLC H1299 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A,
top). We also determined under standard culture conditions total
Akt and phospho-Akt proteins as well as SEMA3B protein (Fig. 1A,

bottom). Both phospho-Akt (Ser473) and total Akt proteins were
detected in all cells examined albeit at different levels. Np-1–
negative ZR-75-A cells showed the highest levels of phospho-Akt.
SEMA3B protein was detected in only one cell line (NSCLC H2009)
out of the nine lines examined in this study, supporting the
proposed role for SEMA3B as a tumor suppressor. This is
consistent with reports showing loss of SEMA3B expression in
the majority of lung carcinomas.
SEMA3B inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in
lung and breast carcinoma lines. Previously, we have shown that
transfection with plasmid encoding SEMA3B inhibits the growth of
many, but not all, lung and breast cancer cell lines (1, 3). In the
present study, we examined the effect of SEMA3B-CM or controlCM on tumor cell line proliferation. Treatment with SEMA3B-CM
for 4 days decreased proliferation of breast cancer line MDA-MB231 and lung cancer lines A549, H441, H1792, and H1299 by 40% to
70% (Fig. 1B). SEMA3B-CM had no effect on SEMA3B-resistant

lines that included breast carcinoma ZR-75 (3) and NSCLC lines
H23, H2009, and H1993 (Fig. 1B).
Three SEMA3B-sensitive cell lines were chosen to study the
effect of SEMA3B on apoptosis using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 cleavage
assays (Fig. 1C and D; ref. 3). A549, H441, and H1299 cells were
transfected with empty vector or a SEMA3B expression plasmid,
and cell viability was measured 48 h after transfection. At this time,
>90% of the cells transfected with control vector were alive, with
only 0.5% to 9% of cells displaying signs of apoptotic death
(Fig. 1C). By contrast, up to 50% of tumor cells in SEMA3Btransfected cultures were apoptotic (Fig. 1C). Similar induction of
apoptosis was observed after treatment of tumor cells with
SEMA3B-CM and confirmed by measuring release of cytochrome
c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (Fig. 1D). This event is
crucial for formation of the apoptosome and caspase-9 complex as
well as caspase-3 cleavage, which eventually leads to cell death.

Figure 2. SEMA3B reduces Akt phosphorylation and inhibits Akt kinase activity in SEMA3B-sensitive NSCLC cells. Extracts of A549, H441, H1299, and H2009
cells were collected after treatment with control-CM (C ), SEMA3B-CM, or SEMA3Bmut-CM for different times. PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (WM ) and LY294002 (LY)
were used as positive controls for inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. A, inhibition of lung cancer p-Akt levels by treatment with SEMA3B. Cell extracts
from the lung carcinoma cell lines were collected after treatment with control-CM (C ), LY294002, or SEMA3B-CM (SEMA3B ) at the indicated time points after treatment
and evaluated for the levels of p-Akt and total Akt by Western blotting. B, SEMA3B-resistant H2009 lung cancer cells show no change in p-Akt after SEMA3B
treatment but do respond to wortmannin. Western blot analysis for p-Akt in H2009 lung carcinoma cells treated with SEMA3B-CM, control-CM (C ), or wortmannin
at different time points. C, SEMA3B-sensitive H1299 lung cancer cells showed decreased pAkt level in response to wild-type (SEMA3B-CM, top ) but not to
mutant SEMA3B-CM (SEMA3Bmut-CM, bottom ), determined by Western blot analysis. D, SEMA3B inhibition of Akt kinase activity in phosphorylating GSK in lung
cancer cells A549 and H441. Cells were treated with SEMA3B-CM (S ), control-CM (C ), or wortmannin for 6 h. Top, endogenous Akt was immunoprecipitated
after treatment and tested for in vitro ability to phosphorylate GSK-3a/h; bottom, Western blot analysis detecting phospho-GSK-3h (p-GSK-3b ) in the whole-cell
extracts of H441 and A549 before immunoprecipitation by anti-Akt antibody.

Similar release of cytochrome c was detected in cells treated by
staurosporine (Fig. 1D), a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor
frequently used as an inducer of apoptosis. Treatment with
SEMA3B-CM also induced cleavage of caspase-3 in A549 and
H441 NSCLC cells (Fig. 1D), as previously reported for H1299 cells
(1). Cleavage of procaspase-3, a hallmark of induced apoptosis, is
considered a nonreversible event in the apoptotic cascade. Thus,
treatment of three different tumor lines with SEMA3B resulted in
identical proapoptotic outcome, including decreased cell number,
release of cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3. These data are
consistent with our previous studies and collectively implicate
SEMA3B in tumor growth inhibition and as a potent apoptotic
inducer in multiple lung and breast cancer cell lines.
SEMA3B inhibits Akt kinase activity in NSCLC. Because Akt
kinase activity can inhibit apoptosis and Akt is expressed prominently in most lung and breast cancer cells, we examined the effect
of SEMA3B-CM on the phosphorylation status of Akt in these cells.
Treatment with SEMA3B significantly (>95%) reduced phosphoAkt in A549, H441, and H1299 lung carcinoma cells (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Table S1 for quantification). The reduction in
phospho-Akt was observed 30 min after exposure to SEMA3B-CM,
persisted for at least 6 h, and returned to near baseline levels
24 h after treatment. Two PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (500 nmol/L)
and LY294002 (50 Amol/L), were used as controls to show functionality and responsiveness of the Akt pathway to inhibitors in the
cancer cells at the time of the treatment. Both SEMA3B-sensitive and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

SEMA3B-resistant tumor cells responded to wortmannin and
LY294002 inhibitors by down-regulating phospho-Akt. However,
only tumor lines sensitive to SEMA3B growth inhibition, but not the
resistant line H2009, down-regulated phospho-Akt in response to
SEMA3B treatment (Fig. 2A and B). These findings provide
specificity of the SEMA3B effects and support the notion that
antiproliferative effect of SEMA3B in tumor cells sensitive to its
action is mediated, in part, by suppressing Akt activity. This
conclusion is also supported by the failure of a soluble SEMA3B
missense mutant (SEMA3Bmut-CM) to decrease phosphorylation of
Akt at Ser473 (Fig. 2C). SEMA3Bmut-CM was previously shown to be
inactive in cell proliferation and colony formation assays (3) and
thus adds to the case for correlating the antiproliferative effects of
SEMA3B with attenuation of the Akt pathway.
To further show the functional significance of the effect of
SEMA3B on Akt, we measured Akt kinase activity extracted from
control-treated and SEMA3B-CM–treated cells. This was done by
precipitating Akt from cell lysates using an anti–Akt-specific
antibody and analyzing the capacity of precipitates to phosphorylate a known Akt substrate, GSK-3h, in vitro. The relative kinase
activities of Akt immunoprecipitates were compared with those
in cells treated by wortmannin (Fig. 2D). In A549 and H441 cell
lines, SEMA3B-CM and wortmannin inhibited Akt kinase activity to
similar levels and both also decreased phosphorylation of endogenous GSK-3h as determined by the Akt kinase assay in whole-cell
extracts (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that SEMA3B

can decrease Akt kinase activity in cells that are sensitive to
SEMA3B.
SEMA3B inhibits signaling molecules both upstream and
downstream of Akt. Akt kinase is a critical regulator of the
PI3K pathway, which promotes cell survival (18). Therefore, the
specificity of the inhibitory effect of SEMA3B on Akt kinase was
assessed in comparison with other mediators involved in the PI3K/
Akt pathway. Western blotting was used to analyze several
upstream and downstream proteins in this pathway in controltreated and SEMA3B-treated A549, H441, and H1299 lung cancer
cells (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S1 for quantification). The list of
analyzed proteins included the activated p85, the regulatory
subunit of the PI3K complex, PDK1, and PTEN that are functionally
located upstream of Akt and involved directly in its activation.
We also analyzed several downstream proteins, including FKHR,
GSK-3, and MDM-2, whose phosphorylation is increased in
response to Akt activation.
Treatment of A549 and H441 cells with SEMA3B-CM decreased
the phosphorylation of Tyr458 in p85 and subsequently Ser241 in
PDK1 up to 65% (Fig. 3A and B). In H1299 cells, a 60% decrease
in phosphorylation of PTEN was also observed (Fig. 3C). Dephosphorylated PTEN can counteract Akt activation by reducing
phosphorylation in PIP3, a direct product of PI3K activation
(31). Thus, multiple downstream Akt substrates showed decreased
phosphorylation after SEMA3B treatment in several tumor lines
(Fig. 3). For example, phosphorylation of S256 in FKHR, S9 in
GSK-3h, and S166 in MDM-2 showed up to an 85% decrease after

SEMA3B-CM treatment in A549, H441, and H1299 cell lines.
Collectively, these data show the inhibitory effect of SEMA3B-CM
on multiple upstream and downstream proteins in the PI3K/Akt
pathway in several SEMA3B-sensitive tumor lines.
Constitutively activated Akt negates SEMA3B effect on cell
proliferation and apoptosis. To further examine the effect of
SEMA3B on the Akt pathway, we transfected and selected A549,
H441, and H1299 lung carcinoma cells with Akt expression vectors,
pAkt, pAktMUT, and pAktDD. The pAkt vector encodes wild-type
cDNA, whereas pAktMUT contains the K179A, T308A, and S473A
mutations, which render Akt unable to bind ATP or be activated.
The pAktDD vector encodes a constitutively active Akt due to
T308D and S473D mutations, thereby rendering it permanently
‘‘activated’’ and no longer under phosphorylation control. A549,
H441, and H1299 lung carcinoma cells stably expressing the Akt
vectors were treated with SEMA3B-CM for 4 days and cell number
was determined. Tumor lines stably transfected with wild-type
Akt, inactive Akt, or an empty vector control had 50% to 70%
reduction in cell number after SEMA3B-CM treatment compared
with control-CM or untreated cells (Table 1). Lines transfected
with wild-type pAkt and inactive pAktMUT showed an increase
in caspase-3 cleavage after 48 h of treatment with SEMA3B-CM
compared with control-CM. By contrast, SEMA3B-CM did not
significantly decrease cell proliferation in tumor cells stably expressing constitutively active pAktDD. In fact, in some cases, pAktDD
combined with SEMA3B increased proliferation (Table 1). Ectopic
expression of Akt vectors in H1299 clearly showed a f5-fold

overexpression of Akt when compared with endogenous Akt
(Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with reduced caspase-3
cleavage after SEMA3B-CM treatment in pAktDD-transfected
tumor cells as observed on Western blots (Fig. 4B). Notably, H441
NSCLC cells expressing the inactive pAktMUT vector showed
higher basal levels of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 4B). These findings
show that constitutively active pAktDD in tumor cells overcomes
the proapoptotic effect of SEMA3B.
Np-1 is required for SEMA3B to inhibit Akt activity in cancer
cells. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express Np-1 and are
sensitive to SEMA3B. ZR-75 cells do not express Np-1 and are
resistant to SEMA3B treatment. The properties of these two lines
provide an opportunity to compare the effect of SEMA3B on Akt
activity in representative SEMA3B-sensitive and SEMA3B-resistant
breast carcinoma lines. Both lines were sensitive to wortmannin
treatments; however, treatment with SEMA3B significantly reduced
phospho-Akt in the Np-1–positive MDA-MB-231 but not in the
Np-1–negative ZR-75 cells. This effect was observed 1 to 24 h
after exposure to SEMA3B-CM (Fig. 5A). SEMA3B treatment also
reduced activation of PDK1 and GSK-3h in MDA-MB-231 cells,
similarly to the effect observed in NSCLC lines (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
when ZR-75 cells were engineered to stably express Np-1, these
cells acquired responsiveness to SEMA3B shown, in part, by downregulation of phospho-Akt in the presence of SEMA3B (Fig. 5C).
To gain better understanding for the requirement for Np-1 to
mediate the effects of SEMA3B, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with Np-1–specific siRNA or siRNA of irrelevant target specificity.
As shown in Fig. 5D (top left), Np-1 protein was reduced by 40%

absence of SEMA3B treatment (Fig. 5D, bottom). MDA-MB-231 cells
with decreased Np-1 expression also lost the ability to downregulate phospho-Akt in response to SEMA3B, whereas this effect

right). Together, these studies indicate that treatment with soluble
SEMA3B inhibits both the phosphorylation and the activity of
Akt in SEMA3B-sensitive lung and breast cancer cells in a Np-1–
dependent manner.

Discussion
SEMA3B is a candidate tumor suppressor because it frequently
undergoes allele loss and reduced expression or function in lung
and breast cancers (usually through epigenetic mechanisms),
whereas reexpression decreases cell proliferation and induces
apoptosis in lung, breast, and ovarian cancer cells (3, 4). Recently,
our laboratory showed that SEMA3B exerts its tumor suppressor

www.aacrjournals.org

effects through competition with VEGF165 (1). This presumably
occurs because SEMA3B and VEGF165 compete for neuropilin
receptors on the tumor cell surface (1). VEGF-A has been shown to
promote tumor cell proliferation and survival in an autocrine
manner through binding Np-1. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is
that SEMA3B mediates its tumor-suppressing effects, in part, by
blocking VEGF-A autocrine activity in tumor cells. VEGF-A
signaling includes activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (32). The
link between the PI3K/Akt pathway and semaphorin-induced
signaling in tumor cells has been previously suggested by the
studies with SEMA3F, another member of the semaphorin family.
SEMA3F, a protein with similar tumor suppressor properties as
those of SEMA3B, is located in the 3p21.3 region that is f75 kb

away from SEMA3B (33, 34). SEMA3F has been shown to antagonize neurotrophin-induced PI3K and mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase signaling in sympathetic neurons leading to growth
cone collapse (9). Reintroduction of SEMA3F in H157 NSCLC
cells suppressed tumor cell density and growth as well as ILKextracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt/signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 signaling (35). In the present
report, we tested the hypothesis that SEMA3B, a member of the
same semaphorin family, exerts similar tumor-inhibitory effects by
binding Np-1 receptor that induces signals suppressing the PI3K/
Akt pathway activation. The results of the studies reported here
showed that exogenously added SEMA3B inhibits the PI3K/Akt
pathway acting through Np-1 receptors in cancer cells, leading
to decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis. Our studies
showed that SEMA3B decreased phosphorylation of Akt and
multiple other proteins related to the Akt pathway, including p85
(PI3K complex), PDK, PTEN, GSK-3h, FKHR, and MDM-2. These
Akt pathway effects were observed in NSCLC and breast cancer
cells that are sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of SEMA3B.
By contrast, SEMA3B-driven changes in Akt phosphorylation or
related pathway changes did not occur in SEMA3B-resistant tumor
cells or in cells treated with a SEMA3B missense mutant protein,
indicating the specificity of the effect of SEMA3B. The reduced
level of Akt phosphorylation in sensitive cells after SEMA3B-CM
treatment is associated with diminished Akt capacity to phosphorylate GSK-3a/h substrate. We confirmed these observations by
the introduction of pAktDD, which overcame the SEMA3B effects
on NSCLC cells. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Np-1 in ZR75 cells (Np-1 negative) and knockdown of Np-1 in MDA-MB-231
cells (Np-1 positive) show that in these cells Np-1 mediates
SEMA3B effects on the Akt pathway. However, the fact that
SEMA3B-resistant lines H2009, H23, and H1993 express Np-1
suggests that Np-1 is necessary but not sufficient for SEMA3B to
exert its effect on cell survival, inhibition of Akt kinase activity, and
subsequently reduction of phosphorylation of survival-promoting
proteins. The mechanism of SEMA3B resistance will be of great
interest to unravel but, as described in Results, these ‘‘SEMA3Bresistant’’ tumor lines provide important specificity controls for
all of our experiments. Thus, despite these exceptions between
Np-1 expression and response to SEMA3B, in a major subset of
NSCLC and breast cancer cells, the addition of SEMA3B, at
picomolar concentrations, functions through Np-1 to inactivate Akt
signaling activity, consequently decreasing proliferation and
inducing apoptosis.
Np-1 is expressed at a high level in tumors of epithelial origin
(carcinomas), whereas tumors from different origin such as melanomas strongly express Np-2 (36–38). Increased expression of Np-1
and Np-2 correlates with tumor aggressiveness, advanced disease
stage, and poor prognosis (39–41). In contrast, several studies have
reported that Np-1 overexpression in tumor cells reduces motility
and tumorigenicity or prolonged patient survival (42–45). Possible
reasons for discrepancies between various studies may include the
expression of functional receptor/ligand repertoire (e.g., plexins)

and/or the ratio of VEGF-A to SEMA3 within the particular tumor
microenvironment. Np-1 internalizes on ligand binding at different
rates depending on a ligand type (46). Preferential receptor binding
and ligand-mediated internalization suggest a mechanism by
which a common receptor, Np-1, can function in prioritizing
conflicting signals (46). These effects of neuropilins suggest their
potential as targets for antitumor therapy.
The Akt pathway is activated in a variety of carcinomas of lung,
breast, colon, and pancreatic and other tumor types through
overexpression of Akt protein. Additionally, KRAS, EGFR , and
PI3K mutations activate this pathway as well as loss of negative
regulatory proteins such as PTEN that shuts down the PI3K
pathway (47). In the clinical setting, aberrations in the Akt pathway
are associated with poor prognosis and a decreased patient
survival rate after combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (25).
Recent reports have shown that radiation activates the Akt
pathway, which may promote endothelial cell survival (48).
Moreover, radiation-induced Akt activation also increased cell
migration and subsequently metastasis in animal models of breast
cancer and in cultured pancreatic carcinoma cells (49, 50). These
studies collectively show the effect that the Akt pathway exerts on
tumorigenesis, tumor angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis as well as tumor responses to anticancer therapies. Drugs
that negatively regulate the Akt pathway in either tumor cells or
angiogenic endothelial cells could be of therapeutic value. In our
experimental model, exogenously added SEMA3B induces apoptosis, in part, by inhibiting the Akt pathway in lung and breast cancer
cells. SEMA3B effect on phosphorylation starts with the upstream
protein, PI3K, and continues down the Akt pathway also affecting
downstream proteins, such as GSK-3h, FKHR, and MDM-2. The
inhibitory effect of SEMA3B on the Akt pathway in tumor cells with
numerous genetic and epigenetic changes and the role of Np-1 in
this effect suggest SEMA3B as a potential novel systemic
anticancer therapeutic agent. Moreover, given the important role
of Akt in cell survival, SEMA3B down-regulation of Akt activity
might also sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
other types of therapy. Based on the data reported here, further
assessment of antitumor and antimetastatic effects of soluble
SEMA3B is warranted.
