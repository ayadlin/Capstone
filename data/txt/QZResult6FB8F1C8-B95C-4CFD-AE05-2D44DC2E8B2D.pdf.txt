Abstract

Author Manuscript

The canonical role of messenger RNA (mRNA) is to deliver protein-coding information to sites of
protein synthesis. However, given that microRNAs bind to RNAs, we hypothesized that RNAs
possess a biological role in cancer cells that relies upon their ability to compete for microRNA
binding and is independent of their protein-coding function. As a paradigm for the protein-codingindependent role of RNAs, we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced
by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene (PTENP1) and the critical consequences
of this interaction. We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as determined by its ability to
regulate cellular levels of PTEN, and that it can exert a growth-suppressive role. We also show
that PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer. We extend our analysis to other cancerrelated genes that possess pseudogenes, such as oncogenic KRAS. Further, we demonstrate that
the transcripts of protein coding genes such as PTEN are also biologically active. Together, these
findings attribute a novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate coding
gene expression, and reveal a non-coding function for mRNAs.

In human cancers, monoallelic mutation of PTEN without loss or mutation of the second
allele is prevalent at presentation, while complete loss is observed at low frequencies with
the exception of advanced cancers1. In mouse models, heterozygosity for Pten leads to
multiple cancers2, and serial reduction of Pten dosage has critical consequences for the
incidence and severity of epithelial cancers3,4, together suggesting that PTEN is a
functionally haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene. The identification and validation of

numerous PTEN-targeting microRNAs demonstrates that post-transcriptional regulation
plays a pivotal role in determining PTEN abundance in cancer cells5–11. Cells are
ultrasensitive to even subtle decreases in PTEN abundance, thus highlighting the importance
of microRNA-mediated PTEN regulation in cancer4. Therefore, we reasoned that the
relationship between PTEN and its pseudogene PTENP1 (PTH2/ψPTEN)12 could represent
a compelling test for our hypothesis (Fig. 1a).
Pseudogenes are defined as genomic loci that resemble real genes, yet are considered
biologically inconsequential because they harbour premature stop codons, deletions/
insertions and frameshift mutations that abrogate their translation into functional proteins.
Nevertheless, nucleotide sequences contained within pseudogenes are well preserved,
suggesting that selective pressure to maintain these genetic elements exists, and that they
may indeed play an important cellular role.

Author Manuscript

Pseudogenes exist as either processed or non-processed genetic elements. While nonprocessed pseudogenes arose from genetic duplications, processed pseudogenes were
generated through retrotransposition; thus they contain no introns yet they commonly share
5’ and 3’ UTR sequences with their ancestral genes13. Pseudogenes are almost as numerous
as coding genes and represent a significant proportion of the “transcriptome”14. Despite
lacking canonical promoters, processed pseudogenes utilize proximal regulatory elements to
mediate their transcription15. Their transcription exhibits tissue-specificity16 and is
aberrantly activated in cancer17,18, suggesting that pseudogenes may contribute to
carcinogenesis, although the mechanisms still remain elusive. Very few pseudogenes have
been functionally characterized thus far13.

MicroRNAs, a large class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), have emerged as a critical
element in cellular biology and pathophysiology. microRNAs have been demonstrated to
impact almost all cellular processes and cell types from plants to humans19. microRNAs
function by annealing to complementary sites on coding sequences or 3’UTRs of target gene
transcripts, where they promote the recruitment of protein complexes that impair translation
and/or decrease the stability of mRNA leading to a decrease in target protein
abundance19–22. Physiologically, aberrant expression of microRNAs has been causally
linked to human diseases and cancer23.
We have tested whether pseudogene-derived RNA transcripts and mRNA transcripts possess
an active biological role in cancer that is independent of their protein-coding function but
would rely upon their ability to compete for microRNA binding, thereby modulating the
derepression of microRNA targets (Fig. 1a).

PTENP1 is targeted by PTEN-targeting microRNAs
PTENP1 is a processed pseudogene residing at 9p13.3; it is highly homologous to PTEN,
with only 18 mismatches throughout the coding sequence. A missense mutation of the
initiator methionine codon prevents translation12. PTENP1 possesses a 3’-UTR that is ~1kb
shorter than that of PTEN (Fig. 1b). It can be divided into 2 regions relative to its homology
with the PTEN 3’UTR: a high homology (~95%) 5’ region and a low homology (<50%) 3’
region (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). Within the high homology region, we found

perfectly conserved seed matches for the PTEN-targeting miR-17, miR-21, miR-214, miR-19
and miR-26 families (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). To measure the role of these
microRNAs on both PTEN and PTENP1 expression, we designed specific PCR primer sets
in the non-homologous 3’UTR regions (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). In DU145 prostate cancer
cells, PTEN-targeting microRNAs miR-19b and miR-20a suppress both PTEN and PTENP1
mRNA abundance (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3a). In these cells, a pool of inhibitors of
endogenously expressed PTEN-targeting microRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 3b) de-repressed
both PTEN and PTENP1 transcript levels (Fig. 1e). The use of chimeric luciferase plasmids
indicated the microRNA:PTENP1 interaction was direct (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). These
data indicate that PTENP1 and PTEN are subjected to the same microRNA-mediated, posttranscriptional regulation.

The 3’UTR of PTENP1 has tumour suppressive activity
Author Manuscript

We examined the ability of PTENP1 3’UTR to function as a decoy of PTEN-targeting
microRNAs using a retroviral vector expressing this 3’UTR (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The
3’UTR can be transcribed, but it cannot code for protein; however it still may exert a
biological role. Indeed, PTENP1 3’UTR overexpression resulted in a derepression of both
PTEN transcript and protein (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 5b and 10c). Consistent with
elevated PTEN, AKT phosphorylation was reduced upon stimulation of cells with EGF (Fig.
2b). These molecular observations were accompanied by growth inhibition (Fig. 2c,
Supplementary Fig. 5c and 10d) and a significant reduction in the number of colonies
generated in semisolid medium (Fig. 2d).

Author Manuscript

The derepression of PTEN abundance by PTENP1 3’UTR overexpression was blunted in
HCT116-DICER−/− colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 2e). In these cells, the disruption of DICER
-- the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of microRNA maturation -- leads to reduced levels
of mature microRNAs compared to parental HCT116 cells24. This in turn supports the
notion that the 3’UTR of PTENP1 requires mature microRNAs for its function towards
PTEN.

Author Manuscript

To examine the phenotypic consequences of PTENP1 downregulation, we designed custom
siRNA pools (Dharmacon) to specifically target either PTENP1 (si-PTENP1) or PTEN (siPTEN) expression (Supplementary Fig. 6) since commercially available si-RNA pools for
PTEN (si-PTEN/PTENP1) bind to common sequences in PTEN and PTENP1
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). si-PTENP1 transfection accelerated cell proliferation, suggesting
that PTENP1, although expressed at lower relative levels, can exert a biological activity in
DU145 cells (Fig. 2f). si-PTEN/PTENP1, which silences both PTEN and PTENP1, showed
the strongest effect, indicating that PTEN and its pseudogene may have additive roles for
growth suppression. PTENP1 knockdown resulted in decreased PTEN mRNA and protein
abundance (Fig. 2g–h), mirroring the results obtained with overexpression of PTENP1
3’UTR (Fig. 2a).
In DU145 cells PTENP1 3’UTR is a more potent growth suppressor compared to PTEN
(Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5c). This result may be explained by the fact that microRNAs
for which PTENP1 functions as a decoy also bind other targets with tumour suppressive

activities. For instance, the miR-17 family targets E2F1 and p2125, and miR-21 targets
PDCD426. Accordingly, miR-17 and miR-21 mimics increase proliferation of PTEN-null
PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a), suggesting PTEN independency. Indeed, si-PTENP1
resulted in a dose-dependent downregulation not only of PTEN, but also of p21
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). Additionally, both si-PTENP1 and si-PTEN/PTENP1 were able to
suppress PTENP1 and increase proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in PTEN-null PC3
cells (Supplementary Fig. 8c–d). Conversely, stable infection of PTENP1 3’UTR in PC3
cells suppressed foci formation (Supplementary Fig. 8e), supporting the notion that PTENP1
and its 3’UTR exert a tumour suppressive role that goes beyond the regulation of PTEN
abundance alone.

Expression and losses of PTENP1 in human cancer
Author Manuscript

PTEN and PTENP1 expression was explored in normal human tissues and prostate tumour
samples, utilizing custom Taqman probes (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2c). In both the
normal tissue and prostate tumour arrays, the direct correlation (r = 0.8087, p < 0.0001 and r
= 0.3960, p = 0.0013, respectively) between PTEN and PTENP1 expression suggests that
they may be co-regulated (Fig. 3a–b). This finding supports our molecular observations that
PTENP1 can regulate PTEN expression. PTENP1 was found to be variably abundant, and in
some cases expressed at higher levels than PTEN.

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined alterations of the PTENP1 genomic locus. Several array-based
comparative genomic hybridization databases were mined including The Cancer Workbench
(https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/cgi-bin/heatmap) and NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/). (Supplementary Fig. 9a–b, Table S1). Remarkably, in a dataset of sporadic colon
cancer (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16125) (Fig. 3c–
e), hierarchical clustering identified a clear population of samples with detectable copy
number (CN) losses occurring specifically at the PTENP1 locus (Fig. 3c). Importantly, these
CN losses were focal, not associated with large losses of 9p, and independent of losses at the
CDKN2A locus (Supplementary Fig. 9c). T his data set formally demonstrates the existence
of independent genomic CN losses at the PTENP1 locus, supporting the notion that PTENP1
exerts tumour suppressive functions and is under selective pressure to undergo CN losses in
cancer.

Author Manuscript

In the same patient samples set, cluster analysis of PTEN expression showed that it was
down-regulated compared to normal colon samples (p = 0.0008156; Fig. 3d). Regression
analysis of PTENP1 CN variation with the expression levels of PTEN identified two discrete
populations of patients in which PTENP1 CN variation and PTEN expression were directly
and significantly correlated (Population 1: r = 0.6015, p = 0.0092; Population 2: r = 0.6056,
p = 0.0129) (Fig. 3e). The existence of a direct relationship between PTENP1 CN and PTEN
expression supports our hypothesis that PTENP1 transcript levels can regulate PTEN
expression. Together, these findings constitute a proof of principle for the oncosuppressive
activity of PTENP1.

A general model for endogenous mRNA-mediated biology
Based on our results, we expected that the PTEN 3’UTR would also have biological activity.
Indeed, we found that PTEN 3’UTR can derepress PTENP1 abundance, as PTENP1 does on
PTEN (Fig. 4a, left and Supplementary Fig. 10a-c). Importantly, PTEN 3’UTR
overexpression was accompanied by growth inhibition, suggesting that PTEN exerts its
tumour suppressive activity, at least in part, through its 3’UTR (Fig. 4a, right and
Supplementary Fig. 10d).

Author Manuscript

To extend our studies beyond PTEN and its pseudogene, we examined other cancer-related
pseudogenes and genes (Table S2 and S3, Supplementary Fig. 11–17). Alignments of gene
and pseudogenes sequences show that microRNA-binding sites are well conserved; for
example, the miR-145 binding site on OCT4 and its pseudogenes OCT4-pg1, 3, 4 and 5
(Supplementary Fig. 11a); miR-1 family binding sites on CONNEXIN 43 (CX43) and its
pseudogene (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Notably, OCT4-pg1 and -pg5 are exclusively
expressed in cancer tissues and not in normal tissues17. Furthermore OCT4-pg5 is truncated
at the 5’ end and expresses only a partial open reading frame region followed by the
3’UTR27. Further examples of such conservation include: miR-34 family binding site on
CDK4PS (Supplementary Fig. 12); miR-182 binding site on FOXO3B (Supplementary Fig.
13); miR-17 family binding site on E2F3P1 (Supplementary Fig. 14); miR-143 and let-7
family binding sites on KRAS1P (Supplementary Fig. 15).

Author Manuscript

Since the 3’UTR of PTENP1 was growth suppressive like its parental gene PTEN, we
hypothesized a similar relationship between KRAS and its pseudogene KRAS1P. Indeed,
KRAS1P 3’UTR overexpression in DU145 cells resulted in increased KRAS mRNA
abundance (Fig. 4b, left and Supplementary Fig. 18a,b) and accelerated cell growth (Fig. 4b,
right). We also found that the KRAS and KRAS1P transcript levels are positively correlated
in prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. 18c). Notably, the KRAS1P locus at 6p11–12, is
amplified in different human tumours, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma28–30. Together these findings point to a putative proto-oncogenic
role for KRAS1P, and support the notion that pseudogene functions mirror the functions of
their cognate genes as explained by a microRNA decoy mechanism.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The findings presented in this study have allowed us to reach a number of important
conclusions. First, the discovery of a microRNA-decoy function for pseudogenes identifies
these transcripts as biologically active units. We show that PTENP1 and KRAS1P affect the
levels of their cognate genes and are possibly involved in disease pathogenesis. Thus, the
analysis of pseudogene expression level and genomic status in tumourigenesis needs to be
undertaken systematically to further our understanding of disease progression.
Processed pseudogenes in mouse oocytes have been previously reported to generate
endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) that downregulate the expression of
cognate genes through conventional RNA interference31. However, endo-siRNA production
has yet to be identified in somatic human cells32. Notably, while only few pseudogenes

undergo antisense transcription, all transcribed pseudogenes can in principle compete with
cognate genes for microRNA binding. Similarly, the microRNA-decoy capacity of
pseudogenes is likely to be more widespread than their cleavage into piRNAs, which have
been recently discovered only in germ cells of many organisms, including mouse33.

Author Manuscript

We also demonstrate that pseudogenes such as PTENP1 can derepress their cognate genes,
even when expressed at lower levels (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Fig. 2f–h). We propose
that pseudogenes are “perfect decoys” for their ancestral genes, because they retain many of
the microRNA binding sites and can compete for the binding of many microRNAs at once.
It has been hypothesized that suboptimal “pseudotargets” may compete with authentic
targets for microRNA binding34. By contrast, we propose that pseudogenes have an intrinsic
biological activity in microRNA networks because they are legitimate microRNA targets
and compete with other legitimate targets for microRNA binding (Fig. 2e). This notion is
corroborated by the “target mimicry” process that in plants is achieved by the expression of
non-protein coding genes that sequester microRNAs35.
Exogenously administered microRNA sponges have recently emerged as effective and
specific inhibitors of microRNAs36,37. Pseudogenes act like “endogenous sponges”, able to
affect the distribution of microRNA molecules on all their targets. They may be particularly
effective precisely because they are non-coding, thus active translation does not interfere
with microRNA binding38.

Author Manuscript

The ability of pseudogenes to regulate the biology of a cell goes beyond their ability to
modulate the levels of their cognate gene (Supplementary Fig. 8). This phenomenon is
consistent with the fact that each microRNA has multiple targets and can lead to widespread
homeostatic effects. Also, given that a single gene often has numerous differentially
regulated pseudogenes (e.g. OCT4, NPM1 (Supplementary Figs. 11a, 17) and ribosomal
protein pseudogenes39), such networks can become intricately dynamic.
Cellular microRNA abundance is dictated by total genomic CN and by their biogenesis
process40. Less is known about the regulation of mature microRNA activity. microRNAs
can increase their spectrum of targetable mRNAs by undergoing deamination41, while
shortening of 3’UTRs42 and polymorphisms can prevent microRNA binding to mRNAs43.
Pseudogene-mediated microRNA decoys offer a new dimension regulating the cross-talk
between microRNAs and their targets. Indeed the greater the number of pseudogenes that a
protein-coding gene has, the more it is protected from microRNAs.

Author Manuscript

Our discovery of a functional role for PTENP1 is relevant to PTEN biology since minute
changes in PTEN can have tumourigenic consequences3. In our analysis we found that
PTENP1 positively regulates PTEN levels. Furthermore, we found that the PTENP1 locus
undergoes CN losses in human cancer and this correlates with decrease in PTEN; thus we
propose that PTENP1 is a bona fide tumour suppressor gene. In light of this, better tools
must be developed to detect pseudogene abundance in cancer. For instance, pseudogenes
including PTENP1 have been overlooked to such an extent that pseudogene-specific probes
are absent in some microarray platforms (Supplementary Figure 7b).

An important implication of our findings is that the decoy mechanism may not be limited to
pseudogenes, but may include other long ncRNA transcripts including ribosomal RNAs,
lincRNAs and coding gene mRNAs39,44 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 10). Beyond their
function as cis regulatory elements that impact the stability of their own transcripts, UTRs
are also trans modulators of gene expression through microRNA binding. Furthermore,
since binding sites for microRNAs are also located in open reading frame sequences21, the
entire transcript of coding genes, and not only the 3’UTR may possess decoy function (see
working model: Fig. 4c).

Author Manuscript

As our model suggests, mRNA introduced into a cell can potentially perturb the interaction
between microRNAs and their multiple targets and thus, have a biological activity
independent of the translation of the protein they encode45. Importantly, the same applies to
the transcriptional induction or repression of endogenous mRNA levels, which can lead to
changes in the number of mRNA molecules present within a cell in the scale of several
orders of magnitude46.

Author Manuscript

Our findings indicate that, when studying specific nonsense or frameshift mutations and
genomic alterations leading to “readthrough” or fusion transcripts, one must consider this
new RNA-regulated biological dimension. For example, chromosomal fusion events such as
the t(15;17) translocation of APL which generates PML-RARα and RARα-PML fusion
transcripts or recurrent “readthrough” transcripts in melanoma such as CDK2-RAB5B could
exert oncogenic activities through an aberrant microRNA “sponging” activity47,48. This
phenomenon could also occur as a consequence of somatic genomic rearrangements, which
are emerging as grossly unappreciated events in many cancers49. Moreover, the shortening
of 3’UTRs as observed in human cancer cells42 would not solely affect microRNAdependent mRNA regulation, but on the flipside, also alter the “sponging” capacity of a
given RNA transcript. Finally, in the case of PTEN-loss associated cancers, there is little
known of the molecular consequences of PTEN mutations where the PTEN transcript is
retained, compared to complete genetic loss of PTEN where no transcript remains1. While
these events were previously thought to alter protein abundance, protein signaling and
protein networks, they will also have a significant impact on cellular RNA and microRNA
homeostasis. In this study, we have therefore identified a novel dimension by which cellular
and tumour biology can be regulated.

Author Manuscript

The 3’UTR of PTENP1 (NM_023917) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of
PC3 cells and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pCMV-MCS expression plasmid. In
this way, pCMV/ψ3’UTR plasmid was obtained. The primers used for PCR amplification
were: F 5’-GAGGAGCCGTCAAATCCAGAG-3’ and R 5’TCGTCAATGTGTGAGGTTCC-3’. The 3’UTR of PTENP1 was then subcloned into the
BglII and XhoI sites of MSCV-PIG retroviral vector50 to obtain PIG/ψ3’UTR plasmid. The
3’UTR of PTEN (NM_000314.4) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of HeLa
cells and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pCMV-MCS expression plasmid. In this
way, pCMV/PTEN3’UTR plasmid was obtained. The primers used for PCR amplification
were: F 5 ’-TAGAGGAGCCGTCAAATCCA-3 ’ and R 5’TGGACATCTGATTGGGATGA-3’. The 3’UTR of KRAS1P (NC_000006.11) was
amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of HeLa cells and cloned into the BamHI and
XhoI sites of pCMV-MCS expression plasmid. In this way, pCMV/K1P3’UTR plasmid was
obtained. The primers used for PCR amplification were : F 5 ’AACCAGCAAAGACAGGGTGT-3’ and R 5’-GTTCAATTGCTCAACGCAGA-3’. The
homology between wt KRAS and its pseudogene is very high (> 90%) across the whole
mRNA sequence. The primers used for the amplification of KRAS1P 3’UTR contain many
mismatches which made them specific for the pseudogene. In order to construct pGLU/
ψ3’UTR chimeric luciferase plasmid, the multicloning site of pGL3-Control plasmid was
removed from its original position and inserted into the XbaI site located downstream of
Luciferase STOP codon (pGLU). PTENP1 3’UTR was then subcloned from pCMV/
ψ3’UTR plasmids using the SmaI and XhoI sites of pGLU. The QuikChange II XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit was used to generate the mutated version of this plasmid (pGLU/
ψ3’UTRmut).

The real time PCR of mature microRNAs was performed according to Ref. 53 with some
modifications. Briefly, an independent retrotranscription reaction was set up for each
microRNA using 0.05µM of the microRNA-specific RT primer and 0.05µM of SNORD44
RT primer (5’GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACagtcag-3 ’). Realtime PCR of both the microRNA and SNORD44, which was used as an internal standard,
were then carried out using Sybr Green fluorescence (2 µl of RT in a 20 µl reaction). For the
microRNA, a specific forward primer and the universal R primer (5’GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-3’) were used. For SNORD44, 5’CGGCGGtggcgatgaggaggtacc-3’ forward primer and the universal reverse primer were
used. The microRNA-specific RT and forward PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Fig.
19. The Real-time PCR reaction comprised 40 cycles of 95°C for 15sec followed by 60°C
for 1min. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed with the comparative CT
method as described above.
TaqMan RT PCR was performed at the HMS Biopolymers Facility utilizing an Applied
Biosystems 7900 HT Fast instrument.

Cells were collected and lysed (50mM Tris pH8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1mM MgCl2, 150mM
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, protease
inhibitors). Proteins (30 µg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting of the membranes was performed
using the following primary antibodies: anti-PTEN (1:1000), anti-p21 (1:1000), anti-HSP90
(1:1000), anti-Tubulin (1:2000). Signals were revealed after incubation with recommended
secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase by using enhanced chemiluminescence. Scanned
images were quantified using ImageJ software.
FACS analysis

Author Manuscript

After 10 min treatment with 50 ng/ml EGF, cells were scraped from 10 cm dishes,
immediately fixed in 4%PFA and permeabilized with ice cold Methanol. After rehydrating
with 0.1%BSA in PBS, cells were stained with Phospho-Akt (Thr308) Rabbit mAb -Alexa
Fluor® 647 Conjugate (Cell Signaling). Cells were analyzed on an LSRII flow cytometer
(BD).
Cell proliferation
At the end of the selection period (infection) or 6h post-transfection, 2 × 105 DU145 cells
were trypsinized, resuspended in 50ml and seeded in 8 sets of 3 wells of a 12-well plate.

Starting from the following day (d0), 1 set of wells per day was washed once with PBS,
fixed in 10% formalin solution for 10min at room temperature and then kept in PBS at 4°C.
At day 7, all the wells were stained with crystal violet. After lysis with acetic acid 10%,
O.D. was read at 590 nm.
Foci assay
At the end of the selection period (infection) or 6h post-transfection, DU145 or PC3 cells
were trypsinized. 5 × 103 cells were plated on 10cm dishes. 14–21 days later, the plates were
stained with crystal violet and the foci were counted.
Growth in semisolid medium

The bottom layer was obtained by covering 6-well dishes with 3 ml of 0,6% agar in DMEM.
The day after, 5×104 infected cells were seeded on top in triplicate in 2 ml of 0,3% agar in
DMEM + 10%FBS. Colonies were counted after 3–4 weeks at 40× magnification.
Analysis of PTEN and PTENP1 genomic status and expression

Author Manuscript

Breast Cancer: Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Mapping 500K Array datasets GSE7545 and
GSE16619 were downloaded from NCBI GEO and analyzed with the Partek Genomic Suite
(Partek Inc) for detection of genomic regions with alterations and data visualization. Copy
number aberrations were scored with the Partek segmentation algorithm with default
paramaters: p-value cutoff at 0.001 for neighboring regions with significantly different
means, 10 minimum number of probe sets required for any candidate region, 0.3 signal to
noise difference as minimum magnitude of change, and p-value threshold 0.01 for one-sided
t-test of probes in each region to be considered as significantly deviated from the expected
normal. All aberrations were calculated with respect to a set of 270 HapMap-normal
persons. 118 breast cancer samples and 44 normal samples were included in the study.

Colon Cancer: GSE16125 sporadic colon cancer raw datasets were downloaded from NCBI
GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16125). There are
two chip platforms employed in this dataset: 48 sporadic colon cancer samples interrogated
by Affymetrix GeneChip(r) Human Mapping 250K Nsp SNP Array and 36 of them analyzed
by Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. The SNP array raw datasets were analyzed with
the Partek Genomic Suite (Partek Inc) for detection of genomic regions with alterations and
data visualization (Partek smoothing algorithm was based on 46 probes). Fortyeight normal
samples from the HapMap project supplied by Affymetrix were used as an un-paired
reference set [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/500k_data.affx].
Raw exon array intensity CEL files for colon cancer and normal colon were analyzed by
Affymetrix Power Tools (APT, v. 1.12.0). Normalized intensity value for PTEN was
calculated as average of 8 probes corresponding to two PTEN specific exon probe set
"3256703" and "3256704". These values were extracted out by APT software. Affymetrix
Human Exon 1.0 ST Array dataset for normal colon epithelial cells was downloaded from
NCBI GEO GSE1916 dataset (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?
acc=GSE19163). The correlation plot with r and p values between log10 PTEN expression
intensity and log-ratio of PTENP1 copy number was generated in GraphPad Prism

(GraphPad Software, Inc.). The log-ratio of PTENP1 was based on average of 14 SNP
probes flanking PTENP1 gene.
Statistical analysis
In vitro data were analyzed using unpaired t-test (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, Inc.)
Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p <
0.001. The mean ± s.d. of three or more independent experiments is reported. Regression
analyses and correlation coefficients were generated using GraphPad Prism, GraphPad
