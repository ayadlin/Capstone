ABSTRACT
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the accumulation
of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, with drug resistance being a major cause of
therapeutic failure. We established a carfilzomib-resistant derivative of the LP-1 MM
cell line (LP-1/Cfz) and found that the transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2
(Nrf2; gene symbol NFE2L2) contributes to carfilzomib resistance. The mechanism of
Nrf2 activation involved enhanced translation of Nrf2 as well as its positive regulator,
the autophagy receptor sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62. The eukaryotic translation
initiation factor gene EIF4E3 was among the Nrf2 target genes upregulated in LP-1/
Cfz cells, suggesting existence of a positive feedback loop. In line with this, we found
that siRNA knockdown of eIF4E3 decreased Nrf2 protein levels. On the other hand,
elevated SQSTM1/p62 levels were due at least in part to activation of the PERKeIF2α pathway. LP-1/Cfz cells had decreased levels of reactive oxygen species as
well as elevated levels of fatty acid oxidation and prosurvival autophagy. Genetic
and pharmacologic inhibition of the Nrf2-EIF4E3 axis or the PERK-eIF2α pathway,
disruption of redox homeostasis or inhibition of fatty acid oxidation or autophagy
conferred sensitivity to carfilzomib. Our findings were supported by clinical data
where increased EIF4E3 expression was predictive of Nrf2 target gene upregulation
in a subgroup of patients with chemoresistant minimal residual disease and relapsed/
refractory MM. Thus, our data offer a preclinical rationale for including inhibitors of
the SQSTM1/p62-Nrf2 pathway to the treatment regimens for certain advanced stage
MM patients.

INTRODUCTION

ultimately relapse because the MM cells develop resistance
to the treatment [4, 5]. Carfilzomib, a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor that exhibits enhanced selectivity for
the proteasome [6], received full approval from the FDA
for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MM
in January 2016 [7]. However, the overall response rate
to carfilzomib in the pivotal phase 2 clinical trial was less
than 25% [8]. Furthermore, in a subsequent phase 3 study
— in which overall survival was the primary endpoint
[9] — carfilzomib monotherapy failed to significantly
improve the survival of relapsed/refractory MM patients
compared to those who received best supportive care (10.2
months vs 10.0 months) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy
characterized by the clonal expansion of neoplastic plasma
cells in the bone marrow. The introduction of novel agents
such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory
drugs has prolonged the lives of patients with MM over
the past decade [1]. The first-in-class proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib provided proof-of-principle that proteasome
inhibition is an important therapeutic target in MM,
leading to its FDA approval as frontline therapy in June
2008 [2]. Despite overall response rates of 100% in the
setting of newly diagnosed disease [3], most MM patients

NCT01302392). These results indicate that the majority
of MM cells that became resistant to bortezomib were
also resistant to carfilzomib. Clearly, to extend the life
expectancy of patients with this disease, it is essential
to characterize the mechanisms conferring resistance to
proteasome inhibitors.
To begin to understand the underlying processes that
might be relevant to clinical carfilzomib resistance in MM,
we previously established carfilzomib-resistant derivatives
of MM cell lines, KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz [10,
11]. In both cases, prosurvival autophagy was shown to
contribute to carfilzomib resistance mediated, in part, via
transcriptional upregulation of the SQSTM1 gene encoding
sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) [11]. SQSTM1/p62
is a multifunctional scaffold protein that interacts with
various signaling molecules and serves as a ubiquitinbinding cargo receptor connecting the proteasomal and
autophagic protein degradation pathways [12]. Another
important function of SQSTM1/p62 is activation of the
transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2)related factor 2 (Nrf2; gene symbol NFE2L2) in the
Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway [13, 14]. The Keap1Nrf2 pathway maintains cellular redox homeostasis by
inducing antioxidant and detoxification genes and by
modulating energy metabolism [15]. A growing body of
evidence implicates activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway
as a contributor to therapy resistance [16] but, to our
knowledge, its role in conferring resistance to carfilzomib
in MM cells has not been described.
The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is tightly regulated at
multiple levels, the precise details of which are currently
being elucidated [17]. Under basal conditions, Nrf2
monomers are sequestered in cytoplasmic complexes
through two-site binding to Keap1 homodimers which
target Nrf2 for continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation [18]. In response to oxidative stress, the
Keap1 molecules are modified such that ubiquitination
of Nrf2 is inhibited and it remains bound to the complex
[19, 20]. In a variation on this theme, overexpressed
SQSTM1/p62 binds to and competitively prevents Keap1
from interacting with one of the Nrf2 sites, effecting
a conformational change in the complex which leads
to impaired ubiquitination of associated Nrf2 [13, 14].
In both scenarios, newly synthesized Nrf2 escapes
cytoplasmic sequestration by Keap1 and is free to
translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
Of relevance in this regard, a number of reports have
indicated that Nrf2 expression is subject to diverse
mechanisms of translational control [21-25].
Nrf2 activity can also be modulated by other
mechanisms [26-29]. For example, nuclear translocation
and activation of Nrf2 is enhanced by phosphorylation
by the PERK protein kinase [26, 27]. PERK is activated
upon accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in
the endoplasmic reticulum which results in the induction
of an “unfolded protein response” (UPR) [30]. The best
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

characterized function of PERK on UPR induction is to
provide a protective advantage to the cell by attenuating
global protein translation via inhibitory phosphorylation of
eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) [31, 32].
Phosphorylation of eIF2α also results in the preferential
translation of certain mRNAs containing upstream open
reading frames (uORFs), the prototypical example of
which is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [33].
During this phase of the UPR, ATF4 and Nrf2 coregulate
transcription of some cytoprotective genes [34, 35].
However, if proteostasis is not restored, ATF4 induces
a cell death program involving the CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP) transcription
factor [36].
Here we report the establishment of a new
carfilzomib-resistant derivative of the LP-1 MM cell
line, LP-1/Cfz, in which carfilzomib resistance was
characterized by induction of prosurvival autophagy as
well as Nrf2 pathway activation associated with elevated
SQSTM1/p62 levels. Unlike carfilzomib-resistant KMS11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells, increased SQSTM1/p62
levels were not due to transcriptional upregulation of the
SQSTM1 gene [11]. Rather, the higher levels of SQSTM1/
p62 were due to increased translation dependent in part
on activation of the PERK-eIF2α axis. Comparative
analysis with KMS-11/Cfz cells revealed Nrf2 target gene
induction as well but only LP-1/Cfz cells were sensitized
to carfilzomib by inhibition of the PERK-eIF2α signaling
cascade. Additionally, LP-1/Cfz cells exhibited increased
Nrf2 synthesis associated with elevated expression of
Nrf2 targets involved in translation initiation, in particular,
EIF4E3 encoding an atypical eukaryotic translation
initiation factor family member recently demonstrated
to mediate context-specific translation in diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma [37, 38]. Moreover, gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) of gene expression profiling data from
MM patient samples showed that increased EIF4E3
expression was predictive of Nrf2 activation in some
chemoresistant minimal residual disease and relapsed/
refractory MM cases. These findings have elucidated
further complexities of the proteostasis network in MM
cells and provide preclinical rationale for therapeutic
development of SQSTM1/p62-Nrf2 inhibitors as a means
to overcome proteasome inhibitor resistance in a subgroup
of advanced stage MM patients.

drug (4 nM to 12 nM) over an 18 week period according
to a previously published protocol used to derive the
carfilzomib-resistant MM cell lines, KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz [11] (Figure S1). As observed for KMS11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells, LP-1/Cfz cells retained
resistance to carfilzomib even when tested after removal
of selective pressure for approximately 8 weeks. Gene
expression profiling was performed on LP-1/Cfz and
parental LP-1 cells, and GSEA was used to identify
differentially overrepresented pathways and processes
associated with carfilzomib resistance shared between
LP-1/Cfz cells and the KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cell
lines [11].
We first applied GSEA to examine gene sets from
the C3:TFT (transcription factor targets) subcollection of
the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Binding
site motifs for the “cap ‘n’ collar” transcription factors
NF-E2 (V$NFE2_01) and Nrf2 (V$NRF2_Q4) that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recognize a similar AP1-like core consensus sequence
(TGA(G/C/T)TCA) [40] were significantly enriched in
genes with increased expression in LP-1/Cfz and KMS11/Cfz cells (Figure S2). Although NF-E2 expression is
restricted to erythroid cells, Nrf2 is broadly expressed
and activated in response to stress [41, 42]. In line with
Nrf2 activation in both carfilzomib-resistant MM models,
significant enrichment of Nrf2 target genes (NFE2L2.V2
gene set) was observed when GSEA was applied to the C6
(oncogenic signatures) collection of MSigDB (Figure 1).
GSEA detects coordinated expression changes in
groups of genes by taking all genes into account, even if
individual representatives of the groups exhibit modest
changes [43]. In a second, complementary approach, we
employed fold change (FC) cutoffs to compare similar
numbers of differentially expressed genes in LP-1/Cfz
(FC ≥ 1.7; 896 probe sets) and KMS-11/Cfz cells (FC
≥ 1.4; 887 probe sets). Transcription factor binding site

motif discovery was carried out using the oPOSSUM-3
Single Site Analysis tool and the JASPAR CORE
vertebrate database [44]. NFE2L2 was the highestscoring motif in KMS-11/Cfz cells and the only motif in
common among the top ten ranked transcription factor
binding sites overrepresented in the promoter regions of
the upregulated genes in both carfilzomib-resistant MM
models (Table 1). This result was notable because an
Nrf2 ChIP-seq dataset was one of the data sources used to
validate the performance of the oPOSSUM-3 program [41,
44]. The Nrf2 ChIP-seq dataset comprised basal (Nrf2-/-)
and inducible (Keap1-/-) direct binding targets of Nrf2 in
mouse embryo fibroblasts [41]. We combined this dataset
with Nrf2 direct binding targets identified by ChiP-seq
experiments in human lymphoblastoid cells after treatment
with the dietary isothiocyanate, sulforaphane [40]. Using
GeneSpring analysis software, we found significant
enrichment of these Nrf2 direct binding targets in the
differentially expressed genes in LP-1/Cfz cells (102 out
of 896 probe sets; P < 10-31) and KMS-11/Cfz cells (107
out of 887 probe sets; P < 10-31) (see Table S1 for the probe
set lists). Moreover, there was also significant overlap
of the differentially expressed genes in the carfilzomibresistant MM cells and genes that were downregulated in
human lymphoblastoid cells after sulforaphane treatment
— LP-1/Cfz cells (72 out of 896 probe sets; P < 10-20) and
KMS-11/Cfz cells (68 out of 887 probe sets; P < 10-20) —
which may represent indirect Nrf2 targets (see Table S2
for the probe set lists).
Strikingly, different Nrf2 target genes were
upregulated in LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz cells.
Prototypical cytoprotective Nrf2 targets, as exemplified
by NQO1 [15], were significantly upregulated in KMS11/
Cfz cells [11] but not in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure 1; Table
S1). These findings suggested differential levels of
Nrf2 activation and/or that the Nrf2-interacting partners
might be different in the two carfilzomib-resistant MM
model systems. In support of the latter possibility, GSEA
indicated activation of a prosurvival ATF4 target gene
response in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure S3A, S3B). GSEA
also showed enrichment of HER2/ERBB2-related
signatures in LP-1/Cfz cells when the C2:CP (canonical
pathways) subcollection of MSigDB was queried (Figure
S3C, S3D). Both factors were previously reported to
cooperate with Nrf2 and modulate specificity of Nrf2
target gene activation [35, 36, 45, 46]. In particular,
a number of the Nrf2 targets upregulated in LP-1/Cfz
cells (indicated in Figure 1A) were previously shown to
be directly coregulated by ATF4 [34, 47]. Regardless of
the different transcriptional outcomes, taken together,
the data implicated activation of Nrf2 pathways in the
acquisition of carfilzomib resistance in both MM models.
In the following experiments, we concentrated mainly
on elucidating the molecular mechanisms and potential
functional significance of Nrf2 pathway activation in
LP-1/Cfz cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We verified the microarray data for selected Nrf2
targets in LP-1/Cfz cells by real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay and western
blot analysis (Figure S4; see also Figure 2C and Figure
9C). We noted that several of the novel Nrf2 targets
are involved in translational control mechanisms; for
example, EEF1A2, EIF4E3, RND3/RhoE (Table S1A) and
FAM129A/Niban (Table S2A). EEF1A2 is a translation
elongation factor gene that was previously shown to
promote survival of mouse plasmacytoma cells [48],
whereas EIF4E3, RND3/RhoE and FAM129A/Niban
encode proteins that participate in various facets of capdependent translation initiation (described in more detail
below) [38, 49, 50].
Of the validated genes, we focused initially on
the autophagy-related gene GABARAPL1 [51] since
it was also significantly upregulated in KMS-11/Cfz
cells (Table S1B). Indeed, inspection of the enriched
V$NFE2_01 transcription factor motif gene set indicated
that GABARAPL1 was the top-ranked upregulated Nrf2
target in common between LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/
Cfz cells (Figure 2A). In this regard, it was noteworthy
that the KEGG autophagy gene set was among the
significantly enriched gene sets in the MSigDB C2:CP
(canonical pathways) collection identified by combined
pairwise comparison of LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz versus
parental LP-1 and KMS-11 cells, and GABARAPL1 was
the top-ranked gene in this instance as well (Figure 2B).
To investigate whether GABARAPL1 is an Nrf2-binding
target in LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz cells, we performed
ChIP-qPCR analysis on the promoter region of the
GABARAPL1 gene.
An evolutionarily conserved Nrf2 motif was
identified in the GABARAPL1 promoter region by
the ConTra v2 transcription factor binding site motif
discovery program using position weight matrices from
both the JASPAR CORE and TRANSFAC database
libraries [52] (Figure S5A). Of note, this motif coincided
with an NF-E2 ChIP-seq binding site identified in K562
erythroid cells by the ENCODE project (Figure S5B).
Using primers flanking this site, we found specific
enrichment of Nrf2-precipitated chromatin in comparison
to the unrelated antibody control precipitation in both MM
cell lines, increased binding of which was observed in the
carfilzomib-resistant derivatives (Figure 2D). This result
is congruent with previous findings of substantial overlap
of functional Nrf2 and NF-E2 binding sites at the genomewide and individual gene levels [40, 42]. Thus, the data
support the notion that GABARAPL1 is a direct Nrf2 target
gene in LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz cells.
GABARAPL1 is involved in selective autophagy
through its interaction with ubiquitin-binding cargo

during the late stages of autophagosome maturation
[54]. Previously, we showed that increased autophagic
flux contributes to carfilzomib resistance in KMS-11/Cfz
cells [11]. Increased staining intensity with the Cyto-ID
autophagy detection reagent revealed that LP-1/Cfz cells
also had higher steady state levels of autophagosomes

(Figure 2E), indicating that activation of the Nrf2GABARAPL1 axis correlates with increased autophagic
activity [55]. We also previously demonstrated that
inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine treatment, which
increases lysosomal pH and blocks autophagosomelysosome fusion, sensitized KMS-11/Cfz cells to

cell line similarly to KMS-11/Cfz cells.

1), GSR (glutathione reductase) and other antioxidantassociated enzymes regulated by Nrf2 require NADPH as
a reducing cofactor [15]. Accordingly, Nrf2 also regulates
several NADPH-generating enzymes. Specifically, Nrf2
facilitates NADPH production by directing carbon flux
through the pentose phosphate pathway [56]. Consistent
with the hypothesis that Nrf2 is activated in LP-1/Cfz
as well as in KMS-11/Cfz cells, NADPH levels were
increased concomitant with upregulation of KEGG
pentose phosphate pathway genes in both models (Figure
S6).
It is becoming increasingly appreciated that Nrf2
also affects multiple aspects of intermediary metabolism
indirectly [15], including mitochondrial fatty acid
oxidation (FAO) [57]. Of note, during the metabolic shift
towards FAO, activation of autophagy hydrolyzes lipids
into fatty acids for fuel [58]. Considering that FAO is

an important source of NADPH in leukemic cells [59],
we examined whether rates of FAO were increased in
carfilzomib-resistant LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz cells.
Increased FAO was observed in LP-1/Cfz versus parental
LP-1 cells (Figure 3A, 3B). By comparison, basal rates of
FAO were already elevated in parental KMS-11 cells and
there was no further increase in KMS-11/Cfz cells (Figure
3C, 3D).
Considered together, the gene expression profiling
and functional assays supporting increased NADPH
production and/or upregulation of genes that detoxify ROS
suggested that LP-1/Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz cells would
exhibit enhanced Nrf2-mediated antioxidant capacity.
To examine this, we measured ROS generation using the
fluorescent redox-sensitive dyes CM-H2DCFDA, which
is specific for hydrogen peroxide, and MitoSOX Red,
which is selective for superoxide [60]. Cells were treated
with varying concentrations of carfilzomib and ROS

levels were quantified by flow cytometry. Lower levels
of ROS were generated in LP-1 cells compared to KMS11 cells under all conditions; at the highest carfilzomib
concentrations, both hydrogen peroxide (Figure 4) and
superoxide (Figure 5) levels were reduced by more than
70% in the carfilzomib-resistant derivatives versus their
parental counterparts.
To determine whether antioxidant defense conferred
protection to carfilzomib in these MM models and whether
there was a contribution of FAO, the cells were cotreated
with carfilzomib and either (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine,

Activation of the PERK-eIF2α axis contributes to
SQSTM1/p62 synthesis and carfilzomib resistance
in LP-1/Cfz cells

the glutathione-based antioxidant system contributes to
carfilzomib resistance in these MM models and that FAO
is a potential source of reducing equivalents underlying
the increased ROS defense.
Finally, to directly test whether Nrf2 activity
contributes to carfilzomib resistance, we transfected
LP-1/Cfz and parental LP-1 cells with two previously
validated Nrf2 siRNAs and a control siRNA with no
known mammalian homology [62, 63]. We confirmed
that Nrf2 mRNA was knocked down ~45-65% by qRTPCR. This was accompanied by an ~30-45% decrease in
GABARAPL1 mRNA levels (Figure 7A). As illustrated
in Figure 7B, both Nrf2 siRNAs sensitized LP-1/Cfz cells
to carfilzomib.

Next, we focused on the molecular mechanisms
underlying Nrf2 activation in LP-1/Cfz cells. Nrf2 mRNA
levels were not significantly increased. However, western
blot analyses showed significantly higher Nrf2 protein
levels in the high salt (nuclear) fraction of LP-1/Cfz cell
lysates compared to parental LP-1 cell lysates (P < 0.001)
(Figure 7C). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
confirmed that Nrf2 had a predominantly perinuclear
and nuclear localization in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure 7D)

[64]. Moreover, treatment with trigonelline, an inhibitor
of Nrf2 nuclear import [63], sensitized LP-1/Cfz cells to
carfilzomib (Figure 7E). Steady state Keap1 levels were
not reduced in LP-1/Cfz cells compared to parental LP-1
cells (Figure 7F). Unexpectedly, however, despite the fact
that SQSTM1 mRNA levels were not increased, SQSTM1/
p62 protein levels were higher in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure
7F).
Kampmann and colleagues recently reported
that knockdown of the 19S proteasome subunit genes
desensitized U266 MM cells to carfilzomib [65]. Because
the 19S regulator delivers substrates to the 20S catalytic

core, they hypothesized that a loss in 19S function may
lead to the selective accumulation of certain proteins.
SQSTM1/p62 was one of the proteins that accumulated
upon knockdown [65]. Congruent with their results,
GSEA indicated that many of the proteasome 19S subunit
genes were downregulated in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure
S7). Therefore, it is possible that this mechanism may
contribute to increased SQSTM1/p62 levels in LP-1/
Cfz cells. However, as described below, we found that
elevated protein synthesis was a contributing factor to
the observed differences in SQSTM1/p62 levels. In this
context, it is worth mentioning that knockdown of the

Induction of Nrf2 target genes in LP-1/Cfz cells
creates a positive feedback loop promoting
eIF4E3-driven Nrf2 translation

components of the eIF4F translation initiation complex
(for example, EIF4E1) and the mechanistic target of
rapamycin (MTOR) [65]. GSEA indicated that both of
these pathways were downregulated in LP-1/Cfz cells:
BIOCARTA_EIF4_PATHWAY (P < 0.001) (Figure
S8A) and HALLMARK_ MTORC1_SIGNALING (P <
0.009) (Figure S8B). Since activation of the PERK-ATF4
pathway was also implicated by GSEA (Figure S3A) and
PERK inhibits mTORC1 during induction of prosurvival
autophagy [66], we assessed potential involvement of
the PERK-eIF2α axis on SQSTM1/p62 translation. For
these studies, we tested a highly selective inhibitor of
PERK kinase activity (GSK2656157) [67] or another
small molecule (ISRIB) which acts downstream and
reverses the effects of phosphorylated eIF2α, thereby
blocking ATF4 synthesis [68]. We found that PERK
inhibition significantly reduced SQSTM1/p62 levels in
LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure 8A) and sensitized LP-1/Cfz cells
to carfilzomib (Figure 8B, top graph). By comparison,
KMS-11/Cfz cells were not sensitized by PERK inhibition
(Figure 8B, bottom graph). Treatment of LP-1/Cfz cells
with ISRIB also decreased SQSTM1/p62 levels (Figure
8C, top panels) (P < 0.03; n = 3) while concomitantly
diminishing ATF4 levels (Figure 8C, bottom panels).
Further, ISRIB treatment sensitized LP-1/Cfz cells to
carfilzomib (Figure 8D). Thus, these results indicated
that activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway contributed
to carfilzomib resistance. Moreover, they argued that
SQSTM1/p62 translation occurs in part via an ATF4-like
uORF-mediated mechanism (see Table S2 of ref. [69] for
details of SQSTM1 uORF-containing transcripts).
Interestingly, we did not observe enrichment of
IRE1 or ATF6 expression signatures corresponding to
the other branches of the UPR in LP-1/Cfz cells. In
fact, GSEA indicated that UPR signaling was attenuated
(HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE
downregulated; Figure S8C). Therefore, the mechanistic
basis for PERK activation in LP-1/Cfz cells is unknown.
However, alternative signals for PERK activation have
recently been uncovered [28, 29, 66, 70]. In particular,
Gupta and colleagues described a noncanonical
mechanism of PERK-Nrf2 activation in the absence of
an endoplasmic reticulum stress response that results
from an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
[28, 70]. Along these lines, enrichment of an EMT-like
expression signature (HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_
MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION) was indicated by
GSEA in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure S8D), and decreased cell
surface expression of E-cadherin compared to parental
LP-1 cells (Figure S8E) is consistent with this as a
contributory mechanism [71, 72].

Although Nrf2 levels are primarily governed by
interaction with Keap1, accumulating evidence has
highlighted the importance of de novo translation [22-24].
Therefore, we were prompted to compare Nrf2 synthesis
in LP-1/Cfz and parental LP-1 cells. For these analyses,
the cells were pretreated with MG-132 to prevent Nrf2
proteasomal degradation. Under these conditions, we
found significantly higher levels of Nrf2 in LP-1/Cfz
cells (Figure 9A). We next tested the effects of 4EGI-1,
an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation that prevents
binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) to
eIF4E family members (the best characterized of which
is eIF4E1) within the eIF4F translation initiation complex
[73]. Inhibition of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction eliminated
the differences in Nrf2 levels between LP-1/Cfz and
parental LP-1 cells (Figure 9B). The data thus indicated
more active cap-dependent synthesis of Nrf2 in LP-1/Cfz
cells. This result was contrary to the GSEA prediction
that canonical eIF4F-mediated translation initiation was
downregulated in LP-1/Cfz compared to parental LP-1
cells (Figure S8A) and suggested the possible involvement
of an alternative eIF4F cap-binding complex containing
another member of the eIF4E family [74]. Along these
lines, it has recently been appreciated that eIF4E3 interacts
with eIF4G and competes with eIF4E1 to form a novel
eIF4F cap-binding complex [37, 38]. Because this Nrf2
target was upregulated at the mRNA level in LP-1/Cfz
cells (Table S1A), we were interested in whether this was
reflected at the level of eIF4E3 protein. We found that the
increased EIF4E3 mRNA levels in LP-1/Cfz cells were
accompanied by elevated eIF4E3 protein levels, whereas
LP-1/Cfz and parental LP-1 cells had similar levels of
eIF4E1 (Figure 9C).
Phosphorylation of eIF4E1 by mitogen-activated
protein kinase interacting kinases (MNK) 1 and 2
stimulates translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding
proteins involved in cancer development and progression
[75]. Gartenhaus and colleagues found that treatment
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells with an MNK
inhibitor, CGP57380, reduced eIF4E1-driven translation
and resulted in a compensatory increase in eIF4E3-driven
translation [38]. To determine whether Nrf2 translation
might be regulated via eIF4E1-eIF4E3 interplay, we
investigated the effect of MNK inhibition on Nrf2 protein
levels in LP-1/Cfz and parental LP-1 cells. We found that
after CGP57380 treatment Nrf2 levels increased in both
cases, with the levels in parental LP-1 cells approaching
those in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure 9B). These findings
supported a role of eIF4E3 in the elevated synthesis of
Nrf2 and the carfilzomib-resistant phenotype of LP-1/
Cfz cells. To directly test this, we transfected LP-1/Cfz

and parental LP-1 cells with two specific EIF4E3 siRNAs
and a negative control siRNA. Figure 9D shows that Nrf2
protein levels decreased with eIF4E3 protein knockdown.
Moreover, eIF4E3 knockdown sensitized LP-1/Cfz cells to
carfilzomib (Figure 9E).
We also examined whether the protein levels of
two other novel Nrf2 targets involved in the control of
cap-dependent translation initiation — RND3/RhoE and
FAM129A/Niban — corresponded with the differential
mRNA levels observed in LP-1/Cfz and LP-1 cells (Figure
S4). FAM129A inhibits PERK-mediated phosphorylation
of eIF2α [50]. Additionally, FAM129A and Rnd3
reciprocally modulate the activity of 4E-BP1, an inhibitor
of eIF4E1 [49, 50]. Briefly, the dephosphorylated form of
4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E1, preventing binding of eIF4G and
formation of the eIF4F complex. mTORC1 phosphorylates
4E-BP1, leading to its dissociation from eIF4E1 which
allows eIF4F formation and translation initiation [75].
FAM129A positively affects mTORC1 phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1, thereby facilitating eIF4E1-driven translation
[50]. In contrast, Rnd3 inhibits mTORC1 phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 which prevents 4E-BP1 disassociation from
eIF4E1 and therefore inhibits eIF4E1 function [49].
This mechanism only pertains to eIF4E1 since 4E-BP1
does not bind to eIF4E3 [74]. FAM129A protein levels
were decreased in LP-1/Cfz cells corresponding with its
diminished mRNA expression. Conversely, Rnd3 protein
levels were increased in LP-1/Cfz cells concomitant with
increased mRNA expression (Figure 9C). Collectively,
these results are consistent with a potential positive
feedback process associated with acquisition of
carfilzomib resistance in LP-1/Cfz cells wherein initial
activation of Nrf2 leads to direct and indirect regulation
of target genes — including transcriptional upregulation
of EIF4E3 — that facilitate enhanced eIF4E3-driven
translation of Nrf2.

RESPONSE downregulated; Figure 10B). Moreover,
GSEA predicted an inverse relationship with an
enrichment pattern corresponding to genes regulated by
EIF4E1 overexpression (Figure 10C).
We also examined patient-paired relapse and
diagnostic samples from 17 MM patients treated with
various regimens (GEO accession number GSE36824)
[77]. EIF4E3 expression was increased in 4 out of 17
cases of disease progression. GSEA indicated that Nrf2
target genes (NFE2L2.V2 gene set) were upregulated
during disease course in these 4 cases (Figure 11A). As
for MRD cells with increased EIF4E3 expression, GSEA
predicted lack of UPR stress in the relapsed MM cells
(HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_ RESPONSE
downregulated; Figure 11B). These relapsed MM cells
also had enrichment of an EMT-like expression signature
(HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_
TRANSITION; Figure 11C). Moreover, genes
upregulated through activation of the mTORC1 complex
were downregulated in these 4 cases (HALLMARK_
MTORC1_SIGNALING; Figure 11D). In addition, GSEA
again predicted an inverse correlation with an EIF4E1specific gene expression signature (Figure 11E). Of the
17 samples, GABARAPL1 expression was increased in
5 cases during disease progression, two of which also
had increased EIF4E3 expression. Performing GSEA
on the combined EIF4E3 plus GABARAPL1 dataset (7
out of 17 cases) indicated activation of Nrf2 signaling
and yielded the same enrichment patterns for the other
pathways identified for the 4 cases with increased EIF4E3
expression (data not shown).
On the other hand, when GSEA was performed on
the 10 relapsed MM patient samples that did not exhibit
increased EIF4E3 or GABARAPL1 expression, the exact
opposite patterns of enrichment were obtained. In these
cases, a positive correlation with EIF4E1-upregulated
genes was observed during disease progression (Figure
11F) concomitant with a prediction of increased mTORC1
signaling (Figure S9A). Although a UPR was predicted
(Figure S9B), Nrf2 target genes were downregulated
(Figure S9C) and a reverse EMT-like expression signature
(i.e., mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) was suggested
(Figure S9D). Therefore, these parameters appeared
to separate the relapsed MM samples into two distinct
groups: one, “LP-1/Cfz-like”, characterized by increased
EIF4E3 (and/or GABARAPL1) expression having
activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and a second
group (“eIF4E1-like”) exhibiting the opposite phenotype
and pathway activation states in which enhanced eIF4E1driven translation was implied.

Increased EIF4E3 expression predicts Nrf2 target
gene activation in minimal residual disease and
relapsed MM patient samples
To assess the clinical relevance of our findings,
we analyzed three independent publicly available gene
expression datasets of MM patients. We first examined
the gene expression profiles of chemoresistant minimal
residual disease (MRD) and matched diagnostic samples
from MM patients included in the GEM2010MAS65
clinical trial (GEO accession number GSE70399) [76].
Notably, EIF4E3 expression was found to be increased
in 5 out of 7 MRD samples (FC = 1.25; P = 0.013).
When GSEA was applied to these 5 cases, significant
upregulation of Nrf2 target genes (NFE2L2.V2 gene set)
was observed in the persisting MRD cells (Figure 10A).
As was found for LP-1/Cfz cells, UPR signaling was

reprogramming of MM cells, modulating redox and energy
homeostasis via elevated FAO and inducing prosurvival
autophagy involving GABARAPL1 upregulation [15, 2629, 34-36]. We suggest that the increased SQSTM1/p62
levels allow newly synthesized Nrf2 to escape Keap1mediated sequestering in the cytoplasm [13, 14], resulting
in the regulation of a subset of its target genes, including
EIF4E3, which in turn facilitate enhanced translation of
Nrf2 and establish a positive feedback loop. While further
mechanistic studies are required to fully define the role
played by SQSTM1/p62 in carfilzomib resistance, we
demonstrated the direct involvement of Nrf2 by genetic
and pharmacologic inhibition and a contribution of PERK
using two highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of the
PERK-eIF2α axis [67, 68].
Previously we reported that acquisition of
carfilzomib resistance in KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz
MM cells was associated with prosurvival autophagy
involving SQSTM1/p62 [11]. Comparative analyses
of KMS-11/Cfz cells herein also revealed activation of
Nrf2 target genes (Figure 1B). Carfilzomib resistance
in KMS-11/Cfz cells is associated with KLF4-mediated
transcriptional upregulation of SQSTM1 expression [11].
Others have described the establishment of a positive
feedback loop in which Nrf2 transcriptionally activates
SQSTM1 [13, 14] (highlighted in Figure S1B). We note
that KLF4 is also an Nrf2 target gene (Table S1B), so we
envision a model in KMS-11/Cfz cells wherein KLF4
and Nrf2 cooperate to transcriptionally maintain elevated
SQSTM1/p62 levels.
GSEA revealed that activation of the PERK-eIF2α
axis in LP-1/Cfz cells was not associated with induction of
a UPR (Figure S8C). Gupta and colleagues have described

the PROGgeneV2 prognostic biomarker identification
tool [81] as previously described [11], we performed
a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis on 546
newly diagnosed MM patients treated on the UARK 98026 TT2 and UARK 2003-033 TT3 clinical trials [80].
The hazard ratio (HR) for patients with high versus low
WHSC1 expression was 1.3 (95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.1-1.54; P < 0.002). As shown in Figure 12A, highlevel coexpression of EIF4E3 resulted in increased risk
of mortality (HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.17-2.21; P < 0.004),
which was higher than the increased risk score predicted
by high-level coexpression of EIF4E1 (HR = 1.45; 95%
CI, 1.04-2.02; P < 0.03) (Figure 12B).

DISCUSSION
Despite improved outcomes with the introduction
of novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors to MM
treatment regimens over the past decade, patients
inevitably succumb to their disease because the MM
cells become resistant to the drugs [1]. MM cells can
develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors through a
variety of mechanisms [4]. However, it is still unclear
which mechanisms explain clinical proteasome inhibitor
resistance.
In this paper we report the establishment of a new
carfilzomib-resistant MM cell line derivative, LP-1/Cfz,
in which elevated levels of the SQSTM1/p62 ubiquitinbinding cargo receptor were associated with carfilzomib
resistance that comprised both prosurvival autophagy
and Nrf2 pathway activation. Our results support a model
wherein activation of the SQSTM1/p62-Nrf2 pathway
— in concert with the PERK-eIF2α/ATF4 axis — directs

SLAMF7 encoding the plasma cell-specific CD319 cell
surface marker, reflecting a partial reversal of plasma
cell maturation (Table S1A). Conversely, MHC class II
antigen expression was diminished, which is reminiscent
of plasmacytic differentiation (Table S2A). In this latter
respect, LP-1/Cfz cells might resemble in part the situation
observed in mantle cell lymphoma where bortezomib
resistance increased with plasmacytic differentiation [93].
Accordingly, LP-1/Cfz cells may have attained the ‘‘sweet
spot’’ maturation stage intrinsically less susceptible
to proteasome inhibition proposed by Tiedemann and
colleagues [92].
Our results indicating a role of Nrf2 activation in
experimental carfilzomib resistance parallel those of
others wherein Nrf2 target gene activation was associated
with poor responsiveness to bortezomib in mouse and
human MM models [94, 95]. In this regard, both LP-1/
Cfz and KMS-11/Cfz exhibit some cross-resistance to
bortezomib (Figure S1). In that various regimens were
used in the treatment of the MM patients that we analyzed
[76, 77, 80], we cannot conclude that increased EIF4E3
expression can be used as a specific indicator of clinical
carfilzomib resistance. Nonetheless, the finding that
EIF4E3 expression is increased in certain chemoresistant
minimal residual disease and relapsed MM patient
samples and is predictive of Nrf2 target gene activation,
strongly suggests that the Nrf2-EIF4E3 axis and eIF4E3driven translation contributes to MM drug resistance
mechanisms in the clinical setting. On the other hand,
lack of EIF4E3 expression in relapsed samples was able
to distinguish a second group of MM patient samples
exhibiting the opposite phenotype and pathway activation
states in which enhanced eIF4E1-driven translation was
indicated. These findings are consistent with the results
of other studies demonstrating a role of eIF4E1 in MM
biology and proteasome inhibitor resistance [65, 96-98]. It
is particularly noteworthy therefore — especially in view
of the documented oncogenic activity of EIF4E1 [75] —
that WHSC1-expressing MM patients with high EIF4E3
expression had less favorable outcomes than those with
high EIF4E1 expression (Figure 12).
In summary, our finding of noncanonical SQSTM1/
p62-Nrf2 pathway activation adds to the growing
appreciation from our work and others that carfilzomib
resistance in MM can arise via multiple mechanisms
[10, 11, 65, 85, 99]. MM is heterogeneous in its etiology
and progression so these varied results are not entirely
unexpected [100]. Collectively, our studies suggest
several approaches to sensitize drug-resistant MM cells
to carfilzomib [10, 11]. In particular, the data presented
herein support the development of novel therapies
targeting the SQSTM1/p62-Nrf2 pathway for a subgroup
of advanced stage MM patients with eIF4E3-driven
translation.

a noncanonical mechanism of PERK-Nrf2 activation in the
absence of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response that
involves an EMT-like adaptation [28, 70]. Enrichment of
an EMT-like expression signature was predicted by GSEA
for LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure S8D) and for relapsed MM
patient samples with increased EIF4E3 expression (Figure
11C). Further investigation of an EMT-related mechanism
is underway and our preliminary studies are suggestive
of crosstalk among Nrf2, ERBB2 and hypoxia signaling
pathways [82, 83]. Indeed, our ongoing examination of
LP-1/Cfz cells indicates that they exhibit intermediate
EMT-like characteristics [84]. Of relevance in this regard,
a recent study by Orlowski and colleagues identified
low levels of TJP1 encoding the epithelial marker tight
junction protein 1 (also known as zonula occludens 1) as
a determinant of myeloma proteasome inhibitor resistance
[85]. During EMT, intercellular junctions are disrupted
and TJP1 is coordinately downregulated with E-cadherin
[86]. Interestingly, TJP1 expression was decreased in
KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells but increased in
LP-1/Cfz cells (our unpublished results). While Nrf2
has been demonstrated to downregulate E-cadherin
expression [72], it has been implicated in the upregulation
of TJP1 expression [87]. Intriguingly, Orlowski and
colleagues reported that proteasome inhibitor sensitivity
associated with increased TJP1 expression was due to
suppression of expression of the PSMB8 gene encoding
the immunoproteasome β5i/LMP7 (chymotrypsin-like)
subunit targeted by carfilzomib and bortezomib as well as
the PSMB9 gene encoding the β1i/LMP2 (caspase-like)
subunit that is also targeted by bortezomib [85]. In accord
with their findings of an inverse relationship with TJP1
expression, both PSMB8 and PSMB9 were downregulated
in LP-1/Cfz cells (Figure S7). In their model, this
apparently occurred through TJP1-mediated suppression
of EGFR/ERBB2 signaling [85]. As TJP1 also interacts
with GABARAPL1 through the CUL3-KBTBD6/
KBTBD7 ubiquitin ligase in the autophagy network
[53], we speculate that complex interplay between Nrf2GABARAPL1/TJP1 and ERBB2 signaling pathways may
underlie the carfilzomib-resistant LP-1/Cfz phenotype
(Figure S3C, S3D) [45, 46, 88, 89].
Carfilzomib resistance in the KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz models was characterized by a partial
reversal of plasma cell maturation [11]. These results are
in line with the findings of others showing that primary
MM cells are capable of dedifferentiating into a less
mature MM phenotype conferring experimental and
clinical drug resistance [90-92]. It is notable that LP-1/Cfz
cells did not fully recapitulate this pattern. Parental LP-1
cells exhibit a membrane phenotype that is intermediate
between late B lymphocytes and plasma cells based on
MHC class II antigen expression [39]. Like the KMS-11/
Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz carfilzomib-resistant MM models
[11], acquisition of carfilzomib resistance in LP-1/
Cfz cells was accompanied by decreased expression of
