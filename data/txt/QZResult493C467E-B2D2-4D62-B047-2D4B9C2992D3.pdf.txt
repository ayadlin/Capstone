Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, identiﬁcation and combined use
of adjuvant compounds that can overcome drug resistance may improve the efﬁcacy of cancer therapy. We
screened extracts of Verticillium species-infected mushrooms for antitumor compounds and identiﬁed the
compound Verticillin A as an inducer of hepatoma cell apoptosis in vitro and an inhibitor of tumor xenograft
growth in vivo. Verticillin A exhibited a potent apoptosis-sensitizing activity in human colon carcinoma cells
exposed to TRAIL or Fas in vitro. Furthermore, Verticillin A effectively sensitized metastatic human colon
carcinoma xenograft to TRAIL-mediated growth inhibition in vivo. At the molecular level, we observed that
Verticillin A induces cell-cycle arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle in human colon carcinoma cells, markedly
upregulating BNIP3 in both hepatoma and colon carcinoma cells. Notably, silencing BNIP3 decreased the
sensitivity of tumor cells to Verticillin A–induced apoptosis in the absence or presence of TRAIL. We found that
the BNIP3 promoter is methylated in both human hepatoma and colon carcinoma cells and tumor specimens.
Verticillin A upregulated the expression of a panel of genes known to be regulated at the level of DNA methylation,
in support of the concept that Verticillin A may act by demethylating the BNIP3 promoter to upregulate BNIP3
expression. Taken together, our ﬁndings identify Verticillin A as a potent apoptosis sensitizer with great promise
for further development as an adjuvant agent to overcome drug resistance in human cancer therapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The ideal cancer therapy should meet 2 criteria: ﬁrst, the
therapeutic agent has to be effective in killing cancer cells; and
second, the agent needs to exhibit low toxicity by showing
selectivity for the cancer cells and avoiding systemic or offtarget toxicity. Currently, cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and the high cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents are the 2 major problems in human cancer therapy (1).
Cancer cells may be intrinsically resistant to chemotherapeutic
drugs, especially to cytotoxic agents, prior to treatment.
Tumors can also acquire resistance during treatment. Drug
resistance, whether intrinsic or acquired, is believed to account

for treatment failure in more than 90% of patients with
metastatic cancer (1). Therefore, ﬁnding ways to overcome
drug resistance may greatly improve the survival of patients
with cancer. Multiple mechanisms confer cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs; however, when it comes to
effective eradication of cancer cells by chemotherapies, all
roads lead to apoptosis. Essentially, most cytotoxic anticancer
drugs currently in clinical use or in clinical trials kill cancer
cells through inducing apoptosis. Thus, tumor cell resistance
to apoptosis, whether intrinsic or acquired, represents a major
challenge in chemotherapeutic intervention of cancer, especially metastatic cancer.
TRAIL (also known as TNFSF10 or APO2L) has been under
intense study for its obvious potential as a selective anticancer
agent in cancer therapy because it preferentially induces
apoptosis in tumor cells but not in normal cells (2, 3).
TRAIL-based cancer therapies are now in multiple phase I
and II clinical trials to treat human cancer including metastatic
human colorectal cancer. However, although human patients
exhibit excellent tolerance to humanized TRAIL receptor
agonist monoclonal antibodies (mAb), the efﬁcacy of these
TRAIL receptor agonist mAbs so far is disappointing. This poor
efﬁcacy is obviously expected because most cancer cells,
especially metastatic cancer cells, often exhibit a TRAIL resistance phenotype (4–8).
To increase the efﬁcacy of TRAIL-based therapy, various
therapeutic agents have been tested for their effectiveness in

enhancing TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines and in
human cancer patients (4, 9–17). These therapeutic agents
have shown great promise in enhancing TRAIL efﬁcacy. However, because the most attractive feature of TRAIL therapy is its
tumor selectivity–conferred low toxicity, combining cytotoxic
agents with TRAIL may bring back toxicity associated with the
therapeutic agents. Therefore, identifying novel TRAIL sensitizers with low toxicity and high sensitization activity is
urgently needed for TRAIL-based cancer therapy. We report
here the identiﬁcation and characterization of Verticillin A, a
natural compound from pathogen-infected mushroom, as a
potent TRAIL sensitizer. Our data suggest that Verticillin A
holds great promise for further development as a potent
sensitizer to enhance the efﬁcacy of TRAIL-based and potentially other cytotoxic agent–based therapies against human
colorectal cancer.

Materials and Methods
Puriﬁcation and identiﬁcation of Verticillin A
The fresh fruiting bodies of Verticillin species–infected mushroom (Amanita ﬂavorubescens Alk) were lyophilized and then
extracted successively with light petroleum and ethyl acetate.
The ethyl acetate extract was fractionated by countercurrent
chromatography using a 2-phase solvent system composed of
light petroleum, chloroform, and acetonitrile with a volume
ratio of 6:1:3. Fractions that exhibited signiﬁcant cytotoxicity
were subjected to semipreparative chromatography on a
reverse-phase C8 column (Hypersil ODS 20  250 mm2),
followed by elution with a mixture of acetonitrile and water
with a gradient from 10% to 100%. The structures of puriﬁed
cytotoxic compounds were determined by electrospray mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) and 1- and 2-dimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.
Cell lines
All cell lines except MPNST-724 used in this study were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
ATCC characterizes these cells by morphology, immunology,
DNA ﬁngerprinting, and cytogenetics. MPNST-724 has been
previously characterized (18).
Reagents
Recombinant TRAIL protein was expressed and puriﬁed as
previously described (19). TRAIL receptor DR5 agonist mAb,
CD3 mAb (OKT3), and CD28 mAb (CD28.2) were obtained from
BioLegend. Etoposide and cisplatin were obtained from Sigma.
Mega-Fas Ligand (FasL; kindly provided by Drs. Steven Butcher
and Lars Damstrup, Topotarget A/S) is a recombinant fusion
protein that consists of 3 human FasL extracellular domains
linked to a protein backbone comprising the dimmer-forming
collagen domain of human adiponectin. The Mega-Fas Ligand
was produced as a glycoprotein in mammalian cells in Topotarget A/S.
Mice
Athymic mice were obtained from the NCI-Frederick mouse
facility. Six- to eight-week-old female mice were used. Experi-

ments and care/welfare were in agreement with federal regulations and an approved protocol by the GHSU/IACUC
committee.
Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Cell viability assay was carried out using the MTT Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (ATCC). For the DNA fragmentation
assay, genomic DNA was isolated from cells and analyzed by
agarose gel electrophoresis. For the quantitative apoptosis
assay, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of
recombinant TRAIL protein with or without Verticillin A
(20), followed by staining with propidium iodide (PI; Trevigen)
or PI plus Alex Fluor 647 Annexin V (BioLegend) and analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry.
Cell surface marker analysis
Tumor cells were stained with anti-TRAIL receptor DR4,
DR5, T-R3, and T-R4 mAbs or an isotype-matched control
IgG (Alexis Biochemicals) as previously described (20). For
Fas receptor analysis, tumor cells were stained with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated anti-human Fas mAb
(BD Biosciences). The stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry.
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) and used for semiquantitative and real-time
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of gene expression as described (21, 22). The PCR primer sequences are listed
in Supplementary Table S1.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was conducted as previously
described (20). The following primary antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling Biotech: anti-FLIP (1:250 dilution), anti-cIAP1 (1:250), anti-xIAP (1:500), anti-Bad (1:1,000),
anti-Bok (1:1,000), anti-p53 (1:500), anti-PUMA (1:2,000), and
anti-cleaved PARP (1:500). The following primary antibodies
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-Bax
(1:2,000), anti-survivin (1:100), anti-Mcl-1 (1:100), and antiBNIP3 (1:100). Anti-b-actin was obtained from Sigma and used
at 1:8,000 dilution.
In vivo tumor growth inhibition
For HepG2 tumor, athymic mice were subcutaneously inoculated with the tumor cells. The control mice were given saline.
The treatment group was intravenously injected with Verticillin A at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively.
Seven mice were used in each group. For SW620 tumors,
SW620 cells (3  106 cells per mouse) were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice at the right ﬂank. Three days later,
the tumor-bearing mice were treated with Verticillin A (0.125
mg/kg body weight, n ¼ 6), TRAIL (100 mg per mouse, n ¼ 5),
and Verticillin A plus TRAIL (n ¼ 5) every 2 days for 14 days.
Tumor size was measured in 2 dimensions with a digital
micrometer caliper at the indicated time points. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula (tumor length  tumor
width2)/2.

Verticillin A Overcomes Drug Resistance in Colon Cancer

Cell-cycle analysis
Cell cycle was analyzed as previously described (19).
MS-PCR analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Sodium bisulﬁte treatment of genomic DNA was carried
out using CpGenome Universal DNA modiﬁcation kit (Chemicon). Methylation-sensitive (MS)-PCR was carried out as
previously described (23). The PCR primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Gene silencing
Scramble siRNA (Dharmacon) and human BNIP3-speciﬁc
siRNA (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-37451) were used. For HepG2 cells,
tumor cells were transiently transfected with the siRNAs using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for approximately 24 hours.
Cells were then harvested and reseeded in 24-well plates in the
absence or presence of 200 nmol/L Verticillin A for approximately 24 hours before analysis for apoptosis. For SW620 cells,
cells were transfected with scramble siRNA or BNIP3-speciﬁc
siRNAs. Verticillin A was added to the transfection culture 6
hours later to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 nmol/L and the cells
were cultured overnight. Cells were then harvested and
reseeded in the presence of 10 nmol/L Verticillin A with or
without TRAIL (10 ng/mL) for another 24 hours and analyzed
for apoptosis.

Statistical analysis
Where indicated, data were represented as the means  SD.
Statistical analysis was conducted using 2-sided t test, with
values of P < 0.05 considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Puriﬁcation and identiﬁcation of Verticillin A as an
antitumor cytotoxic agent
The fresh bodies of mushroom (Amanita ﬂavorubescens
Alk) infected by fungus Verticillium species were extracted,
fractionated, and screened for antitumor cytotoxicity. From
approximately 1,500 g fresh mushrooms, we puriﬁed a
compound (10 mg) with 99% purity and potent inhibitory
activity against HepG2 cells. This compound has a formula
of C30H28N6O6S4 and a molecular weight of 696.3. Analysis
with ESI-MS and NMR spectrometry, in combination with
comparing the crystal structure with the database (24),
identiﬁed this compound as Verticillin A (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Verticillin A inhibits the growth of hepatoma cells in vitro
Verticillin A exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on HepG2
cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of
approximately 62 nmol/L based on MTT assays (Fig. 1A).

into athymic mice (n ¼ 7 per group). The tumor-bearing mice were treated with Verticillin A at the indicated doses, and tumor growth was measured over
time after Verticillin A treatment.  , P < 0.05.

analyzed for PARP cleavage by Western blot analysis (right).

PARP cleavage, and genomic DNA fragmentation, revealed that
Verticillin A increased PI and Annexin V double-positive cells
and induced PARP cleavage and genomic DNA fragmentation
in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Our data
thus suggest that Verticillin A inhibits HepG2 cell growth at
least partially through inducing apoptosis.
To determine whether the growth-inhibitory effect of Verticillin A can be extended to in vivo tumor growth inhibition,
HepG2 cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice.
Tumor-bearing mice were then treated with Verticillin A by
intravenous injection. Verticillin A inhibited tumor growth in a
dose-dependent manner, with signiﬁcant inhibition of HepG2
tumor growth at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (Fig. 1C).
Verticillin A is a potent suppressor of multiple types of
tumor cells
To determine whether Verticillin A inhibits the growth of
other types of tumor cells, 6 types of tumor cells were cultured

in the presence of different concentrations of Verticillin A and
examined for their growth in vitro. Verticillin A signiﬁcantly
inhibited the growth of all of these tumor cells. More importantly, Verticillin A inhibited the growth of these tumor cells
with concentrations in the nanomolar range with IC50 from 30
to 122 nmol/L (Supplementary Table S2). To test the toxicity of
Verticillin A to normal human cells, we cultured normal human
colon epithelial cell line CCD-841 in the presence of Verticillin
A and determined that IC50 is 666.7 nmol/L. As expected, CCD841 is not sensitive to TRAIL, and Verticillin A exhibited nosensitization effect on CCD-841 cell sensitivity to TRAIL (Supplementary Fig. S2). We then obtained human white blood cells
from 2 normal donors and stimulated the T cells in anti-CD3/
anti-CD28–coated 96-well plates for 2 days. Verticillin A was
then added to the culture for another 24 hours. The IC50 values
were 65.1 and 78.8 nmol/L, respectively, for donors 1 and 2. As
expected, the activated human normal T cells are not sensitive
to TRAIL, and Verticillin A exhibited a small degree of effect on

activated human T-cell sensitivity to TRAIL (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Verticillin A is a potent apoptosis sensitizer that
overcomes TRAIL resistance in the metastatic human
colon carcinoma cells
Combinational therapy has been shown often to be effective than single-agent therapy in suppression of tumor cell
growth (25). SW620 is a metastatic human colon carcinoma
cell line that is highly resistant to therapeutic agents including TRAIL (Fig. 2A; ref. 26). We observed that in addition to
its ability to inhibit SW620 cell growth, Verticillin A also
effectively sensitized SW620 cells to TRAIL, and TRAIL
agonist mAb induced cell death at a concentration as low
as 10 nmol/L (Fig. 2A). The sensitization effect of Verticillin
A was also observed in 6 other human colon carcinoma cells
(Fig. 2B). Next, we examined the sensitization effects of
Verticillin A in other types of tumor cells. Pretreatment of
sarcoma (MPNST724), lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and
mammary carcinoma (MCF-7) with Verticillin A also significantly increased the tumor cells sensitivity to TRAILinduced cell death (Fig. 2C). Analysis of tumor cell death
using PI and Annexin V double staining and PARP cleavage
indicated that combination treatment of Verticillin A and
TRAIL induces apoptosis in SW620 cells (Fig. 2D).
Verticillin A is also a potent apoptosis sensitizer that
overcomes resistance to FasL-induced cell death
Because Fas-mediated and TRAIL-induced apoptosis share
similar signaling pathways, we next tested whether Verticillin
A also sensitizes tumor cells to FasL-induced cell death.
Verticillin A pretreatment signiﬁcantly increased SW620 cells
to FasL-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S3). We next
extended our study to the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide
and cisplatin, 2 anticancer drugs that kill tumor cells by
inducing apoptosis. SW620 cells were essentially resistant to
both etoposide and cisplatin. Verticillin A dramatically sensitized SW620 cells to both etoposide- and cisplatin-induced cell
death (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Verticillin A overcomes metastatic human colon
carcinoma TRAIL resistance in vivo
To determine whether the observation that Verticillin A
effectively sensitizes metastatic colon carcinoma cells to
TRAIL-induced cell death in vitro can be extended to enhance
TRAIL-mediated tumor suppression in vivo, SW620 cells were
injected subcutaneously into athymic mice. Verticillin A and
TRAIL, either used as single agents or in combination, were
then injected into tumor-bearing mice. To differentiate the
function of Verticillin A in TRAIL sensitization from its direct
tumor growth-inhibitory activity, a low dose (0.125 mg/kg body
weight) of Verticillin A was used. At this low dose, Verticillin A
did not exhibit signiﬁcant tumor suppression activity (Fig. 3).
As expected, SW620 tumors were resistant to TRAIL (Fig. 3;
ref. 26). However, combined treatment with low dose of
Verticillin A and TRAIL signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor cell
xenograft growth (Fig. 3). Taken together, our data suggest

Figure 3. Verticillin A overcomes TRAIL resistance in vivo. SW620 cells

every 2 days for 14 days. Tumor growth was measured over time.

that Verticillin A is an effective sensitizer in TRAIL-mediated
suppression of metastatic colon carcinoma in vivo.
Verticillin A induces cell-cycle arrest
In the literature, enhanced cell-cycle arrest has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of
natural compounds combined with therapeutic agents on
tumor cell apoptosis (27). To determine whether Verticillin
A alters cell-cycle progression, we treated HepG2 and SW620
cells with Verticillin A and analyzed cell cycle in the treated
cells. Verticillin A altered cell-cycle progression in SW620 cells
(Fig. 4A) but not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). It is apparent that
Verticillin A induced a dramatic arrest at the G2 phase of the
cell cycle in SW620 cells (Fig. 4C).
Verticillin A upregulates BNIP3 expression
The above observation that Verticillin A induces cell-cycle
arrest in SW620 cells, but not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4), suggests
that enhanced cell-cycle arrest is unlikely the sole mechanism
of Verticillin A function. Our data also indicate that Verticillin
A does not signiﬁcantly alter TRAIL or Fas receptor expression
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Because Verticillin A induced tumor
cell apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 2), we analyzed the protein levels of
genes with known functions in the mitochondrion-dependent
apoptosis pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, Verticillin A did not
alter the expression level of those antiapoptotic genes examined in SW620 cells. However, among the proapoptotic protein
examined, Verticillin A increased BNIP3 protein levels in a
dose-dependent manner in SW620 cells (Fig. 5B). Analysis of
BNIP3 protein level revealed that Verticillin A also increased
BNIP3 protein level in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C).
We next silenced Verticillin A–induced BNIP3 in both
HepG2 and SW620 cells and analyzed the effects of loss of
BNIP3 on Verticillin A–enhanced apoptosis. Verticillin A upregulated BNIP3 expression and BNIP3 siRNA blocked Verticillin
A–induced BNIP3 expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6A). Silencing
BNIP3 signiﬁcantly decreased Verticillin A–induced apoptosis

BNIP3 mRNA level by semiquantitative (top) and real-time (right) RT-PCR. D, the transfected cells were recultured in the presence of Verticillin A (10 nmol/L)
with or without TRAIL protein (10 ng/mL) for another 24 hours and stained with PI and Annexin V. Cell death was analyzed and quantiﬁed (as in B; right).
Columns, mean; bars, SD.   , P < 0.01.

Verticillin A upregulates BNIP3 expression potentially
through inducing DNA demethylation
Analysis of the human BNIP3 promoter region revealed that
the BNIP3 promoter is GC rich and contains CpG islands (Fig.
7A). We then used MS-PCR to analyze the methylation status of
the BNIP3 in 3 human colon carcinoma cell lines, HepG2 cells,
and tumor tissues dissected from 5 parafﬁn-embedded human
colorectal carcinoma specimens (4 liver metastases and 1
primary adenocarcinoma). BNIP3 promoter is methylated in
all the cell lines and the tumor specimens examined (Fig. 7B).
The above observations suggest that Verticillin A might
activate BNIP3 expression in human cancer cells through
inhibiting DNA methylation. To determine whether Verticillin
A–inhibited DNA methylation is a general phenomenon, we
tested the effects of Verticillin A on the expression of a panel of
4 genes known to be regulated by DNA methylation (23, 28, 29).
As expected, azacytidine treatment increased the expression
level of BNIP3 and these 4 genes (Fig. 7C). At the same time,
Verticillin A treatment also increased the expression of BNIP3

www.aacrjournals.org

and these 4 genes. Thus, our data suggest that Verticillin A
might function at least partially through upregulating BNIP3 in
a DNA demethylation–dependent manner.

Discussion
Verticillin A is a compound of the epidithiodioxopiprazine
structural class. In a screening for antitumor cytotoxic natural
compounds, we puriﬁed a compound from Verticilliuminfected mushrooms Amanita ﬂavorubescens Alk and identiﬁed
this compound as Verticillin A. Neither uninfected Amanita
ﬂavorubescens Alk nor the pathogen fungus Verticillium contains Verticillin A, suggesting that Verticillin A is synthesized
during the host and pathogen interaction. Here, we showed
that Verticillin A is an effective tumor suppressor that induces
tumor cell apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations. More
importantly, Verticillin A exhibited potent activity as an apoptosis sensitizer that effectively overcame metastatic human
colon carcinoma cell resistance to TRAIL-, Fas-, and other

cytotoxic agent–induced apoptosis in vitro at a concentration
as low as 10 nmol/L. Furthermore, Verticillin A also overcame
human colon carcinoma xenograft resistance to TRAIL therapy
in vivo. Therefore, Verticillin A is a potent apoptosis sensitizer.
TRAIL is considered a selective anticancer drug (2, 30),
and TRAIL-based cancer therapy is currently in phase I and
II clinical trials. However, most cancer cells, especially
cancer cells in advanced stages, are resistant to TRAIL
(12). Overcoming TRAIL resistance is thereby of urgent
signiﬁcance (3). Current approaches to overcome TRAIL
resistance largely focus on combination treatment with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents (4, 10, 16, 17, 31–
34). Combinations of TRAIL receptor mAb with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are currently tested in clinical
trials against metastatic human colorectal cancer. However,
although proven effective, toxicity of these chemotherapeutic agents may offset the advantage of tumor selectivity and
low toxicity of TRAIL therapy. Natural compounds have
been shown to possess TRAIL sensitization activity (35–
39). One example of such a compound is sulforaphane, a
dietary isothiocyanate found in broccoli and cauliﬂower
(35–37). Here, we identiﬁed Verticillin A from fungusinfected mushrooms as another natural compound that

6814

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

possesses biological activity as a TRAIL sensitizer. Compared with sulforaphane, which sensitizes tumor cells to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in micromolar concentrations
(35–37), Verticillin A sensitizes multiple types of tumor cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations,
suggesting that Verticillin is potentially a more potent
TRAIL sensitizer that warrants clinical testing for its effectiveness in enhancing the efﬁcacy of TRAIL therapy in
human cancer patients.
Structurally related Verticillin compounds have been
shown to possess biological activities to inhibit induction
of several oncogenes (40, 41). 11,11'-Dideoxy-verticillin, a
natural compound isolated from herb Shiraia bambusicola,
has also been shown to inhibit epidermal growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinase activity and to suppress tumor
growth (40). Although, Verticillin A shares some structural
similarity with 11,11'-dideoxy-verticillin, Verticillin A
apparently possesses very different biological activity. We
showed here that Verticillin A induces the expression of
BNIP3 in both hepatoma and colon carcinoma cells. We
also showed that this Verticillin A–elicited increase in
BNIP3 expression either directly induces apoptosis in
HepG2 cells or sensitizes the metastatic colon carcinoma
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). BNIP3 is a
proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (42) that mediates
tumor cell apoptosis (43–47). However, it has also been
reported that BNIP3 upregulation is not associated with
arsenic trioxide–mediated TRAIL sensitization in human
glioma (48), suggesting that the function of BNIP3 in
apoptosis might be tumor type or cellular context dependent. Nevertheless, we showed here that Verticillin A
upregulates BNIP3 in both human hepatoma and colon
carcinoma cells, and BNIP3 upregulation is at least partially responsible for the increased apoptosis in hepatoma
and colon carcinoma cells. It should be pointed out that
although Verticillin A induces BNIP3 in both colon carcinoma and hepatoma cells, Verticillin A sensitized the
human colon carcinoma to TRAIL-induced apoptosis at
a low dose (10 nmol/L). In contrast, lower dose (10 nmol/L)
of Verticillin A did not overcome HepG2 cell resistance to
TRAIL-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S6). This
difference might be due, at least in part, to the different
cell-cycle arrest induction in these 2 types of tumors (Fig.
4). However, whether higher doses of Verticillin A sensitize
hepatoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis remains to be
determined.
BNIP3 expression has been shown to be regulated by DNA
methylation in tumor cells (49). The promoter region of the
human BNIP3 gene contains CpG islands (Fig. 7) and inhibition of DNA methylation increases BNIP3 expression in the
human colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 7C). We showed here that
the BNIP3 promoter is methylated in both human hepatoma
and colon carcinoma cells, as well as in human colon
carcinoma specimens (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, inhibition of
DNA methylation with azacytidine increased BNIP3 expression in both human hepatoma and colon carcinoma cells
(Fig. 7C). Thus, our data suggest that Verticillin A increases
BNIP3 expression possibly by inhibiting DNA methylation or

inducing DNA demethylation. However, how Verticillin A
alters DNA methylation to mediate BNIP3 expression
remains to be determined.
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed the natural compound
Verticillin A as a potent cytotoxic agent that has the potential
to be developed as a low toxicity anticancer drug. More
signiﬁcantly, we showed that Verticillin A is also a potent
apoptosis sensitizer that has great potential to be developed as
an effective, yet potentially less toxic, adjuvant agent to overcome drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy against metastatic human colorectal cancer.
