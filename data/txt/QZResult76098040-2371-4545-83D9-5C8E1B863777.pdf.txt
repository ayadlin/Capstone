Abstract
Many oncogenic signals originate from abnormal protein-protein interactions
that are potential targets for small molecule inhibitors. However, the therapeutic
disruption of these interactions has proved elusive. We report here that the naturallyoccurring triterpenoid celastrol is an inhibitor of the c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein,
which is over-expressed in many human cancers. Most Myc inhibitors prevent the
association between Myc and its obligate heterodimerization partner Max via their
respective bHLH-ZIP domains. In contrast, we show that celastrol binds to and alters
the quaternary structure of the pre-formed dimer and abrogates its DNA binding.
Celastrol contains a reactive quinone methide group that promiscuously forms
Michael adducts with numerous target proteins and other free sulfhydryl-containing
molecules. Interestingly, triterpenoid derivatives lacking the quinone methide showed
enhanced specificity and potency against Myc. As with other Myc inhibitors, these
analogs rapidly reduced the abundance of Myc protein and provoked a global energy
crisis marked by ATP depletion, neutral lipid accumulation, AMP-activated protein
kinase activation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. They also inhibited the proliferation
of numerous established human cancer cell lines as well as primary myeloma explants
that were otherwise resistant to JQ1, a potent indirect Myc inhibitor. N-Myc amplified
neuroblastoma cells showed similar responses and, in additional, underwent neuronal
differentiation. These studies indicate that certain pharmacologically undesirable
properties of celastrol such as Michael adduct formation can be eliminated while
increasing selectivity and potency toward Myc and N-Myc. This, together with their
low in vivo toxicity, provides a strong rationale for pursuing the development of
additional Myc-specific triterpenoid derivatives.

INTRODUCTION

molecules that stabilize Max homodimers [36], it seems
likely that most if not all other “direct” Myc inhibitors
operate through one of these mechanisms [9, 12].
In vivo, direct Myc inhibitors demonstrate short
half-lives, rapid metabolism and/or efflux from target
cells and inefficient tumor penetration [30, 37, 38].
However, at least one direct Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4 [28],
has demonstrated efficacy in vivo [26, 27]. In one case
10058-F4, which also binds to the bHLH-ZIP domain of
the close Myc relative N-Myc [39], prolonged survival
in an animal model of N-Myc-driven neuroblastoma
[26]. In another case, nano-particle-mediated delivery
of a 10058-F4 pro-drug increased the survival of mice
bearing highly metastatic multiple myeloma xenografts
[27]. These findings, together with recent improvements
in the stability and cellular uptake of some of the original
compounds [12, 29, 30] have provided encouragement
that more tractable Myc (and N-Myc) inhibitors can be
identified.
Given these considerations, we employed a yeast
2-hybrid-based approach to query a natural product
library so as to identify more pharmaceutically amenable
compounds [28]. This assay registered the triterpenoid
celastrol as a moderately effective Myc inhibitor. Although
celastrol and several related molecules inhibit a variety of
tumor types both in vitro and in vivo [40-47], they often
contain a highly reactive quinone methide moiety that
promiscuously forms Michael adducts with free sulfhydryl
groups [44, 48-50]. Not unexpectedly, numerous potential
targets for celastrol have been identified and some,
such as Hsp90, Cdc37, IKKB, and annexin II, are quite
avid Michael adduct participants [48, 51, 52]. In fact, a
previous mass spectroscopy-based survey showed that
approximately 9% and 3% of proteins comprising the
cellular and mitochondrial proteomes, respectively,
are affected by celastrol [53]. Although many of these
changes are likely secondary in nature and not attributable
to Michael adduct formation per se, the large number of
changes greatly diminishes the appeal of celastrol and
related quinone methide-containing triterpenoids as viable
chemotherapeutic agents.
Celastrol belongs to the family of triterpenoids that
share a core structure of five fused carbocyclic rings. In
contrast, many triterpenoids, including betulinic acid,
oleanoic acid and ursolic acid lack the quinone methide
moiety and instead possess a fully saturated core [41].
We show here that some triterpenoids lacking a quinone
methide retain Myc inhibitory activity and in some cases
are significantly better Myc inhibitors than celastrol itself.
We further demonstrate their efficacy against several
tumor types, particularly myelomas. Celastrol-inspired
triterpenoids thus represent a new and intriguing class
of agents that merits further consideration as potentially
novel and more specific Myc inhibitors.

The pharmacologic deployment of small molecule
inhibitors of transcription factors (TFs) is a major
therapeutic goal for many diseases [1-4], particularly in
cancer where aberrant TF expression is often a primary
driver [5-8]. Although numerous strategies have been
tested in pursuit of this objective, the most direct has been
to identify chemical compounds that disrupt or prevent the
TF’s association with an obligate partner that is necessary
for DNA binding and/or subsequent downstream
oncogenic signaling [1-3, 8-12]. Unfortunately, the
interacting surfaces of TFs and their partners are often
quite large and devoid of topographic features that permit
the easy design of specific and/or potent inhibitors [1, 9,
12, 13]. The interacting protein surfaces also frequently
possess high free energies of association and/or exist in
a state of intrinsic disorder (ID) prior to assembly. Small
molecules may therefore be unable to disrupt pre-formed
stable complexes and ID regions may lack structurally
defined or stable binding sites [14-16]. Recently, however,
new approaches have generated a number of promising
candidate inhibitors that are addressing and gradually
overcoming some of these barriers.
A therapeutically appealing oncogenic TF is c-Myc
(Myc), which is frequently deregulated in transformed
cells and is invariably required to maintain their high rates
of proliferation, metabolism and ATP synthesis [17-21].
The inhibition of Myc promotes the regression of Mycdriven tumors as well as those not previously appreciated
to be Myc-dependent [22-25]. Moreover, although Myc
is also expressed by normal proliferating cells, its global
inhibition in the whole animal is remarkably well-tolerated
and associated with mild and reversible side-effects [22,
26, 27]. The potential utility of Myc inhibitors in a vast
range of tumors, coupled with this low toxicity profile,
provides further reason to continue the search for novel
compounds.
We and others have identified small molecules that
interfere with the interaction between and subsequent
DNA binding by Myc and its obligate heterodimerization
partner Max, which associate via homologous basic-helixloop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) domains [9, 12, 2832]. Our characterization of some of these Myc inhibitors,
most notably 10058-F4 and 10074-G5 and their analogs
[28-30], has revealed that they interact specifically with
and locally distort, short ID segments of contiguous amino
acids within the bHLH-ZIP domain of Myc thus blocking
its ability to dimerize with Max and bind DNA [33-35].
More recently, we showed that another small molecule
termed JKY-2-169, deliberately engineered to interact with
Myc in its Max-associated, α-helical conformation, causes
a loss of DNA binding by distorting the heterodimer
without dissociating it [31]. With the exception of small

attributed to Michael adduct formation (Figure 1B). As
seen in Figure 1C, celastrol prevented DNA binding by
Myc-Max(S) heterodimers [56] with IC50s comparable to
or lower than those for Myc inhibitors such as 10058-F4
and 10074-G5[28] (Figure 1D). Celastrol was significantly
less effective against Max(L) homodimers despite their
weaker association and DNA binding [57] (Figure 1B
and C). Thus, celastrol displays potency and specificity
profiles comparable to those of other direct Myc inhibitors
[12, 28-31, 58].

Identification of celastrol as a Myc inhibitor
We used a yeast 2-hybrid assay to screen a library
of naturally-occurring compounds for those that interfered
with the Myc-Max-DNA interaction [28]. The most active
compound identified was celastrol, a quinone methide
triterpenoid originally isolated from a member of the
Celastraceae family of creeping plants and known to
practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine as the “Thunder
of God” vine (Figure 1A) [44, 51, 52]. To confirm
celastrol’s effect on DNA binding by Myc, we employed
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using
recombinant Myc and Max proteins [54, 55]. Notably,
both proteins lacked free cysteines, thereby eliminating
the possibility that any effects on DNA binding could be

Improved activity of select celastrol-inspired
compounds lacking quinone methide moieties
Certain ester and amide derivatives of celastrol,
including two termed CA16 and CA19, inhibit melanoma
xenografts in vivo [41]. However, like celastrol, they
contain a quinone methide moiety. On the other hand the

methide moiety. B. Formation of a typical Michael adduct with cysteine as an example (depicted in blue) is shown. Note that nucleophilic
attack by free sulfhydryl-containing molecules occurs at position 6 of the B ring. C. Typical EMSA results in response to varying
concentrations of celastrol. Recombinant Myc bHLH-ZIP domain (residues 353-437), and full-length Max(S) and Max(L) were used for
EMSAs along with a HEX-tagged, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a Myc binding E-box element (CACGTG) [30, 31]. Max(S)
is the 151 residue isoform that homodimerizes efficiently but only binds DNA as a heterodimer in association with Myc [29, 30, 54, 55, 85].
The 160 residue isoform, termed Max(L), that does bind DNA as a homodimer and that closely mimics the Myc-Max(S) association was
used as a control [54, 55]. D. Graphical representation of EMSA results from triplicate assays performed as described in C. IC50 values were
defined as the concentration of celastrol required to interfere with half the binding of Myc-Max(S) heterodimers or Max(L) homodimers.

structurally related triterpenoids betulinic, oleanoic and
ursolic acids contain a saturated carbocyclic core structure.
We therefore constructed a small library of analogs
designed around these three acid scaffolds (Supplementary
Figure 1) and tested them for their effects on DNA binding
by Myc-Max(S) heterodimers. We also tested CA16 and
CA19, as well as dihydrocelastrol-a reduced variant of
celastrol-that contains an enone moiety.
Screening at high concentrations (100 µM) in
the EMSA assay identified 7 active compounds (>50%
inhibition-not shown). This, as well as greater specificity
for Myc-Max(S) than for Max(L) was confirmed in
subsequent concentration-response profiling with the
most members (Supplementary Figure 2). Surprisingly, 3

compounds lacking quinone methides (SBI-0069272, SBI0640599 and SBI-0640601-Supplementary Figure 1) were
4-6-fold more potent than celastrol (IC50s=10-15 µM)
while continuing to demonstrate good specificity. A fourth
analog, SBI-0061739, was somewhat less specific, with
a ~2-fold preference for Myc-Max(S) heterodimers over
Max(L) homodimers. Together, we refer to these as “SBI
compounds”. The quinone methide moiety is therefore
not only dispensable for the anti-Myc activity but in some
cases is actually inhibitory.
To confirm on-target binding, we employed a surface
plasmon resonance (SPR)-based approach [59] in which
an E-box-containing oligonucleotide is tethered to the
sensor chip of the SPR instrument and is followed by the

Figure 2: SPR analysis. SBI-061739 abrogates DNA binding equally well when added prior to or following the formation of Myc-

Max(S) heterodimers. A. A biotin-tagged E-box-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide was attached to a streptavadin-impregnated
biosensor chip so as to achieve a response of 700-800 units as previously described [31, 59]. The reading was then re-set to 0. Purified
recombinant Myc (20 nM) was allowed to interact with the indicated concentrations of 10074-G5, which binds to the Myc monomer [33,
34]. An equimolar amount of Max(S) was then added. Note the dose-dependent effect of 10058-F4 on Myc-Max(S) heterodimerization. B.
The experiment described in A was repeated except that 10058-F4 was added to preformed Myc-Max(S) heterodimers. C., D. The same
experiments described in A and B were performed except that JKY-2-169 was added to the indicated final concentrations. E., F. The same
experiments performed with the indicated amounts of SBI-0061739. Neither the injection of individual Myc or Max(S) proteins nor any of
the tested Myc inhibitors altered the response of the immobilized oligonucleotide (not shown).

addition of Myc and Max(S) in the presence of increasing
amounts of inhibitor. Because compounds such as 10058F4 and 10074-G5 prevent Myc-Max(S) heterodimerization
by distorting Myc’s bHLH-ZIP domain, they are most
effective when added prior to heterodimerization (Figure
2A) [33, 34]. In contrast, their addition to pre-formed
Myc-Max(S) heterodimers is much less effective due to
the high free energy of association of the complex (Figure
2B) [57]. A much different pattern was observed with
the α-helical mimetic JKY-2-169, which interferes with
Myc-Max(S) DNA binding by distorting the heterodimer’s
conformation and is thus independent on the timing of its

addition (Figure 2C and 2D) [31]. SBI-061739 was also
equally effective irrespective of its addition relative to
Myc-Max(S) heterodimerization thus suggesting that its
mechanism of action closely mimics that of JKY-2-169
(Figure 2E and 2F). Similar but somewhat less pronounced
effects were observed with celastrol (not shown).

Given that our SPR-based assessment showed that
SBI-061739 altered Myc-Max(S) binding to DNA in
a manner similar to that seen with JKY-2-169 (Figure
2), we explored further how celastrol itself affected the
structure of Myc-Max(S). For this, we employed this
same 15N-HSQC spectroscopy-based strategy [31], which
allows the observation of interactions between small
molecules and a protein of interest over a broad range of
affinities. Even without residue-specific assignment, the
technique provides insight into changes in secondary or
overall structural arrangements and potentially allows the
elucidation of affinities.
To study how celastrol interacts with Myc and
Max(S), 15N- or 14N-labeled recombinant proteins, purified

as described for Figure 1, were used. At concentrations up
to 100-125 µM, celastrol failed to provoke any observable
chemical shift perturbations in Myc or Max(S), thereby
indicating that it binds neither of the individual proteins
(Figure 3A and 3B). We next formed the heterodimer
by adding equimolar amounts of unlabeled Max(S) to
15
N-Myc and observed the expected substantial change in
the HSQC spectrum of 15N-Myc, indicative of increased
α-helical content in the latter protein and reflecting its
efficient heterodimerization (Figure 3C) [31, 57, 60].
The addition of celastrol to this heterodimer mediated
additional, large chemical shift perturbations, indicating
that the heterodimer is needed to provide a suitable
binding site and that, following celastrol’s addition, the

final configuration attained is unlike that of either protein
component alone (Figure 3D). These changes cannot
be explained by non-specific effects such as protein
aggregation as the line width of the resonances was
unaffected over the entire celastrol concentration range
(not shown). Similar studies performed with SBI-0640601
yielded equivalent spectral perturbations (not shown).
Collectively, these data suggested that celastrol and SBI
analogs, like JKY-2-169 [31], inhibits DNA binding by
altering the Myc-Max(S) heterodimer’s structure without
causing its dissociation.

In addition to direct Myc inhibitors such as 10058F4, 10074-G5 and JKY-2-169, “indirect” Myc inhibitors
have also been described [12]. These include JQ1, which
inhibits the Myc-associated chromatin remodeling
enzyme Brd4 and the synthetic lethal compound
dihydroartemisinin, which activates the Ser/Thr kinase
GSK3β that in turn phosphorylates and de-stabilizes

ratio of fluorescence intensities between analog-treated cells (red curves) and vehicle-treated cells (green curves) in three independent

agents for 4-5 days. Cells were then immuno-stained to detect the expression of CD14 (myeloid) and CD15 (monocyte/macrophage) cell
surface antigens [21]. DMSO- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated cells served as controls for “pure” myeloid and
monocyte/macrophage differentiation, respectively [67, 68]. Cell surface fluorescence was quantified by two-color flow cytometry [21].

Myc [12, 61]. Regardless of their class or structure, all
these inhibitors promote cell cycle arrest, loss of Myc
expression and the inhibition of Myc-regulated genes
[21]. This is associated with a rapid depletion of cellular
ATP stores that likely results from reduced glycolysis
and oxidative phosphorylation, both of which are Mycdependent [20, 62]. This leads to the up-regulation of
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which works
to restore ATP levels [63, 64]. Normally, this occurs by
AMPK’s suppression of proliferation and other energyconsuming processes until it can restore glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation and replenish ATP supplies [63,
64]. In Myc’s absence, however, these processes remain
suppressed, thus leading to AMPK’s chronic activation
and the persistence of an ATP-depleted state [20, 62].
Recognizing their unmet energy demands, Myc-deficient
cells respond by increasing fatty acid uptake and oxidation
(FAO) and store the excess fatty acids as neutral lipid
[26, 62]. In certain leukemia cells, Myc inhibitors also
induce myeloid differentiation [21, 65, 66], which can be
mimicked by depleting ATP without affecting Myc levels
[21].
All the above processes were faithfully recapitulated
in HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in which
SBI analogs induced a concentration-dependent cell
cycle arrest that correlated with a decline in intracellular
Myc protein levels (Figure 4A and 4B). Thus, within 4
hr of their addition, SBI analogs selectively inhibited the
expression of a Myc-responsive promoter relative to that
of an AP-1-responsive promoter whereas celastrol itself
was somewhat more selective for the latter (Figure 4C and
4D). These results are further consistent with our finding
that the absence of an active quinone methide confers
greater Myc specificity to the resultant compounds.
Additional findings included a marked depletion of ATP
and the phosphorylation-dependent activation of AMPK
(Figure 5A and 5C). Staining with the neutral lipid-specific
dye BODIPY-493/503 was also enhanced (Figure 5C) and
was consistent with prior observations in other cell types
following Myc or N-Myc inhibition [26, 62]. Finally,
cells up-regulated the myeloid cell surface antigen CD15
at levels comparable to those seen in response to other
Myc inhibitors or the classical myeloid differentiating
agent DMSO (Figure 5D) [67]. In contrast, treatment with
the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) induced a more myelo-monocytic differentiation as
evidenced by the concurrent expression of the CD14 cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

surface antigen [68]. Together with the results displayed
in Figure 4, these findings show that, like other Myc
inhibitors, SBI analogs promote cell cycle arrest, destabilize Myc protein, deplete cellular ATP stores and
activate AMPK. Their induction of myeloid maturation
is also consistent with Myc’s known role in suppressing
differentiation [69-72].

SBI compounds inhibit the proliferation of
multiple cancer types
Celastrol and some related triterpenoids inhibit
numerous cancer types, both in vitro and in vivo [4146]. We therefore tested the above SBI compounds for in
vitro activity against several cancer types. Initially, these
included HL60 and Burkitt lymphoma cells because they
express extremely high levels of Myc and respond to Myc
inhibitors by undergoing proliferative arrest and apoptosis
[73] (Figures 4 and 5). As seen in Table 1, celastrol and
the SBI analogs tested inhibited the proliferation of both
cell types. Unsurprisingly, celastrol was the most potent
compound, despite being the least effective Myc inhibitor
(Figure 1C).
We next examined multiple myeloma (MM) cell
lines given that many are associated with de-regulated
Myc expression and are susceptible to some Myc
inhibitors [17, 27, 74-76]. 10058-F4 and JQ1, chosen as
representative members of the direct and indirect classes
of inhibitors, respectively [12], inhibited nearly all cell
lines tested, with JQ1 being more effective in all cases by
a factor of nearly 90 (mean IC50: 0.25 µM vs. 21.8 µM)
(Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 3). SBI analogs
showed intermediate activities ranging from 0.26-67.3
µM with SBI-0061739 being the most potent. Indeed,
8 of 9 cells lines showed IC50 values of <1 µM for this
compound. Interestingly, the most resistant myeloma line
tested, U266, is the only one that expresses L-Myc instead
of Myc [76]. Disregarding this cell line, the mean IC50
for JQ1 (0.25 µM) was <2-fold lower than that for SBI0061739 (0.42 µM).
With only a single exception, primary myeloma
cells were resistant to JQ1 whereas the majority were
sensitive to 10058-F4 in a concentration range similar
to that observed for established myeloma cell lines
(Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 4). Notably, most
myelomas were even more sensitive to SBI compounds
32387

(SBI-0069272, SBI-0640601 and SBI-0061739) than to
10058-F4 and JQ1.
Given the apparent superiority of SBI-0061739
against myelomas, we conducted a broad screen with this
compound against the National Cancer Institute NCI-60
cell line collection. Overall, 17 cell lines (28%) were
highly sensitive to SBI-0061739, with IC50 values <2
µM (Supplementary Figure 4). Although the numbers of
cell lines for any specific cancer were relatively small,
particularly sensitive types included leukemias (4/6 lines),

non-small cell lung cancer (3/9 lines) and breast cancer
(3/7 lines). Ovarian and renal cancers appeared the most
resistant, with all 6 lines from the first group and 7 of 8
cell lines from the second group showing IC50 values >2
µM. Thus, myelomas are particularly sensitive to SBI
compounds and specifically to SBI-0061739.
Neuroblastoma cells respond to previouslydescribed Myc inhibitors by down-regulating N-Myc,

celastrol and SBI analogs SBI-0640599 and SBI-0069272
on N-Myc-amplified SK-N-BE(2) human neuroblastoma
cells were similar. As seen in Figure 7A, N-Myc protein
declined within 24 hr of adding 10058-F4, celastrol or
SBI compounds. The cells also accumulated neutral lipid
(Figure 7B) and eventually differentiated as evidenced
by an increase in the number and length of neurite
protrusions, which were further enhanced by nerve growth
factor (Figure 7C). Celastrol and certain SBI compounds

promiscuity [45, 46, 48, 50, 52, 53, 65, 77, 78]. Therefore
the discovery of compounds that replicate the therapeutic
benefits of celastrol, while minimizing its non-specific
properties, would represent a key advancement.
By synthesizing and testing specific triterpenoid
derivatives, we found certain celastrol-inspired compounds
lacking the quinone methide moiety to be significantly
better than celastrol at disrupting Myc-Max(S) DNA
binding. Further evidence that the quinone methide
group’s negative effect on DNA binding was unrelated to
any aspect of Michael adduct formation was the fact that
none of the recombinant Myc or Max proteins used in the
current work contained cysteine residues. Thus, the more
efficient interaction of SBI compounds with Myc-Max(S)
heterodimers argues that the quinone methide group is not
only dispensable for the anti-Myc effect but is actually
detrimental. The future design of triterpenoids lacking

DISCUSSION
While celastrol and several of its analogs possess
significant anti-neoplastic effects in vitro and in vivo
[40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 52, 53, 65, 77, 78], their clinical
implementation has been hampered by their chemical

Myc inhibitors may find application in the treatment of
neuroblastoma where N-Myc over-expression is highly
correlated with disease stage and survival [84].
Celastrol and some of its quinone methidecontaining analogs are active against a range of tumors
and are surprisingly well-tolerated in vivo [40, 41, 43,
45-47, 70, 78]. These favorable pharmacologic profiles
suggested that quinone methide-lacking analogs with
reduced target promiscuity might be even better tolerated
but also less potent due to their more focused biological
effects. Indeed, our preliminary studies support this
by showing that the most potent SBI analogs tested in
vivo are tolerated at i.v. doses as high as 20-40 mg/kg/
day (not shown). As predicted however, they are less
potent than other celastrol analogs with intact quinone
methide moieties such as CA19 [41] and we have yet to
demonstrate sustained effects against murine models of
human myeloma xenografts (not shown). Future attempts
to optimize Myc-targeted triterpenoids therapeutically may
require not only improving potency against Myc itself but
also perhaps on restoring at least partial off target activity.

this group will likely address how to further increase both
potency and specificity.
The absence of a quinone methide moiety in all four
of the most potent SBI compounds, while significantly
increasing their Myc specificity, concurrently decreased
their anti-proliferative efficacy against cancer cell lines
(Table 1, Figure 6 and unpublished data). This was not
unexpected given that a number of celastrol’s most
prominent targets participate in Michael adduct formation
[45, 46, 48, 50, 52, 53, 65, 77]. For example, the potent
inhibitory effect against NF-kB, is at least partly mediated
by celastrol’s adduct formation with the regulatory protein
IKKB [49]. Celastrol’s potent inhibition of Hsp90 is also
likely indirect and mediated by the formation of a disulfide
linkage with the Hsp90 partner p37 [79]. The observation
that free thiols block many of celastrol’s biological effects
[50] suggests that they are mediated by numerous other
promiscuous disulfide bond-forming reactions. These
results imply that eliminating the quinone methide
function of celastrol should reduce its overall potency by
virtue of minimizing its promiscuous interactions while
improving its inhibition of Myc.
As was true for other Myc inhibitors, cell lines
showed different susceptibilities to SBI analogs (Figure
6 and Supplementary Figure 4). This was perhaps best
illustrated with myelomas. Discounting the previously
discussed U266 line, which neither expresses Myc nor
is sensitive to 10058-F4 [76], we observed as much as
3-4-fold differential susceptibilities in response to 10058F4, 20-fold differences in response to the bromodomain
inhibitor JQ1 and up to 6-fold differences in response
to SBI compounds. JQ1 was usually the most potent
compound, which is consistent with its being a highly
effective, albeit indirect, Myc inhibitor [80-83].
Several major differences were noted between the
above cell lines and primary myeloma explants however.
First, JQ1, was virtually without effect against primary
myelomas, even at concentrations exceeding 10-20 µM
(Figure 6B). Second, primary explants sensitive to 10058F4, were usually sensitive to at least one, if not all, of the
tested SBI compounds. Conversely, primary myelomas
resistant to 10058-F4 also tended to be resistant to SBI
compounds. This suggests that, at least in the examples
presented here, the relative sensitivity of a primary
myeloma is determined more by intrinsic properties of the
tumor rather than by the nature of the Myc inhibitor. While
finding reasonable correlations between Myc expression
and sensitivity to 10058-F4, we were unable to show these
in primary myelomas. It will clearly be important in future
work to determine the basis for these observed differential
therapeutic susceptibilities.
It was not surprising that the effects of celastrol and
SBI compounds on neuroblastoma cells were similar to
those seen with 10058-F4 (Figure 7). This is in keeping
with the close functional relationship between Myc and
N-Myc [26, 39] and supports the idea that, as a group,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Natural product library screening
A yeast two hybrid system that allows the Myc-Max
interaction to be quantified was screened as described
previously [28] with a 720 member collection of natural
products that includes complex oxygen heterocycles,
sesquiterpenes, diterpenes alkaloids, sterols, pentacyclic
triterpenes, and other compounds (Discovery Systems,
Inc. Gaylordsville, CT). All compounds were supplied as
10 mM stocks in DMSO and were screened in duplicate
wells at 10 µM concentrations. Compounds registering as
“hits” were screened again at varying concentrations for
verification before being advanced for further study.

Chemical synthesis of triterpenoids
Celastrol, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic
acid were purchased from commercial sources and
derivatized according to previously reported procedures
[44, 75]. Details for the synthesis of the SBI analogues,
including synthetic schemes, experimental procedures
and spectral characterization data are available in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. CA 16 and CA 19
were synthesized according to published procedures [41,
78].

Purification of recombinant Myc and Max
proteins and EMSA assays

Avance 600 MHz spectrometer (Billerica, MA). A
standard 1H/15N fast HSQC pulse sequence was used
with the Max/Myc proteins at 298K. The chemical shifts
were referenced to the 1H2O signal at 4.87 ppm. Data
were processed using NMRPipe (http://spin. niddk.nih.
gov/NMRPipe/). Spectra were analyzed using a modified
version of Sparky (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/
manual/ files.html).

The 83 residue His6-tagged Myc bHLH-ZIP domain
(amino acids 354-437), and full-length His6-tagged Max(S)
and His6-tagged Max(L) were expressed and purified as
previously described [30, 85]. 20 nmol each of Myc and
Max(S) or 40 ng of Max(L) were used for EMSA assays
that included 30 nmol of a (HEX)-tagged double-stranded
E-box-containing oligonucleotide (IDT, Coralville, IA,
USA) [30, 85]. Importantly, the Myc protein excluded the
two C-terminal amino acids (Cys438 and Ala439) from the
final sequence, thus eliminating a potential reaction site
for quinone methide-containing triterpenoids.

Cell cycle analyses, flow cytometry, immunoblotting and ATP assays
Cell cycle analyses were performed as previously
described [21, 29, 30]. Briefly, test compounds were added
to logarithmically-growing cells for 24-48 h. Cells were
then washed twice in PBS and stained with propidium
iodide. Cell cycle profiles were generated using a BD
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc.
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed with ModFit
LT 3.3 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME,
USA).
To monitor HL60 differentiation, we quantified the
expression of macrophage/monocyte-specific cell surface
antigen CD14 and myeloid-specific cell surface antigen
CD15 using fluorescently-tagged monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) as previously described [21]. Two-color flow
cytometry was performed on a BD FACSCalibur™ flow
cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Pro software
(BD Biosciences) and Flowing Software 2.5.1 (www.
flowingsoftware.com).
Immunoblotting was performed as previously
described [21, 29, 30]. Antibodies included a mouse mAb
against human Myc (1:500 dilution: Clone 9E10, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA), a mouse mAb
against β−actin (1:10,000 dilution: cat. no.3700S Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA), a mouse mAb
against AMPK (1:1000 dilution: catalog no. 2532, Cell
Signaling Technology) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against AMPK phospho-Thr172 (1:1000 dilution, catalog
no.2535, Cell Signaling Technologies).
For ATP assays, cells were exposed to test
compounds in 12 well plates for 24-18 h and were then
counted and lysed in 96 well plates [20, 21, 62]. ATP
was quantified in quadruplicate with an ATP Lite ATP
detection kit (Perkin-Elmer, Inc. Downers Grove, IL).
Luminescence was adjusted to the input cell number and
expressed as a relative value compared with an untreated
control. Statistical analyses utilized GraphPad Prism 5
Software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA). P values
were determined with Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison
Test.

Cell culture and viability assays
Cell lines were propagated in RPMI medium or
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimal essential medium
(D-MEM), containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
mL penicillin G and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Proliferation
and viability assays, cells were performed in 96 well plates
in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds. Relative
cell numbers and viability were determined 2-4 days later
using MTT or CellTiter Glo (Promega, Inc. Madison, WI)
assays as previously described [29, 30, 76, 86].
Primary myeloma samples were obtained from the
Norwegian Myeloma Biobank after obtaining approval
from the Regional Ethics Committee.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and NMR
spectroscopy studies
SPR experiments were performed as described
previously [59] using a Biacore™ 3000 instrument
and streptavidin-coated biosensor chips (SA-Chip, GE
Healthcare, Inc. Piscataway, NJ). The running buffer used
was HBS-EP (10mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 500 mM NaCl; 3
mM EDTA; 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) [59]. The E-boxcontaining oligonucleotide was attached over a 30 min
period at a rate 10 µL/min and adjusted to achieve binding
levels of ~700-800 RU, which was then reset to 0 prior to
the application of proteins.
The measurement of Myc-Max(S) binding to the
oligonucleotide and its disruption by inhibitors were
performed in HBS-EP buffer at a flow rate of 60 µL/
min to minimize any mass-transport limitation effects.
Protein solutions, containing 20 nM each of Myc and
Max(S), were injected for 300 seconds. Protein-DNA
complexes were dissociated in HBS-EP buffer for 100
seconds. Individually, neither Myc monomer nor any
Myc inhibitors altered the response of the immobilized
oligonucleotide (not shown).
NMR Experiments were performed on a Bruker
