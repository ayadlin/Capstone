The incidence of cancer during pregnancy is increasing given the trend for
women to postpone childbearing. Knowledge of the potential toxicity and teratogenicity of chemotherapy agents is crucial for patient counseling. Platinum derivatives are active against various malignancies that occur more frequently during
pregnancy: melanoma, cervical and ovarian cancers, and lung cancer. The
authors of this article performed a systematic review of reports documenting the

through January 2008. Forty-three pregnancies were described: 36 patients
received cisplatin, 6 patients received carboplatin, and 1 patient received both
drugs. Two fetal malformations occurred after in utero exposure to cisplatin, but
remains speculative. However, either detectable cisplatin levels or platinum-DNA
adducts were observed in neonates who were exposed to platinum derivatives
during the third trimester, providing evidence for a late-onset transplacental
transfer of these drugs. The administration of platinum derivatives, although feasible during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, raises concern regarding the transplacental transfer of these drugs in late pregnancy and has unknown
short- and long-term effects. Cancer 2008;113:3069–74.  2008 American Cancer

ancer is the second leading cause of mortality in women ages
25 to 39 years1 and occurs in approximately 1 of 1000 pregnancies. Given the trend for women to postpone childbearing, this incidence is increasing.2 The most common solid tumors observed
during pregnancy are cervical and breast cancers followed by ovarian cancer and melanoma.3 Most recently, lung cancer was identified as an emerging concern in young women.4 The treatment of
such malignancies requires a multidisciplinary approach to balance
optimal anticancer therapeutics for the mother and fetal well-being.
The main parameters that may influence decision making are the
type of malignancy and its extension, the gestational age, the opinion of the parents on therapeutic abortion, and treatment-associated maternal and fetal morbidity. This latter factor is the least
documented, and to the authors’ knowledge little information is
available on the effects of anticancer chemotherapy during pregnancy, especially on drug delivery to the fetus.
Platinum derivatives are alkylating agents that have clinical activity against various types of solid tumors,5,6 including melanoma and
ovarian, cervical, and lung cancers. Indeed, the optimal therapeutic
management of these cancers during pregnancy may require the use
of platinum derivatives. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive
review of the English literature with the objective of collecting

from the analysis of maternal and fetal toxicity. To
our knowledge, oxaliplatin use during pregnancy has
not been reported to date. Toxicities were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).

Cisplatin and Pregnancy
Thirty-six reports documenting the use of cisplatin
during pregnancy were identified.7-44,51 The characteristics of the 36 patients are summarized in Table 1.
The median age at diagnosis was 30.5 years (range,
18-40 years). Cisplatin was administered as a single
agent in 6 patients (17%) and with other combination chemotherapies were administered in 30
patients (83%). In most patients, chemotherapy was
administered for gynecologic malignancies, including
cervical cancers in 7 patients (19%) and ovarian cancers in 22 patients (61%). Cisplatin was introduced in
the second or third trimesters in all but 2 patients (6%).
The reported toxicities are summarized in Table 2.
Maternal toxicity was described poorly: In 11 reports
(31%), there was no mention of maternal toxicity
assessment. In the 25 remaining reports, the authors
described mild nausea and emesis, hematologic
toxicity, 1 episode of febrile neutropenia,41 and 2
episodes of alopecia.
Another patient developed grade 2 hearing
impairment after 2 cycles of cisplatin chemotherapy,
and cisplatin was replaced by carboplatin for the 2
following cycles.35 One patient with advanced lung
cancer died of pulmonary embolism.26
Teratogenicity and fetal toxicity included 1 episode of polyhydramnios, 2 episodes of oligoamnios,
and 3 episodes of intrauterine growth restriction (the

severity of the latter was not reported). In 1 patient,28
a moderate bilateral ventriculomegaly (15 mm) was
diagnosed on ultrasound examination at 26 weeks
(5 days). In that patient, because the first cycle of
cisplatin was administered at 25 weeks (5 days),
the relation between this malformation and the
administration of cisplatin was questionable. Pretreatment sonographic screenings were normal in 2
patients and were not mentioned in the remaining
patients.
Neonatal examination was unremarkable in most
children. Three neonates (born at 27 weeks, 35
weeks, and 36.5 weeks, respectively) presented with
acute respiratory distress, possibly because of prematurity. Neonatal complete blood cells counts were
reported in 16 neonates, including 12 normal tests
and 4 cases of cytopenia. One episode of grade 3
anemia was reported (20 days after the last cycle of
chemotherapy).40 Assessment of renal function was
mentioned in 3 neonates. One of those neonates
exhibited a reversible grade 1 elevation of serum creatinine (Days 1-8).13 Normal hearing examinations
were mentioned in 6 neonates. One neonate who
was born at 36 weeks had hearing impairment41 after
the administration of aminoglycosides for neonatal
sepsis, which called into question the role of cisplatin in the development of this toxicity. Another neonate had microphtalmos after intrauterine exposure
to the Dartmouth regimen (tamoxifen, dacarbazine,
carmustine, and cisplatin) during the first trimester.12
The neonate who was diagnosed with ventriculomegaly in utero had hydrocephalus at birth. Detectable
cisplatin levels were reported in the blood of 2 neonates (Table 3).28,33

Carboplatin and Pregnancy
The 7 reports documenting the use of carboplatin
during pregnancy35,45-50 are summarized in Tables 1
and 2. The median maternal age was 40 years (range,
30-43 years). The malignancies were ovarian in all
patients (6 carcinomas and 1 dysgerminoma). Carboplatin was introduced during the second trimester (5
patients) and the third trimester (2 patients). Carboplatin was administered as a single agent (3 patients)
or in association with other drugs (paclitaxel in 3
patients and cyclophosphamide in 1 patient). No
grade 3/4 maternal toxicity related to carboplatin
was reported. All patients underwent caesarean section, and the median gestational age at delivery was
35.5 weeks (range, 33-37 weeks). No malformation
was reported, and the neonatal examination was
unremarkable in all cases. However, in 2 neonates,35,50 platinum-DNA adducts were detected
(Table 3). Finally, the offspring appeared to be
healthy at a median follow-up of 13.5 months (range,
9-20 months).

DISCUSSION
We retrospectively reviewed 45 reports documenting
the use of platinum derivatives during pregnancy,
mainly for gynecologic malignancies (80% of
patients). These reports provided important clinical
information; however, to our knowledge, the pharmacokinetics of platinum derivatives during pregnancy
have not been studied to date.

Transplacental Transfer of Cisplatin and Carboplatin
Preclinical data indicate that platinum derivatives are
mutagenic and teratogenic in animals.52,53 Moreover,
the transplacental transfer of cisplatin in rodents
reportedly increased with gestational age.54 In
humans, cisplatin and carboplatin are highly bound
to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin. The
unbound fraction of these drugs may cross the placenta. Clinical data indicate that lower albumin
levels observed during pregnancy decrease cisplatin
protein binding.55 Consequently, high levels of
unbound cisplatin in the blood of mother and fetus
may increase the risk of toxicity in both.55 Maternalfetal transport kinetics of carboplatin were studied
ex vivo on perfused human placental lobules.56 In that
study, the transport of carboplatin from the maternal
circulation to the fetal circulation was limited in the
human placenta at term, even for concentrations of
carboplatin exceeding twice the therapeutic concentrations. However, we discovered contradictory
results in the current review: either detectable levels
of cisplatin or platinum-DNA adducts were identified

in 4 neonates who were exposed in utero to cisplatin
and carboplatin, suggesting a late transplacental
transfer of these drugs (Table 3). It is interesting to
note that these clinical data support the translation
to humans of preclinical data highlighting that the
transplacental transfer of cisplatin increases with
gestational age.54 Therefore, if treatment in late pregnancy is required, then close neonatal surveillance is
suggested.

Maternal Toxicity
Unfortunately, the majority of current reports do not
specify nadir and duration of hematologic toxicity
with consequent empiric recommendations for treatment during pregnancy. Therefore, we may only suggest starting at the standard dose and adjusting the
dose secondarily to hematologic toxicity. The use of
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, if needed, is
feasible during the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy.33 Moreover, 2 episodes of maternal chemotherapy-related toxicities (hearing impairment and
febrile neutropenia) were observed, suggesting that
an increase in cisplatin dosing may not be required
in pregnant patients. The mean gestational age at
delivery was 35 weeks. Delivery was induced in 5
patients, and caesarean section was scheduled in 2
other patients. However, in most reports, neither the
gestational age at delivery nor the reasons for performing caesarean section were discussed. In
patients with advanced cervical cancer, vaginal delivery may be difficult because of the tumor location,
and caesarean section often is chosen electively to
enable the patient to undergo hysterectomy during
the same surgery. In other malignancies, the large
proportion of scheduled caesarean sections suggests
that both obstetricians and oncologists were attempting to minimize fetal exposure.
Teratogenicity, Fetotoxicity, and Neonatal Outcome
In all but 2 patients,10,12 chemotherapy was initiated
during the second or third trimester, after organogenesis was completed. The role of cisplatin in the 2
malformations observed at birth remains highly
speculative: In 1 patient,28 a ventriculomegaly was
diagnosed during the second trimester, 7 days after
the administration of cisplatin; in the other patient,12
the neonate was diagnosed with microphtalmos after
exposure to combination chemotherapy (Dartmouth
regimen) during the first trimester. It is noteworthy
that microphtalmos is an exceptional malformation,
whereas hydrocephalus is observed in up to 2 of
10,000 live births.57
Moreover, 2 episodes of oligoamnios and 1 episode of neonatal serum creatinine elevation were

Platinum Derivatives and Pregnancy/Mir et al

reported, suggesting that cisplatin may be nephrotoxic in the fetus. In addition, given the potential
hearing and hematologic toxicities in the neonate after the administration of platinum derivatives during
the third trimester, we suggest close neonatal monitoring, including complete blood counts, serum creatinine levels, neurologic examinations, and hearing
examinations.
A clear limitation of this review lies in the finding that, in nearly 33% of reports, no maternal toxicity assessments were conducted. Long-term followup of children who are exposed in utero to platinum
derivatives also clearly is warranted to provide better
documentation regarding the safety of these drugs
for the offspring.
In conclusion, this review of the literature suggests the feasibility of using cisplatin and carboplatin
during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
The initial dosing regimen should be administered
according to the nonpregnant standard, and close
neonatal surveillance is warranted. Although teratogenicity and fetal toxicity have been reported, a causative link has not been established. Therefore, further
reports of platinum use during pregnancy that provide more details on maternal and fetal toxicities are
warranted to confirm the safety of these drugs.
Finally, this review suggests that platinum derivatives
may cross the placenta during the last weeks of pregnancy, with potential short- and long-term toxicity
that remains unknown.
