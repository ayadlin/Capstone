ABSTRACT
Several members of the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family are essential
regulators of genome integrity, actively prospected as drug targets for cancer therapy.
Among them, PARP3 is well characterized for its functions in double-strand break
repair and mitotis. Here we report that PARP3 also plays an integral role in TGFβ and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and stem-like cell properties in human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells.
PARP3 expression is higher in breast cancer cells of the mesenchymal phenotype
and correlates with the expression of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin while
being in inverse correlation with the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Furthermore,
PARP3 expression is significantly upregulated during TGFβ-induced EMT in various
human epithelial cells. In line with this observation, PARP3 depletion alters
TGFβ-dependent EMT of mammary epithelial cells by preventing the induction of
the Snail-E-cadherin axis, the dissolution of cell junctions, the acquisition of cell
motility and chemoresistance. PARP3 responds to TGFβ-induced ROS to promote a
TG2-Snail-E-cadherin axis during EMT. Considering the link between EMT and cancer
stem cells, we show that PARP3 promotes stem-like cell properties in mammary
epithelial and breast cancer cells by inducing the expression of the stem cell markers
SOX2 and OCT4, by increasing the proportion of tumor initiating CD44high/CD24low
population and the formation of tumor spheroid bodies, and by promoting stem cell
self-renewal. These findings point to a novel role of PARP3 in the control of TGFβinduced EMT and acquisition of stem-like cell features and further motivate efforts
to identify PARP3 specific inhibitors.

gain of mesenchymal properties, increased motility and the
acquisition of chemoresistance in tumor cells [2]. There is
also clear evidence that EMT confers cancer stem-like cell
properties [3–5]. At the molecular level, EMT is mediated
by the activation of EMT transcription factors such as
Snail (encoded by SNAI1 gene), the loss of cell junctions
components such as E-cadherin (encoded by CDH1)

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a transdifferentiation programme that is important for
organogenesis in the developing embryo, tissue injury repair
and cancer progression [1]. EMT is characterized by the
reversible loss of epithelial characteristics coupled with the

and zona occludens protein 1 (encoded by TJP1) and the
accumulation of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin
(encoded by VIM). Activation of EMT has been particularly
studied in breast tumorigenicity. Genome-wide transcriptional
profiling of a large set of human breast cancer cell lines
used as experimental models, defined the existence of the
basal B subgroup with enhanced invasive properties and a
mesenchymal gene expression signature, distinct from the
less aggressive luminal or mixed basal/luminal (basal A)
subgroups with a predominantly epithelial gene expression
signature [6]. At the clinical level, patients who develop breast
cancer with a basal-like molecular profile and upregulation
of EMT markers are known to have a poor clinical outcome
[7]. Consequently, an important goal in the field is identifying
factors or extracellular signals that promote EMT.
Among them, the multitasking cytokine TGFβ
frequently elevated in the tumor microenvironment
emerged as a driving force [8, 9]. Growing evidence
reveal the importance of TGFβ and oxidative stress/
reactive oxygen species (ROS) interplay in tumorigenesis
and malignancy [10]. TGFβ is able to stimulate ROS
production directly or by downregulating antioxidative
systems [11]. Till, ROS have been found to increase
TGFβ signaling and to activate latent TGFβ [10]. It is also
increasingly apparent that TGFβ signaling mediates cell
response to DNA damage and genome stability as a way to
confer resistance to cancer therapeutics [12–14].
Several recent studies also implicate the type II tissue
transglutaminase TG2 (TGM2) as a regulator of EMT. TG2
is enriched in multiple tumors and cancer stem cells, it was
shown to stimulate EMT in various cell models, confer
stemness traits and was associated with drug resistance
[15–18]. Subsequent studies revealed that TG2 links TGFβ
signaling, EMT and stem cell properties [19, 20].
Other reports have shown that Poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 (PARP1) also serves in EMT although with
distinct conclusions depending on the cellular context
[21–23]. PARP1, the founding member of the PARP family
(17 members), synthesizes polymers of ADP-ribose onto
target proteins using NAD+ as a substrate [24, 25]. Due
to the predominant function of PARP1 in DNA repair, its
inhibition appeared as the strategy of choice in various
forms of cancer to potentialize the cytotoxic action of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy or to selectively kill tumors
with dysfunctional repair [26–28]. However, most clinically
used PARP1 inhibitors bind to the PARP catalytic domain
well conserved among the PARP family members thereby
revealing a lack of specificity and raising question about
their adverse effects. A high priority is to elucidate the
biological activities of the more recently identified PARP
members. Among them, the DNA-dependent PARP3 was
specified to have key functions in the repair of doublestrand breaks through NHEJ, in class switch recombination,
in telomere segregation and microtubule spindle formation
during mitosis and in transcriptional regulation during
neuronal development in the zebrafish [29–34].

What is not yet clearly defined is the biological
interest of targeting PARP3 in cancer therapy. In this
study, we examined the transcriptional and protein
expression level of PARP3 in human breast cancer cell
lines of distinct subtypes expressing various levels of
EMT traits [6]. The general elevated expression of PARP3
associated with the mesenchymal phenotype inspired the
idea to investigate its function in the EMT program and to
delineate the molecular pathway it regulates.

RESULTS
PARP3 expression positively correlates with the
mesenchymal phenotype in human breast cancer
cell lines
In the course of our studies aimed to decipher
the biological properties of PARP3, we compared the
expression of PARP3 in a series of human breast cancer
cell lines of distinct subgroups with predominantly
luminal (luminal), mixed luminal/basal (basal A) and basal
(basal B) features [6]. We found that PARP3 expression
both at mRNA (Figure 1A) and protein levels (Figure 1B)
was predominant in the mesenchymal-like basal B subtype
while less or poorly detectable in the epithelial-like
luminal subtypes. High levels of PARP3 mRNA and
protein were often correlated with high expression of the
mesenchymal marker Vimentin and loss of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin. At the protein level, this correlation
was specific for PARP3 and not observed for PARP1. In
support of this initial observation, an extended analysis of
the published PARP3 gene expression profile in a larger
panel of breast cancer cells from the Cancer Cell line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) confirmed a significantly higher
expression of PARP3 in the basal B subtype displaying
a VIM-high and CDH1-low gene expression signature
compared to the luminal subtype (Figure 1C). Moreover,
PARP3 expression in these cell lines positively correlated
with their EMT score (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Collectively, these data suggested that PARP3 is upregulated
in breast cancer cell lines displaying a mesenchymal-like
gene expression profile and raised the question of whether
PARP3 might regulate the switch between the epithelial
and mesenchymal phenotype. However, the stable ectopic
expression of PARP3 in MCF10A or MCF7 cells was
insufficient to spontaneously induce EMT associated
alterations (Supplementary Figure S2).

PARP3 expression is increased in the course of
TGFβ-induced EMT
EMT can be triggered by various growth and
differentiation factors. Among them, TGFβ has emerged
as a key regulator of EMT in late-stage carcinomas where
it promotes invasion and metastasis [8, 9]. We therefore
examined the effects of TGFβ on PARP3 expression in

different cell lines frequently used as models of inducible
TGFβ-mediated EMT (Figure 2A). PARP3 mRNA levels
were increased in a time-dependent manner in the lung
cancer cell line A549, the hepatocellular carcinoma
cell line HepG2 and the mammary epithelial cell line
MCF10A after TGFβ stimulation. MCF10A cells are
routinely used to investigate TGFβ-induced EMT. We
therefore analysed PARP3 protein levels in this model
upon TGFβ treatment. We confirmed that PARP3 protein
level was also increased in response to TGFβ in this
model. Its upregulation correlates with the induction of
the EMT master regulator Snail and the concomittant
repression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in response
to TGFβ (Figure 2B). Based on these findings, we
suggested that PARP3 might assist the EMT commitment
of TGFβ-induced EMT.

To investigate this hypothesis, we silenced
PARP3 in MCF10A cells using siRNA approach and
analysed the impact on EMT characteristics promoted
by TGFβ (Figure 3A–3D). TGFβ treatment of MCF10A
cells resulted in EMT with transformation from a
cobblestone-like epithelial morphology to an elongated
fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 3A), dissolution of the
ZO1-stained tight junctions (Figure 3B), upregulation of
Snail and the concomitant repression of E-cadherin at both
the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 3C–3D). In contrast,
the mesenchymal marker Vimentin was only upregulated at
the mRNA level in this model. (Figure 3D). As expected,

the downregulation of PARP3 significantly impaired TGFβinduced EMT. MCF10A-siPARP3 cells treated with TGFβ
conserved a round-shaped epithelial phenotype (Figure 3A),
maintained ZO1 staining of the cell borders (Figure 3B),
showed no upregulation of Snail and no downregulation
of E-cadherin (Figure 3C–3D). In contrast, at the mRNA
level, CDH1 was even upregulated in the PARP3-silenced
cells (Figure 3D). Vimentin expression remained unchanged
throughout time (Figure 3C–3D). We regularly noticed a
decrease in the basal level of Snail upon PARP3 depletion,
but without significant consequence on the expression
levels of E-cadherin or Vimentin. An impaired upregulation
of Snail and Vimentin and an inefficient downregulation of
E-cadherin was also observed in the breast cancer MCF7
cells upon PARP3 silencing (Supplementary Figure S3A).
The TGFβ-induced EMT is characterized by increased
cell motility, a critical step in tumour progression. Given the
importance of PARP3 in promoting TGFβ-induced EMT,
we examined the effect of PARP3 silencing on the TGFβinduced cell motility using a wound-healing assay (Figure
3E) (Supplementary Movie S1). While a treatment with
TGFβ enhanced the motility of the MCF10A cells as detected
by an increased speed and efficient wound closure, this
increase was abrogated in PARP3 depleted cells suggesting
that PARP3 mediates TGFβ-stimulated cell motility.
Chemoresistance is an other phenotype that is
acquired by cells undergoing EMT [4, 35]. Both TGFβ
and PARP3 have been shown to promote cell survival and
NHEJ-mediated repair in response to genotoxic agents
inducing double-strand breaks [12, 29, 30, 33]. To test the
importance of PARP3 in chemoresistance, we evaluated the
sensitivity of TGFβ-treated MCF10A cells to etoposide,
a potent inducer of double-strand breaks, after PARP3
depletion (Figure 3F). Relative to TGFβ untreated cells,
MCF10A cultures treated with TGFβ became markedly
less sensitive to etoposide indicating resistance to the DNA
damage inflicted by etoposide. In contrast, PARP3-silenced
MCF10A cells treated with TGFβ did not show this
resistance arguing that the depletion of PARP3 abolished
chemoresistance in cells undergoing TGFβ-mediated
EMT. Similar results were obtained using bleomycin
(Supplementary Figure S3B). These results suggested that
the enhanced expression of PARP3 is required to confer
chemoresistance in TGFβ-induced EMT.

agreement with the litterature, TGFβ treatment resulted in the
increase of the protein levels of the stemness markers SOX2
and OCT4 [37]. Compared to MCF10A cells, MCF10AsiPARP3 cells revealed significantly decreased basal and
TGFβ-induced levels of OCT4 and the TGFβ-induced level of
SOX2, while PARP3 overexpression in the MCF10A-PARP3
cells clearly enhanced the basal level of both markers and to
a lesser extent their TGFβ-induced levels. Corroborating the
role of PARP3 in TGFβ-induced EMT, the absence of PARP3
impaired the upregulation of Snail while its overexpression in
the MCF10A-PARP3 clearly increased its basal and TGFβinduced levels. Similar results were obtained using the breast
cancer MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S4A). To further
study the importance of PARP3 in breast stem cell activity,
we used the tumor spheroids forming assay to evaluate the
capacity for mammosphere formation in non-adherent serumfree conditions [38] (Figure 4B, 4C). MCF10A-PARP3
cells revealed a marked increase in the number of primary
mammospheres compared to the MCF10A control cells
independently of TGFβ. In turn, MCF10A-siPARP3 showed
a decrease in the number and size of primary mammospheres
with and without TGFβ. Similar results were observed
in the MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S4B, S4C).
Thus arguing that PARP3 is involved in primary spheroid
bodies formation of mammary epithelial and breast cancer
cells. Next, we analyzed PARP3-overexpressing MCF10A
cells for the presence of tumor initiating CD44high/CD24low
population characteristic for the mammary and breast cancer
stem cells (Figure 4D). Flow cytometric analysis revealed
a significant 4-fold increase in the proportion of CD44high/
CD24low cells in the MCF10A-PARP3 versus the MCF10A
control cells again independently of TGFβ. To explore the
contribution of PARP3 in stem self-renewal, we examined
the capacity of the MCF10A control and MCF10A-PARP3
primary spheres to generate secondary, third and fourth
generation of mammospheres in serial passages (Figure 4E).
MCF10A-PARP3 displayed an increased capacity to selfrenew throughout passages compared to the MCF10A control
cells. Similar results were observed in the MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Figure S4D). Furthermore, throughout
the serial passages of mammospheres, the protein level of
the stemness marker OCT4 remained higher in the MCF7PARP3 then in the MCF7 control cells (Supplementary
Figure S4E). These results indicated that PARP3 helps to
maintain stem cell renewal capacity in mammary epithelial
and breast cancer cells.
Collectively, these data revealed that PARP3 endows
human mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells
with stem cell properties.

PARP3 promotes stem-like cell properties
There is evidence that EMT generates cells with stemlike characteristics [3–5]. In addition, TGFβ signaling has
been implicated in stemness [36, 37]. On the basis of our
results that PARP3 supports TGFβ-mediated EMT, we next
investigated its participation in stem-like cell phenotypes.
We examined the impact of PARP3 on the expression of
representative stem cell markers in MCF10A cells in the
absence or in the presence of TGFβ, using the above described
PARP3 depletion or overexpression models (Figure 4A). In

transcriptome changes in MCF10A cells upon PARP3
depletion and TGFβ treatment in MCF10A cells using a
microarray approach (Figure 5A). From the 538 coding
genes responding to TGFβ in our experimental conditions,
we identified a handful of genes that were differentially
deregulated in the PARP3-silenced MCF10A cells
compared to the control MCF10A cells (23 genes, 0,5≥
FCTGFβ ≥ 2, p value < 0,001). Among them, we focused
our interest on the tissue transglutaminase TG2 that in
a similar manner as PARP3 was documented to have
prominent roles in TGFβ-induced EMT, the acquisition
of stem cell features and chemoresistance [19, 39]. These
similarities evoked a causal link between PARP3 and TG2.
We first validated the differential expression of TG2 in
MCF10A and MCF10A-siPARP3 cells in response to TGFβ
by a time course RT-qPCR and western blot analysis (Figure
5B, 5C). Consistent with efficient EMT in MCF10A cells,
TG2 and Snail markers were up-regulated while E-cadherin
was down-regulated in response to TGFβ at both mRNA
and protein levels. As expected, deregulation of these EMT
markers was significantly perturbed in MCF10A-siPARP3
cells, TG2 and Snail levels remained low and E-cadherin
level high in agreement with impaired EMT as stated above
(Figure 3). Similar results were obtained in the breast cancer
MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Given that TG2
is required for the expression of Snail during EMT [16],
these data suggested that PARP3 stimulates a TG2-Snail-Ecadherin axis to support TGFβ-dependent EMT.
To verify this hypothesis, we examined the impact of
TG2 on Snail up-regulation and consequent repression of
E-cadherin stimulated by TGFβ and PARP3 overexpression
in MCF10A cells (Figure 5D). Compared to the MCF10A
control cells with low basal PARP3, PARP3 overexpression
in MCF10A-PARP3 cells increased the TGFβ-induced
expression of TG2 and Snail and consequently decreased
E-cadherin. Remarkably, these effects were significantly
diminished upon TG2 depletion using siRNA. Thus
confirming that in response to TGFβ, PARP3 promotes
a TG2-Snail-E-cadherin axis to induce EMT. Similarly,
the PARP3-stimulated expression of the stemness marker
OCT4 detected in the absence or presence of TGFβ in
MCF10A-PARP3 cells was diminished upon TG2 depletion
indicating that the genesis of stem cells is also at least partly
mediated by a PARP3-TG2 pathway.

cells. Western blotting revealed an increase in the protein
level of PARP3 upon treatment with the ROS inducing
agents H202, paraquat and menadione when compared
to the untreated cells. PARP3 upregulation upon H202
treatment was abolished in the presence of the ROS
scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (Figure 6A). We
then examined the sensitivity of the Parp3+/+ and Parp3/mouse embryonic fibroblasts to paraquat and menadione
by clonogenic survival assays. The absence of Parp3
rendered cells hypersensitive to both drugs (Figure 6B).
These findings uncovered an important role of PARP3 in
cellular response to the generation of ROS.
Next we tested whether TGFβ-induced ROS
production contributed to the enhanced expression of TG2
and Snail, or the repression of E-cadherin in MCF10A
cells. The treatment with NAC notably reduced the
TGFβ-dependent expression of TG2 and Snail and the
concomittant repression of E-cadherin at both mRNA and
protein levels, indicating that the TGFβ-induced expression
of EMT markers is ROS dependent (Figure 6C, 6D).
Similarly, the TGFβ-dependent upregulation of PARP3 in
the MCF10A-PARP3 was notably reduced in the presence
of NAC (Figure 6E). The above findings prompted us to
interrogate whether PARP3 mediates the TGFβ and ROS
dependent activation of the TG2-Snail-E-adherin axis and
the expression of the stemness marker OCT4 (Figure 6E).
As described above (Figure 5), compared to the MCF10A
control cells displaying low levels of endogenous PARP3,
PARP3 overexpression in MCF10A-PARP3 enhanced the
TGFβ-stimulated expression of TG2 and Snail and further
repressed E-cadherin. These effects were significantly
diminished in the presence of NAC demonstrating the
importance of ROS. Similarly, the PARP3-stimulated
expression of the stemness marker OCT4 detected in the
absence or presence of TGFβ was abrogated in the presence
of NAC. Comparable results were obtained in the MCF7
cells (Supplementary Figure S5).
Collectively, these findings identified PARP3 as a
TGFβ and ROS responsive protein and demonstrated that
PARP3 supports TGFβ-dependent EMT traits in a ROS
dependent manner by stimulating a TG2-Snail-E-cadherin
axis.

PARP3 responds to TGFβ-induced ROS to
promote the TG2-Snail-E-cadherin axis during
EMT

Based on our initial observation that PARP3 levels
are generally higher in the mesenchymal-like basal B
breast cancer cell lines that display EMT properties and
correlate with the EMT score, we aimed to decipher the
contribution of PARP3 in this process. We report that
PARP3 serves TGFβ-dependent EMT and stemness by
stimulating a TG2-Snail-E-cadherin axis in a manner
involving its response to TGFβ-induced ROS.
This mode of regulation reveals a novel function
of PARP3 in cellular response to ROS, in addition to its
well characterized implication in double-strand break

DISCUSSION

Accumulating evidence suggests that ROS play
important roles in TGFβ-induced EMT [10]. In pursuit
of the mechanism by which PARP3 regulates the TG2Snail-E-cadherin axis and promotes EMT, we decided to
investigate the importance of ROS in this pathway (Figure
6). We first asked whether PARP3 is involved in cell
response to oxidative damage using the MCF10A-PARP3

repair [29, 30, 33]. The fact that PARP3 is upregulated
and responds to ROS produced from both exogenous
(genotoxic agents) and endogenous (TGFβ) sources
makes it a major driver of the ROS response that is
likely to function in various other physiological and
pathophysiological events. One interesting example is
suggested by the prominent role of PARP3 in neural crest
cell differentiation in the zebrafish [32], a process in which
the generation of ROS by the NADPH oxidase NOX4 was
documented to be required for efficient differentiation
[40]. Whether PARP3 might be involved in the base
excision repair (BER) pathway that processes oxidative
lesions is undetermined, but consistent with its interaction
with the BER proteins PARP1 and DNA ligase III and
the recent biochemical demonstration that PARP3 can be
selectively activated by 5’ phosphorylated DNA breaks,
defined as prevalent intermediates of the BER pathway
[41, 42].
The causal relationship between PARP3 and TG2 to
regulate the EMT master regulator Snail is grounded by the
considerable functional similarities between these proteins
: (i) they promote mesenchymal properties, cell migration,
wound healing [39, 43, 44]; (ii) their expression is induced
by genotoxic stress and they prime a drug resistance
phenotype [29, 45, 46]; (iii) they confer cancer stem-like
cell traits [18, 44]. The microarray and RT-qPCR analyses
suggest that PARP3 controls the transcriptional expression
of TGM2. We have yet to elucidate the mechanism involved.
An interesting hypothesis originates from the existence of
a TG2/NF-κB self-reinforcing signaling loop identified
in breast cancer cells, and that was proposed to influence
EMT and produce a drug-resistant phenotype [47]. TG2
was found to activate NF-κB and was reciprocally identified
as a direct transcriptional target of NF-κB [47, 48]. Most
notably, it was proposed that in response to cellular stressors
such as oxidative stress, an ATM-dependent activation of
the canonical NFκB pathway drives heightened expression
of TG2 [45]. In view of the role of PARP3 in the activation
of ATM [31] and the PARP3 response to ROS identified
here, one possible mechanism would be that PARP3 guides
an ATM-NF-κB-TG2-Snail route to boost TGFβ-induced
EMT and cause drug-resistance. A fuller appreciation
of this mechanism will require a more detailed study on
how PARP3 responds to oxidative stress and whether such
a redox sensor activity may, either directly or indirectly
engage the ATM-NF-κB couple.
The fact that PARP3 contributes to the drug
resistance phenotype mediated by TGFβ is substantiated
by the recent findings that both PARP3 and TGFβ
accelerate NHEJ repair activity in two similar ways, by
facilitating the retention of DNA ligase IV at the sites
of DNA damage and by promoting ATM activation [12,
13, 31, 33]. Although the mechanism involved remains
to be determined, it is reasonable to speculate that the
upregulation of PARP3 represents one possible way by
which TGFβ facilitates NHEJ.

The other outstanding result of this study is the
marked role of PARP3 in the genesis and function of
mammary and breast cancer stem cells illustrated by its
contribution in mammosphere formation, the expression of
the stemness markers OCT4 and SOX2, and the frequency
of the tumor initiating CD44high/CD24low population. The
puzzling observation is the strict TGFβ-dependence of
PARP3 to regulate the mesenchymal properties while the
importance of TGFβ for the modulation of stem-like traits
is less pronounced. This might be the result of a broader role
of PARP3 in stem cell development. PARP3 might not only
regulate TGFβ-dependent EMT for the emergence of stem
cells, but also other specific stem cell regulators that play
causal roles in stemness. The importance of ROS in this
function is suggested by the finding that PARP3 regulates
the expression of OCT4 in a ROS-dependent manner. In
view of the critical importance of cancer stem cells in
tumor dissemination, the observation that PARP3 promotes
stem-like cell characteristics supports our initial observation
that invasive basal-like cancer cell lines express higher basal
levels of PARP3. An other interesting hypothesis to consider
in forthcoming studies is the link between PARP3 and the
Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2) for the regulation
of EMT and stemness. Indeed, PARP3 associates with
components of the PRC2 complex, both proteins share the
regulation of overlapping neural developmental genes and
the role of PRC2 in the epigenetic control of TGFβ-induced
EMT and stem cell development has been documented in
various normal and disease contexts [32, 42, 49, 50].
In conclusion, our data provide evidence that PARP3
drives TGFβ-mediated EMT and stem cell development in
normal mammary and breast cancer cells and that these
activities involve a PARP3 response to the generation of
ROS. In the cancer field, EMT markers and mediators
have been particularly associated with basal invasive
breast cancer subtypes with often a poor clinical outcome.
The identification of EMT drivers as specific therapeutic
targets represents a continuous challenge. Similarly, given
the importance of cancer stem cells in drug resistance,
tumor initiation and tumor recurrence, clarifying
the mechanisms involved has important therapeutic
implications. Consequently, our findings support the idea
that targeting PARP3 may have a clear potential benefit
to restrain cancer related TGFβ-promoted EMT and may
be used as an advantage to target cancer stem cells. The
current active tracking in the development of potent cellpermeant PARP3 inhibitors will be valuable in exploring
these strategies [51–53].

using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithms
with default settings. Differentially expressed genes were
selected using the fold change based method [54].

Western blot analysis
For PARP3 expression analysis in HBC cell lines
(Figure 1B), cells were collected and lysed by incubation
in ice for 10 minutes in RIPA-like buffer (50mM Tris pH
8, 1% triton, 0,5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate
pH 7,2, 1 mM sodium orthotovanadate, 1 mM Pefabloc,
PIC). After centrifugation at 10000 rpm at 4°C for 20
min, cleared suspension was quantified by Bradford
protein assay. Equivalent amounts of proteins were next
analysed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using
the appropriate antibodies (Listed in Supplementary Table
S1). Protein bands were visualized using ECL-PLUS
detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and the images
were captured using the Image Quant LAS 4000 imaging

Blue Bromophenol 0,01%, Na3VO4 1mM, NaF 50mM,
Pefabloc 0,5mM added before use) and sonicated using
Bioruptor UCD-300 system. Normalization of the
samples was performed by running a 10% SDS-PAGE
and in-gel quantification of total protein stained with
Coomassie using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences) and the analysis software Image
J. Equivalent amounts of proteins were next analysed
by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the
appropriate antibodies (Listed in Supplementary Table
S1). Protein bands were visualized as mentionned above.

Microarray and RT-qPCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
For RT-qPCR, DNase-treated RNA was processed
