Summary
Author Manuscript

Over 90% of drugs with preclinical activity fail in human trials, largely due to insufficient efficacy.
We hypothesized that adequately powered trials of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in mice could
efficiently define therapeutic activity across heterogeneous tumors. To address this hypothesis, we
established a large, publically available repository of well-characterized leukemia and lymphoma
PDXs that undergo orthotopic engraftment called the Public Repository of Xenografts (PRoXe;
www.proxe.org). PRoXe includes all de-identified information relevant to the primary specimens
and the PDXs derived from them. Using this repository, we demonstrate that large studies of acute
leukemia PDXs that mimic human randomized clinical trials can characterize drug efficacy and
generate transcriptional, functional and proteomic biomarkers in both treatment-naïve and
relapsed/refractory disease.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Essentially all oncology therapeutic candidates tested in humans have preclinical activity yet
over 90% of these agents fail during clinical development (Kola and Landis, 2004; Ledford,
2011; Mak et al., 2014). This lamentable status quo results largely from a lack of efficacy in
clinical trials. These trials, which generally evaluate agents in unselected patient populations
with relapsed and refractory disease, are large, expensive and empiric. Thus, there is a
desperate need for efficient and broadly applicable methods for preclinical assessment that
have improved predictive value for human testing (Mak et al., 2014).
Cancer cell lines have significant limitations in their ability to model the biology and
therapeutic responsiveness of cancers in their native microenvironment (Abaan et al., 2013;

Gillet et al., 2011; Hausser and Brenner, 2005). The diversity of cancer, based on extensive
genomic and transcriptional studies, is remarkably underrepresented by the number of
available cell lines. This is even more problematic for transgenic murine models, which exist
for a very small number of genetically-defined cancer subtypes. For example, there are over
100 different diagnostic subtypes of hematologic malignancies alone and almost all of these
encompass multiple distinct genetic entities based on the presence of well-defined
chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidies and/or single/oligonucleotide sequence
alterations (Jaffe et al., 2008). Among the cell lines that do exist, adaptation to in vitro
culture and passaging for hundreds or even thousands of generations exerts substantial
selective pressure that is not reverted by subcutaneous or even orthotopic xenografting
(Daniel et al., 2009; Gillet et al., 2011; Hausser and Brenner, 2005). Nearly all cell lines are
derived from patients who were previously untreated and/or from sites (e.g. pleural
effusions) that are very uncommonly involved by their tumor types. For these reasons, the
available cell lines are not representative of either the genetic abnormalities or treatment
status of most patient tumors that will receive treatment in early phase trials. Finally, trials of
in vivo therapeutics performed by subcutaneous xenografting of cell lines into the mouse
flank fail to capture microenvironmental interactions that can modulate therapeutic efficacy
(Aparicio et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established within highly immunocompromised mice
overcome many of these shortcomings (Bertotti et al., 2011; Fichtner et al., 2008; Hidalgo et
al., 2014; Julien et al., 2012; Reyal et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). PDXs are passaged only
in vivo and thereby avoid the selective pressures from ex vivo culture. They can be collected
from patients with typical presentations of disease, either upfront or in the relapsed/
refractory setting. Because engraftment rates are high for a variety of tumor types, very large
repositories can be established to more broadly capture the range of human cancer. For
example, a bank of over 1,000 solid tumor PDXs (mostly treatment-naïve) was recently
reported (Gao et al., 2015). Large therapeutic studies of small molecule inhibitors in these
PDXs recapitulated population-based response frequencies that were observed in clinical
trials. In addition, the synergy identified between IGF1R inhibitors and multiple agents in
cell lines was not observed in PDXs (Gao et al., 2015), a proof-of-principle that in vivo
studies with PDXs may challenge results from cell lines.

Author Manuscript

In some settings, primary cancers can be orthotopically xenografted to recapitulate
microenvironmental interactions within patients. The study by Gao et al. utilized
subcutaneous flank xenografts of solid tumors, and as such, therapeutic efficacy was based
on reduced growth or regression relative to vehicle-treated animals (Gao et al., 2015). In
contrast, acute leukemias and other bone marrow-resident disorders readily undergo
orthotopic engraftment after tail-vein or intra-osseous injection (Liem et al., 2004). As a
result, therapeutic trials in mice engrafted with these diseases can utilize endpoints like
overall survival or time to disease progression, just as in human trials. Mice can be treated
until they progress on therapy, which allows for the development of acquired resistance.
Samples can be taken from the peripheral blood or by sacrificing sentinel animals at multiple
timepoints to establish biomarkers of response and resistance. Passaging in adequate
numbers of animals also generates essentially unlimited numbers of primary cells for
agnostic and targeted discovery efforts.

The central concern over PDXs is that they may fail to capture phenotypic, transcriptional,
genetic and other characteristics of the tumors from which they were derived (Aparicio et
al., 2015; Klco et al., 2014). Despite this concern, multiple entities now offer xenografting of
patient tumors followed by in vivo drug testing, which they market as predictive of clinical
response. We do not consider that each PDX is directly representative of the clinical sample
from which it was derived. Instead, we hypothesize that using PDXs to conduct statistically
powered, randomized trials in mice can efficiently define therapeutic activity across a broad
range of genetically distinct tumor xenografts and inform the design and execution of human
trials. At the same time, these preclinical trials can be used to establish biomarkers
predictive of response, to generate models of drug resistance after in vivo exposure, and to
interrogate aspects of in vivo biology, including tropism. In order to address this hypothesis,
we aimed to establish a large repository of well-characterized PDXs of hematologic
malignancies and implement these PDXs in comprehensive preclinical studies of candidate
therapeutics in mice.

Results
Establishment of Patient Derived Xenografts

Author Manuscript

Primary bone marrow and blood specimens from patients with leukemia and lymphoma
were xenografted into Nod.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rg<tm1Wjl>/SzJ (NSG) mice. Success rates for
engraftment in first passage (i.e., P0) after tail-vein injection varied based on disease
subtype: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL; 67.5%), T-cell ALL (T-ALL;
46.7%); acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 23.2%), and all lymphomas (20.3%).
Engraftment into P1 recipients also varied by disease, with very high rates of engraftment
for B-ALL (95.3%) and lower rates for AML (65.7%), T-ALL (75%), and all lymphomas
(76.9%) by 8 months after injection. Thirteen (30.2%) of 43 additional lymphomas engrafted
in P0 within 6 months after tumor seeds obtained from tissue biopsies were implanted under
the renal capsule.
Table 1 outlines the current repository based on the 2008 World Health Organization
classification (Jaffe et al., 2008). In addition to a range of acute leukemia subtypes, we
established multiple PDXs representative of lymphomas with no or very few available cell
lines or in vivo models, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL; Figure
S1A,B), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (Figure S1C), breast implant-associated anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (Figure S1D), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified
(PTCL-NOS; Figure S1E), blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN; Figure
S1F), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; Figure S1G).

Multiple models demonstrated tropism within recipient mice that mimicked the clinical
disease. For example, Sézary Syndrome is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with
peripheral blood involvement. We injected peripheral blood from a patient with Sézary
Syndrome into the tail-vein of NSG mice and the cells trafficked to and involved the mouse
skin (Figure S1H), establishing a unique model of human lymphoma epidermotropism.
Similarly, a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from a patient who did not have
central nervous system (CNS) involvement engrafted under the renal capsule in P0. That
tumor was dissociated into a single-cell suspension and injected by tail-vein into P1 mice.

All 5 (100%) injected mice succumbed with CNS involvement by DLBCL (Figure S1I–K).
Despite the difficulty of developing low-grade lymphoma models in vivo, a marginal zone
lymphoma engrafted as a low-grade, CD20+ lymphoma after implantation under the renal
capsule (Figure S1L) and a follicular lymphoma engrafted with small BCL2-positive, CD20positive lymphocytes. Similarly, two different mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) that involved
blood and bone marrow in patients also involved the blood, bone marrow and spleen of
xenografted mice (Figure S1M). Even more remarkably, MCL obtained from the blood of a
patient with blood, nodal and gastrointestinal involvement trafficked to each of these sites
after tail vein injection (Movie S1).

Author Manuscript

In early passage, some PDXs maintained human, non-malignant cell populations that were
present in the original tumor. For example, the PTCL-NOS engrafted in P0 with populations
of non-malignant CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as well as a rare population of EBV-positive Bcells (Figure S1E). Some PTCLs harbor a small subset of EBV-positive B-cells (Jaffe et al.,
2008) but the role of these cells in disease development and persistence has not been
defined.
Transcriptional, genetic and phenotype characterization of PDXs confirms subtype fidelity

Author Manuscript

We confirmed lineage fidelity in 157 PDXs by flow cytometry for markers including human
CD3 (T cell), CD19 (B cell), CD33 (early myeloid), CD34 (hematopoietic progenitor) and
CD45 (pan-hematopoietic). Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on
107 PDXs in addition to targeted DNA sequencing of all exons of 205 hematologic
malignancy-associated genes (Odejide et al., 2014) (Table S1, S2). Analysis of RNAseq data
was implemented as a Snakemake (Koster and Rahmann, 2012) workflow. To permit similar
analyses by other users, the complete workflow documenting all utilized parameters and
tools is available at: https://bitbucket.org/cfce/weinstock-leukemia. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering based on disease type (AML, T-ALL, B-ALL, BPDCN, or lymphoma
(Figure 1, Table S3) correctly clustered 105 (98%) of the 107 PDXs. A broad diversity of
genetic alterations is captured within the PDXs, including targetable lesions (e.g. mutations
of IDH1, IDH2 or JAK2, rearrangements involving MLL or ABL).

Author Manuscript

Among B-ALL PDXs, interrogation of RNAseq data for gene fusions rediscovered 28
(96.6%) of 29 fusions identified by clinical cytogenetics analysis of the patient samples,
including BCR-ABL1, MLL, ETV6-AML1, and TCF3-PBX1 rearrangements (Figure S2A).
In addition, previously unrecognized fusions involving PAX5, JAK2, KDM6A, RUNX1,
CRLF2 and SPI1 were recovered from the PDXs, with fusion transcripts from both
derivative chromosomes identified in multiple PDXs (Figure S2A). Interrogation of the
transcriptomes from AML PDXs similarly identified both known and unrecognized fusions
(Figure S2B).
Next, we performed unsupervised clustering of transcriptomes from B-ALL PDXs in
combination with transcriptomes of primary B-ALLs and B-ALL cell lines from the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (Figure 2, Table S4) (Barretina et al., 2012). To permit analysis of
the aggregated data, quantile normalization (Limma 3.26.1 (Ritchie et al., 2015)) was first
performed to adjust for library depth and platform-specific differences. Principle
components analysis revealed that the primary source of post-normalization variation

derived from batch effects. These batch effects within each general diagnostic category
(AML, B-ALL, T-ALL, lymphoma) were successfully removed using the ComBat approach
from SVA 3.18.00 (Leek and Storey, 2007) agnostic of additional clinical and molecular
covariates. Hierarchical clustering with Ward’s linkage and Euclidean distance over the 1000
genes with the greatest variance-to-mean ratio was performed over all diagnostic categories
(PDX dataset only) and for each diagnostic category separately (all three datasets) (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).

Author Manuscript

Compared with cell lines, PDXs spanned a broader diversity of WHO diagnostic categories,
patient demographic characteristics, phases of treatment, prior therapies, cytogenetic
profiles, and genotypes (Figure 2). At present, there are 28 B-cell leukemia cell lines
available through the German cell line repository DSMZ, of which only 10 have RNA
expression data available through the CCLE. In contrast, we have generated 115 B-ALL
PDX lines, of which 82 have RNA expression data already available. Unsupervised
clustering underscored the biologic influence of canonical fusion genes such as those
involving MLL, BCR-ABL1, TEL-AML1, and E2A-PBX1. Although fewer cases were
analyzed, separate clustering of AML, T-ALL and lymphomas identified distinct clades in
each disease (Figures S2C–E). Lymphoma samples segregated by cell lineage (B vs. T), with
canonical fusion genes correlating with a number of derivative clades, including CCND1IGH+ MCL, NPM1-ALK+ ALCL, and DLBCLs with concurrent rearrangements of MYC
and BCL2 (Figure S2E).
PRoXe: A resource to facilitate studies of leukemia and lymphoma PDXs

Author Manuscript

To massively expand the widespread use of these models and the data derived from them, we
established an open source web portal called the Public Repository of Xenografts (PRoXe;
www.proxe.org). We created PRoXe using Shiny, a web application library for R that
permits the fluid integration and analysis of heterogeneous data types in a graphical user
interface. All underlying code for PRoXe is freely available on GitHub (https://
bitbucket.org/scottkall/proxe).

Author Manuscript

PRoXe provides extensive patient, tumor, PDX, and germline administrative information for
each line. Any of the 56 characteristics that are categorical or quantitative can be visualized
interactively via histograms, barplots, scatterplots, and boxplots, allowing the user to
dynamically interrogate individual variables as well as interactions between these variables.
Flow cytometry plots, full-color immunohistochemistry images, detailed pathology reports,
and class I HLA alleles inferred from RNAseq (Shukla et al., 2015) are available for a subset
of lines. RNA expression in the form of log-transformed RPKM derived from RNAseq can
be visualized as bar plots or heat maps for individual genes or panels of genes for selected
PDX lines. Curated mutations among panels of genes identified by targeted exon sequencing
can be visualized in matrix form using a publically available OncoPrint script (https://
gist.github.com/armish/564a65ab874a770e2c26). RPKMs and mutation calls are also being
uploaded to the cBio portal (www.cbioportal.org).

Randomized phase II-like trial in PDXs

Author Manuscript

We tested the utility of our large PDX repository by designing and performing a phase IIlike preclinical trial following the same approaches utilized in human trials. Small molecule
inhibitors that disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction have proven effective in a subset of tumor
models and patient tumors with wild-type p53 (Andreeff et al., 2015; Jeay et al., 2015; Lv et
al., 2015; Weisberg et al., 2015). In contrast, tumors with pathogenic TP53 mutations or
biallelic deletions are typically resistant to MDM2 inhibition. The MDM2 inhibitor
CGM097 is currently in phase I clinical trials for patients with solid tumors that have wildtype TP53 (Jeay et al., 2015; Weisberg et al., 2015). Approximately 85% of B-ALLs lack
TP53 alterations (Pui et al., 2004), suggesting that this agent may have broad activity across
a heterogeneous panel of PDXs.

Author Manuscript

One significant benefit to performing trials in PDXs (compared with human trials) is that
each xenograft can be injected into multiple animals, which allows for direct comparison
between drug and control in the same cancer. To test the reproducibility of using only one
vehicle-treated and one CMG097-treated mouse per PDX, we performed a pilot study on
eight PDXs, in which six mice were injected with each PDX. Of the six, three mice were
randomized to receive vehicle and three to receive CGM097 100 mg/kg by oral gavage
beginning upon engraftment (defined as ≥2% peripheral blood hCD45+ cells). One of the
three from each cohort was randomly selected prior to beginning therapy and considered a
distinct cohort. Survival from the 3 vs. 3 study and the 1 vs. 1 study showed outstanding
correlation for both drug-treated and vehicle-treated arms (Figure 3A). This strongly
supports a 1 mouse/cohort study design in B-ALL PDXs.

Author Manuscript

The primary pre-defined endpoint of the full phase II-like study was overall survival in
animals treated with CGM097 daily compared to animals treated with vehicle. The trial was
designed to detect a 40% difference in survival at 50 days of treatment assuming 60% alive
in the treated group versus 20% alive in the untreated group using a one-sided Fisher exact
test at the 0.05 level with 84% power. These estimates were based on the 8 PDX pilot study
(Figure 3A). Pre-defined subset analyses included comparisons of median survival between
vehicle and CGM097 treatment of leukemias with wild-type TP53 from patients who are:
age <18 years old, age ≥18 years old, male sex, female sex, untreated for B-ALL, or have
relapsed/refractory disease after treatment.

Author Manuscript

We injected 29 PDXs into four mice each and monitored animals weekly for engraftment
(Figure S3A). Two PDXs were not included in the final analysis due to failure to engraft,
one PDX was excluded because of death of one animal prior to engraftment, and two
additional PDXs were censored from the survival analysis due to failure of the vehicletreated mouse to meet criteria for sacrifice by day +120 of treatment (Figure S3A). Thus, the
final cohort included 24 different PDXs, including 4 that harbored TP53 mutations (Table 2).
Engraftment across the four mice for each PDX was very similar (Figure S3B). Upon
engraftment, two mice from each PDX were randomly selected to receive vehicle and two
mice received CGM097. After 26 hours (two hours after the second dose), one animal from
each cohort was sacrificed to assess pharmacodynamic (PD) markers and the remaining two
animals were followed until they met criteria for sacrifice.

CGM097 extends survival across a diverse panel of B-ALL PDXs with wild-type TP53

Author Manuscript

CGM097 conferred no survival benefit in the 4 PDXs with TP53 mutations (Figure 3B–C,
Table 2). In contrast, CGM097 conferred a survival benefit of ≥10 days in 19 of 20 PDXs
with wild-type TP53 (Figure 3C). For the one exception (PDX 34953), both animals
required sacrifice at day 86 of treatment due to dermatitis and lethargy but neither had
splenomegaly or significant numbers of B-ALL cells upon necropsy, suggesting that
mortality was unrelated to leukemia progression. The pre-defined primary endpoint (overall
survival at day 50 of treatment) was statistically in favor of CGM097 treatment (80% versus
20% among the 20 TP53 wild-type PDXs; p=0.0004 by two-sided Fisher’s exact test). The
difference remained statistically significant (p=0.0012) if all 24 PDXs were included.

Author Manuscript

Among the 20 PDXs with wild-type TP53, median survival was improved by a median value
of 44 days in the CGM097 cohort (Figure 3B). The gradual downward slope of the survival
curve for the 20 mice treated with vehicle demonstrates the heterogeneity in disease
progression across the B-ALL PDXs. Similarly, the gradual separation between the vehicletreated and CGM097-treated curves for the 20 PDXs demonstrates heterogeneity in the
extent of disease control by CGM097. This data is also captured in a “randomized
Swimmer’s plot” in Figure 3C, which further shows the broad variability in both absolute
and relative survival benefit conferred by CGM097 treatment across PDXs.

Author Manuscript

Pre-defined subset analyses demonstrated statistical superiority for the CGM097 treatment
arm in 5 of 6 cohorts with wild-type TP53: age <18 years old, male sex, female sex, (Figure
S3C) previously untreated, and relapsed/refractory (Figure 3D). In fact, treatment with
CGM097 improved survival of mice engrafted with PDXs from relapsed/refractory B-ALL
by 45 days (65 vs. 20 days for vehicle) (Figure 3D). This provides strong preclinical
evidence for testing CGM097 in patients who have received extensive treatment for B-ALL
but maintain wild-type TP53, including children.
PDX studies allow for the development of pharmacodynamic endpoints and biomarkers
predictive of response

Author Manuscript

To assess transcriptional correlates of CGM097 activity, we designed a custom NanoString
panel that included p53 targets and modulators of p53 activity (Table S5). We applied this
assay to purified PDX cells obtained from mice treated with either vehicle or CGM097 at
both the PD and survival (SUR) timepoints. Nine genes were differentially expressed in
CGM097-treated PDXs with wild-type TP53 at the PD timepoint (≥1.2-fold over vehicletreated, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p value <0.05) (Table S6). In addition, all
vehicle-treated and CGM097-treated samples at both timepoints were subjected to
agglomerative clustering on expression of a curated set of p53 target genes (Figure S4A)
(GenePattern) (Riley et al., 2008). Visual inspection of the resulting heatmap revealed a
cluster of genes strongly expressed in 10 CGM097-treated PD samples, 3 CGM097-treated
SUR samples and 1 vehicle-treated SUR sample. The genes in this cluster included
GADD45A, BBC3, MDM2, ACTA2, FAS, BAX, DDB2, CDKN1A, FDXR, TNFRSF10B,
PRKAB1, CCNG1, SESN1 RPS27L and RRM2B. This p53 target cluster included 7 of 9
genes identified solely by differential expression analysis in PD samples, as well as 10 of 13
genes identified in a signature that predicted response to CGM097 in cell lines and solid

tumor xenografts (Jeay et al., 2015). Combining the two analyses generated an 18 gene set
of CGM097-dependent p53 target genes (Figure S4B, Figure 4A). The 18 genes included all
7 genes (BAX, BBC3, CDKN1A, FDXR, MDM2, TNFRSF10B and ZMAT3) that were
previously reported to increase expression in patient tumors after treatment with the MDM2
inhibitor RG7112 (Andreeff et al., 2015). This overlap is remarkable, as the previous
signatures (Andreeff et al., 2015; Jeay et al., 2015) were established with untreated
specimens (i.e. as predictive biomarkers) while our gene set was established on treated
leukemias (i.e. as a pharmacodynamic biomarker). As expected, expression of the 18 gene
set did not differ between vehicle- and CGM097-treated samples from PDXs with TP53
mutations (Figure 4A).

Author Manuscript

Induction of both p53 and p21 protein expression by CGM097 in TP53 wild-type PDXs was
confirmed by immunoblotting and IHC in spleen (Figure 4B–C). Expression levels of p21
protein closely paralleled the normalized levels of CDKN1A (which encodes p21) transcript
(Figure 4B).

Author Manuscript

The Letai laboratory previously demonstrated that dynamic BH3 profiling can predict the
response of tumor cells to both chemotherapy and targeted agents in vitro and in vivo
(Montero et al., 2015). To determine the accuracy of dynamic BH3 profiling as a predictive
assay for in vivo response to CGM097, we harvested cells from spleens of vehicle-treated
animals at the SUR timepoint and treated ex vivo for 18 hours with 2 μM CGM097 or
DMSO. Cells were then analyzed by FACS-based dynamic BH3 profiling using BH3
peptides derived from PUMA or NOXA, and the increase in priming from CGM097
treatment (expressed by Δ% priming values) was established for each PDX. Of note,
dynamic BH3 profiling was performed blinded as to in vivo response. The Δ% priming by
PUMA, which is capable of binding to multiple antiapoptotic proteins from the BCL-2
family, perfectly discriminated B-ALL PDXs with ≥12 days improvement in overall survival
from CGM097 treatment (p=0.0034; area under curve for receiver operating characteristic =
1.00) (Figure 4D–E). In contrast, Δ% priming with a NOXA peptide that specifically binds
to the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 did not predict survival benefit (p=0.384). Thus,
dynamic BH3 profiling using a PUMA peptide is an excellent binary predictor to accurately
determine CGM097 sensitivity in B-ALL PDXs. Of note, BBC3, which encodes PUMA,
was one of the signature genes induced by CGM097 treatment at the PD timepoint (Table
S6).

Author Manuscript

Of the nine genes upregulated in CGM097-treated PDXs at the PD timepoint, six were
significantly (nominal p value <0.05) reduced in the CGM097-treated SUR samples relative
to the CGM097-treated PD samples (Table S7). When clustering was performed on the 18
gene set by timepoint and treatment arm, there was a clear reduction in expression of these
genes in the majority of CGM097-treated SUR samples. However, in 4 samples that
progressed on CGM097, induction of p53 targets was sustained at the SUR timepoint,
suggesting at least two classes of CGM097 resistant samples. In class I, expression of
CGM097-dependent p53 targets was lost upon disease progression on drug. In class II,
expression of these genes was sustained and remained elevated despite progression of
disease in vivo. This dichotomy was supported by immunoblotting for p21, which remained
at high levels in a subset of PDXs at the SUR timepoint (Figure 4F).

Discussion
Countless previous studies, reviews, and perspectives have discussed the high rate of failure,
the long time from discovery to clinical benefit, and the massive cost of developing effective
cancer therapeutics. In order to facilitate preclinical drug studies that are more informative,
we have established a resource to support randomized PDX trials in mice. We demonstrate
that adequately powered studies in PDXs can be used to develop transcriptional, proteomic
and functional biomarkers of response and resistance while defining the efficacy of
therapeutics across genetically diverse subtypes of leukemia. Unlike most clinical trials, we
had no difficulties in capturing large numbers of specimens at each timepoint. We also
generated a large number of models with acquired in vivo resistance, a unique facet of phase
II-like trials in mice.

As we have shown, leukemias and lymphomas offer several advantages that make them
amenable to this approach. First, many subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma readily engraft
into NSG mice or similarly immunocompromised strains by tail-vein injection. Second,
bone marrow and blood specimens from patients with these diseases are easily obtained in
comparison with most solid tumors. Third, tail-vein injection results in orthotopic disease
growth, both in the bone marrow and in extramedullary sites that are commonly involved by
these diseases (e.g. skin, CNS, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract). Finally, studies of
orthotopic leukemia PDXs allow for survival or disease progression, rather than tumor
shrinkage, to be used as the primary endpoint. Previous discordances between tumor
shrinkage in preclinical models and survival in human studies suggest that tumor shrinkage
alone can be misleading (Couzin-Frankel, 2014).

It is important to note that direct and adequately powered comparisons for predictive ability
between cell lines and PDXs are lacking. This has largely resulted from the inadequate
number of available cell lines for an individual disease subtype. It remains possible that cell
lines would be equally predictive as PDXs for many therapeutics if adequate numbers of cell
lines were available. Similarly, other types of in vivo models have clear advantages over
PDXs. Insertional mutagenesis and chemical carcinogenesis models are highly diverse
within an individual mouse and across a population of tumors (Westcott et al., 2015). Both
these models and transgenic models have significant advantages over PDXs for modeling
microenvironmental and tumor-immune interactions (Aparicio et al., 2015). Not all human
tumors are easily engrafted orthotopically, which further limits the ability to study the effects
of tumor microenvironment on therapeutic response (Tabe and Konopleva, 2015). Another
clear limitation of PDXs is the bottleneck that tumor cells must navigate to engraft in
immunocompromised mice. Although leukemias and lymphomas have relatively high ‘take
rates’, certain subsets have proven completely intractable to xenografting, while others only
xenograft in a limited fraction of cases (Klco et al., 2014). This may introduce an important
bias that limits applicability of PDX studies to unselected patient populations.
As a result of these limitations, we make no claims that each individual model in PRoXe is
representative of the leukemia or lymphoma from which it was derived. Careful studies of
AML PDXs have demonstrated quite clearly that different leukemias can engraft in myriad
different ways, as assessed by the relative representation of subclones, even when injected as

biologic replicates into congenic recipients (Klco et al., 2014). Further complicating the
diversity of models are differences in recipient strain, approach to transplantation (e.g. tailvein injection, intraosseous injection, radiation of recipient mice), timing of injection (e.g.
from fresh specimens versus after freezing) and patient demographics between centers that
generate PDXs. Our intention was never to analyze the fidelity of individual models to their
starting material. Instead, we developed a resource to facilitate the pre-clinical evaluation of
therapeutics across a diversity of different malignancies. The observation that 3 different
mice engrafted with the same PDX and treated with the same agent have almost exactly the
same survival comes as little surprise, as previous studies from our groups (Ott et al., 2012;
Weigert et al., 2012; Zelenetz et al., 2015) and many others have shown that treatment of
large cohorts of mice injected with the same PDX typically results in survival curves that
“fall off a cliff”. Although these curves, in which all mice treated in the same way die within
a day or two of each other, provide robust statistical p values, they fail to inform the field
about the true activity of a therapeutic across diverse tumors.

Randomized phase II-like studies of PDXs in mice are applicable to a range of therapeutic
agents, especially those that act through cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms. These studies may
markedly reduce the time and financial expense of drug development while mitigating the
very real human cost of administering toxic and ineffective therapies to patients during the
drug development process. In our study of CGM097 across 24 different B-ALL PDXs,
several findings are noteworthy. First and foremost, the improvement in median survival far
exceeded that noted from a variety of different agents, including our studies of BRD4,
HSP90, and JAK2 inhibitors (Ott et al., 2012; Weigert et al., 2012; Zelenetz et al., 2015).
Second, this improvement was highly similar in PDXs developed from treatment-naive
samples and samples acquired from patients after treatment. Typical regimens for B-ALL
include multiple cytotoxic chemotherapies administered over the course of 2 years. Yet, if a
PDX engrafted with wild-type TP53, this prior therapy appeared to have no significant effect
on response to CGM097.

In order to foster the maximum impact from the PDX repository, we developed PRoXe as an
open source website. We are currently in negotiations with multiple different academic
centers to incorporate their PDXs into PRoXe or to develop Shiny-based web portals for
their own PRoXe sites. Incorporation of clinical-, pathologic- and PDX-level data from the
>1,000 solid tumor PDXs recently published by Gao et al. (2015) is underway. We
encourage others to consider adding their models. Limitations clearly exist in the willingness
of centers to share models, based largely on concerns over liability, hopes for financial
compensation and confidentiality-related issues germane to unfettered access. Addressing
these is an essential next step if the true value of PDXs is ever going to be realized. In
addition, academic centers are ill-suited to bear the burden of housing, expanding, archiving,
characterizing and disseminating PDXs to investigators (academic and industrial) across the
world. As a result, we are licensing a large portion of the models to the Jackson
Laboratories, which will allow for industry-scale expansion, quality control, characterization
and distribution, much as Addgene has provided this service for DNA plasmids.

Experimental Procedures
Generation and Use of PDXs
Primary bone marrow and blood specimens were collected from patients with leukemia and
lymphoma at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Boston
Children’s Hospital. We also imported and transplanted primary leukemia and lymphoma
specimens from 8 additional centers as well as 72 total PDXs that were already established
by participating investigators. De-identified patient samples were obtained with informed
consent and xenografted under Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board (IRB)-approved protocols #13-351, Nod.Cg-PrkdcSCIDIL2Rγ<tm1Wjl>/SzJ (NSG)
mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and handled according to
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocol #13-034.

Hemoseq
Targeted exon capture and next-generation sequencing of all coding exons of 205 genes
(Table S1) were performed as previously described (Odejide et al., 2014). A total of 115
PDX models, 45 of which had matched patient germline tissue available, were genotyped.
Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (InDels) identified using
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, Broad Institute) and curated as likely pathologic
mutations were individually visualized with the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV, Broad
Institute) to ensure biphasic and heterogeneous read distribution. The final set of curated
mutations is shown in Table S2 (provided as a separate excel file).
RNASeq

Author Manuscript

Messenger RNA was extracted from PDX leukemia or lymphoma cells using magnetic
microbeads (μMACS mRNA Isolation Kit, Mitenyi Biotec). Non-stranded RNASeq libraries
were generated using the True-SeqRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) on a Sciclone platform
(Perkin Elmer). mRNA underwent fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, and next generation
library synthesis via end repair, adenylation, adapter ligation and PCR amplification.
Libraries were sequenced on a Next-Seq instrument (Illumina) using a paired-end protocol.
CGM097 Study

Author Manuscript

Viably frozen B-ALL xenograft cells were thawed and changed into 1X PBS before tail-vein
injection at 0.5–2.0×106 per mouse. Engraftment was monitored every 7 days, starting 3
weeks post-injection, by flow cytometry of 50 μl of peripheral blood. Blood was processed
with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Qiagen) before staining with antibodies against human
CD45 (APC-conjugated, eBioscience 17-0459-42) and human CD19 (PE-conjugated
eBioscience 12-0193-82) in 1XPBS with 2mM EDTA to assess engraftment. Flow
cytometry data was analyzed with FlowJo. When engraftment was determined to be ≥ 2% of
the live cell population, the remaining two animals with the same PDX were bled for
analysis before starting treatment. Animals were dosed daily with 100 mg/kg CGM097 or
methylcellulose vehicle by oral gavage. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was conducted using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).

26 hour treated splenocytes were harvested by mechanical disruption followed by Red Blood
Cell lysis (Qiagen) and depletion of mouse cells by magnetic bead enrichment (Millitenyi).
Cells were divided into 1–5×106/cell aliquots and snap frozen for further analysis. Frozen
cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1ml Trizol® (Life Technologies) and
extracted using a modified RNeasy Kit® (Qiagen) extraction procedure, before aliquoting
and snap freezing. Cell lysate was prepared for western blotting by lysing with RIPA lysis
buffer (Westnet), followed by separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane.
Blots were probed with antibodies against p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21
(DCS60, Cell Signaling Technologies) and β-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling Technologies).
Dynamic BH3 profiling is a technique used to quantify the ability of a therapeutic agent to
promote apoptosis. Dynamic BH3 profiling was performed as previously described
(Montero et al., 2015). Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed using Pearson
correlation with average link clustering. Differential expression between experimental
criteria was determined using raw counts and normalization procedures within the DEseq
package in R based on a negative binomial distribution. The FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg)
method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons after filtering for those with ≥1.2 fold
change. Both unsupervised and supervised clustering were performed using GenePattern.
Additional details are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Significance
Preclinical drug development of cancer therapeutics largely depends on in vitro and
transgenic models that have significant limitations. We have generated a large, publically
available repository of patient-derived xenografts of leukemias and lymphomas that we
call the Public Repository of Xenografts (ProXe). This repository will enable
investigators in both academic and industrial laboratories to conduct therapeutic testing in
orthotopically engrafted patient-derived samples of diverse hematologic malignancies,
including diseases for which there are no currently available models. The size of this
repository also enables drug testing on a scale comparable to human clinical trials. Using
this repository, we demonstrate that the MDM2 inhibitor CGM097 has potent activity
against patient-derived B-ALL xenografts established from patients with both untreated
and relapsed/refractory disease.

Figure 1. Integrative analysis of leukemia and lymphoma PDXs

(A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering over expression of 1000 genes with the greatest
variance-to-mean ratios among 107 PDXs representing all WHO diagnostic categories
encompassed by our repository. (B) Key clinical characteristics of patients and their tumors
from which PDXs were derived. Patient age in years reflects the time when the xenografted
tumor specimen was obtained. Phases of treatment are defined as: Untreated, prior to
