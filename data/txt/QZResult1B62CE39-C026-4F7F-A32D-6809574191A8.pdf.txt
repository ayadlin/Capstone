ABSTRACT
Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment are known for their
ability to either inhibit or promote cancer progression. Here we evaluated the role
of Interleukin-31 (IL31), a protein belonging to the pro-inflammatory IL-6 cytokine
family which has been characterized in autoimmune disease, in tumorigenesis. We
show that IL31 and its receptor, IL31RA, are highly expressed in various human and
mouse cancer cell lines, as well as in tumor specimens from cancer patients. MC38
murine colon carcinoma cells depleted of IL31 exhibit an increase in invasive and
migratory properties in vitro, effects that are reversed by supplementing the cells
with exogenous IL31. In vivo, IL31-depleted MC38 tumor cells implanted to mice
grow faster than control tumors. In contrast, MC38 tumor-bearing mice infused with
recombinant IL31, exhibit a significant reduction in tumor growth than control mice.
Furthermore, IL31 infusion reduces the number of metastatic lesions in the lungs
of mice bearing 4T1 murine metastatic breast carcinoma. Lastly, injecting tumorbearing, chemotherapy-treated mice with a long-lived IL31-IgG fusion protein reduces
tumor growth, angiogenesis and pulmonary metastasis to a greater extent than when
chemotherapy is used alone. The IL31 anti-tumor activity is explained, in part, by
the anti-angiogenic effects demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the
potential use of IL31 as an anti-cancer drug.

INTRODUCTION

outcome, and delays recurrence [6–8]. These host cellular
effects are accompanied by a substantial upregulation
of growth factors, enzymes, chemokines and cytokines
[7, 9, 10]. For example, it has been demonstrated that
following paclitaxel (PTX), 5FU and gemcitabine
chemotherapies, IL1-β, an upstream cytokine known to
initiate the pro-inflammatory cascade, is highly expressed
in various organs. IL1-β activates immune cells such as
macrophages at the treated tumor site, therefore supporting
tumor regrowth and metastasis [11, 12]. Furthermore,
we also found that VEGF-C, a molecule promoting
lymphangiogenesis in tumors, is substantially upregulated
in the plasma and organs of mice treated with PTX
chemotherapy [13]. Specifically, naïve mice implanted
with cultured tumor cells together with macrophages
obtained from PTX-treated mice exhibited increased tumor

One of the main obstacles in clinical oncology is
the development of resistance to therapy leading to tumor
re-growth and even spread. There are several mechanisms
underlying tumor resistance. For example, selection of
tumor cells bearing genomic mutations leads to acquired
resistance. In addition, accessory cells within the tumor
microenvironment can protect cancer cells from the drug
cytotoxic effects [1–3]. We and others have demonstrated
that several types of bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs)
including endothelial progenitor cells or Tie-2 expressing
monocytes home to chemotherapy-treated tumors, leading
to increased angiogenesis and subsequent tumor regrowth
[4–6]. Blocking the colonization or function of these
host cells using antiangiogenic drugs improves therapy

lymphangiogenesis, in a similar manner to tumor-bearing
mice treated with PTX [13]. These collective studies
demonstrate that the host response to chemotherapy results
in a substantial increase in various BMDCs and factors
that affect the tumor microenvironment and negate the
drug anti-tumor activity [1].
We therefore undertook a proteomic approach to
screen for additional cytokines and growth factors that
are induced in the plasma of mice after chemotherapy,
with the aim of identifying those that affect the tumor
microenvironment. In this screen, non-tumor bearing mice
were treated with various chemotherapy drugs. We found
that Interleukin-31 (IL31), a protein belonging to the proinflammatory IL-6 cytokine family, was upregulated in the
plasma and bone marrow cells following PTX and FOLFOX
chemotherapy, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). IL31
is an immunoregulatory cytokine that is mainly produced
by activated T helper (CD4) and cytotoxic T (CD8) cells,
and is elevated in atopic dermatitis [14, 15]. IL31 acts
through the heterodimer receptors of IL31 (IL31RA) and
oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) that are expressed on
activated monocytes and unstimulated epithelial cells [16].
A recent study demonstrated that IL31 is highly effective
in suppressing the proliferation of lung epithelial cells by
upregulating several signaling pathways [18]. The blockade
of IL31 has been shown to reduce dermatitis in mice and
human [14, 18].
There is only limited evidence for the involvement
of IL31 in cancer. Clinically, it has been shown that IL31
correlates with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progression [19].
Furthermore, a recent study indicated that IL31 decreased
the proliferation of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, a
process dependent on cultured cell density [20]. However,
the contribution of IL31 to tumor progression or metastasis
is still elusive.
In this study we investigated the role of IL31 in
cancer progression focusing on processes other than
immunomodulation. We found that IL31 and IL31RA are
expressed by several types of tumor cells from both mouse
and human origins. Mice infused with IL31 exhibited tumor
growth retardation and reduced number of pulmonary
metastatic lesions. These effects are attributed at least in
part to the direct anti-angiogenic role of IL31. Overall, our
results demonstrate the potential use of IL31 as a novel
antiangiogenic drug for the treatment of cancer.

and protein levels of IL31 and IL31RA were evaluated in
cell lysates derived from myeloma, leukemia, melanoma,
glioblastoma, and several carcinoma cell lines of both
mouse and human origins. Of note, the reason for using cell
lysates and/or mRNA levels and not conditioned medium
extracted from such cells is due to the lack of sensitive
antibodies for the detection of IL31 by Western blot,
especially for human IL31. The results in Figure 1A–1B
demonstrate that the different cell lines express IL31 and
IL31RA to various degrees. Specifically, high expression
of IL31 was found in 4/9 murine and 5/7 human cell lines.
Tissue microarray analysis of human tumors revealed that
a high proportion of tumor specimens express IL31RA in
all the tested tumor types (Figure 1C). High expression
of IL31RA was also found in 10/15 and 12/15 breast and
colon carcinoma specimens, respectively (Figure 1D). It
should be noted that the majority of tumor cells express the
Oncostatin M Receptor, as indicated by the online human
protein atlas [21]. Overall these results indicate that certain
tumor types highly express IL31 and/or IL31RA, and thus
suggest a potential role for the IL31-IL31RA axis in cancer.

IL31 inhibits cell migration and invasion
To investigate the possible role of IL31 in tumor
cells, we silenced IL31 expression in MC38 murine colon
carcinoma cells that highly express IL31 (Figure 1A) using
siRNA (siIL31). A selected siIL31 MC38 clone showed
a 50% decrease in IL31 expression levels when compared
to control cells stably-transfected with scrambled siRNA
(Figure 2A). Next, control and siIL31 MC38 cells were
assessed for cell invasion and migration properties. The
siIL31 MC38 cells exhibited a significant increase in cell
invasion and migration properties in comparison to control
(Figure 2B–2C). Consistently, culturing wt-MC38 cells in the
presence of IL31 (100ng/ml) reduced invasion and migration
properties in comparison to untreated cells (Figure 2D–2E).

IL31 does not affect tumor cell viability,
proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis
IL31RA activation involves the MAPK and
PI3K signaling pathways and STAT3/5 transcription
factors [17, 22]. These signaling cascades contribute
to several cell processes including cell proliferation,
apoptosis, differentiation and inflammation [23]. Since
IL31RA is expressed by several tumor types, we studied
whether its activation by IL31 affects the above-mentioned
cellular processes. We chose to work with MC38 and
CT-26 colon carcinoma cells that highly express both
IL31 and IL31RA (Figure 1A). The cells were cultured
in the presence of escalating doses of rmIL31, and were
evaluated for cell viability by the AlamarBlue assay,
proliferation by BrdU assay, as well as cell cycle and
apoptosis by flow cytometry as described in Materials
and Methods. There were no significant differences in cell

RESULTS
Expression of IL31 and/or IL31RA in cancer cell
lines and human tumor specimens
The expression pattern of IL31 and its receptors in
various normal tissues from both murine and human origins
has been described previously [14]. Here, we investigated
the expression of IL31 and its receptor (IL31RA) in various
cancer cell lines and human tumor specimens. The mRNA

viability, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis at any of
the rmIL31 concentrations tested, up to a dose of 100 ng/ml
(Supplementary Figure 2 and data not shown).

Next, we assessed the changes in tumor growth in
mice administered with recombinant murine IL31 (rmIL31).
Since IL31 is a small cytokine of ~24 kDa in size, we used
subcutaneous micro-osmotic pumps to infuse rmIL31
protein at a dose of 0.7 μg/day for 2 weeks. A complete
inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice infused
with rmIL31 compared to control mice infused with
vehicle (Figure 3D). The number of microvessels and the
percentage of endothelial cells were decreased in tumors
harvested from the IL31-treated mice, as assessed by CD31
staining and flow cytometry, respectively. Notably, a larger
vessel phenotype was observed in tumors from IL31-treated
mice (Figure 3E–3F). Collectively, these results suggest that
continuous infusion of IL31 inhibits tumor growth, partly by
an anti-angiogenic activity.

IL31 inhibits tumor growth in vivo in part by an
anti-angiogenic effect
To assess the effect of IL31 on tumor growth
in vivo, control or siIL31 MC38 cells were implanted into
C57Bl/6 mice and tumor growth was monitored regularly.
Tumors from mice implanted with MC38 siIL31 cells
grew significantly faster than control tumors (using
scrambled siRNA). (Figure 3A). At end point, tumors
were harvested, and cryosections were analyzed for
microvessel density (MVD) using CD31 as an endothelial
cell marker. In addition, harvested tumors were also
prepared as single cell suspensions for the evaluation
of endothelial cell percentage by flow cytometry. The
number of microvessels and the percentage of endothelial
cells were significantly higher in siIL31 MC38 tumors in
comparison to control tumors (Figure 3B–3C).

IL31 inhibits metastatic spread
Angiogenesis has a potent effect on metastasis [24].
In light of our findings demonstrating that IL31 has an
antiangiogenic effect, we next evaluated whether IL31

inhibits metastasis. To this end, we used the highly
metastatic 4T1 murine breast carcinoma cell line which
generates spontaneous pulmonary metastasis [25]. The
4T1 cell line highly expresses IL31RA, but not IL31
(Figure 1A). 4T1 cells were implanted to the mammary fat
pad of BALB/c mice. After 3 days, mice were implanted
with micro-osmotic pumps and infused with rmIL31
(0.7 μg/day for 2 weeks). Tumor growth, percentage of
endothelial cells and MVD in tumors were significantly
reduced in mice infused with IL31 compared to control
mice (Figure 4A–4C), similar to our findings with MC38
tumors. In addition, a significant decrease in the number of

micrometastases was observed in the lungs of mice infused
with IL31 compared to control mice (Figure 4D). These
results demonstrate that IL31 inhibits both angiogenesis
and pulmonary metastasis.

IL31 directly inhibits endothelial cell tube
formation
We next asked whether IL31 directly affects
endothelial cell activity. We first examined the expression
of IL31RA on endothelial cells and found that human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indeed express

IL31RA (Figure 5A). Next we performed a HUVEC tube
forming assay in the presence of rhIL31 or PBS control. IL31
significantly delayed the formation of tubes, as demonstrated
by a significant reduction in the number of bifurcations,
nodes, segmentations and junctions in the presence of IL31
compared to control (Figure 5B). These results suggest that
IL31 directly inhibits HUVEC tube forming activity.

Small proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines,
have a short half-life in peripheral blood circulation,
usually in the range of several minutes [26, 27] such that
their use as therapeutic agents is not feasible in a clinical

setting. To increase the stability of IL31, we designed a
construct encoding IL31 fused to the CH2-CH3 domain
of the IgG backbone. This fusion presumably increases
the half-life of the protein as previously shown for other
molecules [28, 29]. HEK-293T cells were transfected
with the human IL31-IgG expression plasmid and stable
transfectants were selected. Expression of the fusion
protein was detected in cell lysates by Western blot
analysis using appropriate antibodies (Supplementary
Figure 3A–3B). For purification of IL31-IgG, the cells
were serum-starved for 72 hours and conditioned medium
was run on nickel-bead columns.
To evaluate the stability of the purified IL31-IgG
protein in peripheral blood, C57/Bl6 mice were injected
with protein mixture containing 200 µg of the recombinant
human IL31-IgG protein together with 30 μg of a

recombinant human IL31 protein tagged with His. Blood
was drawn from the retro-orbital sinus at different time
points and plasma was separated. The IL31 proteins were
detected by Western blot analysis using anti-His HRP
conjugated antibody. While the recombinant IL31 was no
longer detected 15 min after injection, the IL31-IgG fusion
protein remained in the circulation for at least 72 hours
(Supplementary Figure 3C).
We next verified that the purified IL31-IgG protein
is functionally active by testing its ability to activate the
STAT3 pathway. To do this, U87 human glioblastoma cells
expressing IL31RA (Figure 1B) were transfected with a
STAT3 luciferase reporter plasmid. Cells were then serum
starved for 16 hours followed by a 6 hour incubation
with IL31-IgG or rhIL31 proteins. Both proteins
significantly activated the STAT3 pathway, although a

higher concentration of IL31-IgG was required to achieve
a comparable level of activation to that found with
rhIL31 (Supplementary Figure 3D). Overall, these results
demonstrate that the IL31-IgG fusion protein is functionally
active and is stable in the circulation for at least 72 hours.

decreased in tumors of IL31-IgG-treated mice (Figure 6B).
However, vessel structure was not markedly changed in
contrast to results shown in Figure 3E.
It should be noted that the human IL31-IgG does not
cross react with IL31RA found in the mouse endothelial cells,
due to only ~30% homology between human and mouse
IL31 [14] and data not shown. Therefore, it is plausible that
IL31 inhibits endothelial cells indirectly by inducing the
secretion of antiangiogenic mediators from human tumor
cells. To test this possibility, HCT116 colon carcinoma
cells that had been previously cultured in the presence of
rhIL31 were subsequently cultured in serum-free medium
to generate conditioned medium (CM). Then, HUVECs
were exposed to CM in order to evaluate endothelial
cell activity. The CM from cells pre-treated with rhIL31
reduced tube formation in comparison to the corresponding
control demonstrating an indirect effect of human IL31 on
mouse endothelial cell activity (Figure 6C, middle panels).
In addition, supplementing IL31 to CM from cells pretreated with control IgG similarly reduced tube formation
(Figure 6C, right panels) in accordance with results shown

IL31-IgG inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis
and metastasis
We next investigated the effect of IL31-IgG in human
models of cancer using NOD-SCID mice. These mice are
deficient of innate and adaptive immune cell components
and therefore any potential immunomodulation effects of
the IL31-IgG protein can be ruled out in this system [30].
HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells were subcutaneously
implanted into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice. When tumors
reached 100 mm3, mice were intraperitoneally injected with
IL31-IgG twice weekly, and tumor growth was assessed
over time. A significant inhibition of tumor growth was
found in IL31-IgG-treated mice compared to control IgGtreated mice (Figure 6A). In addition, MVD count was

in Figure 5. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that IL31
inhibits endothelial cell activity both directly (Figure 5)
and indirectly probably through antiangiogenic mediators
secreted by tumor cells (Figure 6C).
Lastly, we evaluated the effect of IL31-IgG on
metastasis in a clinically relevant breast carcinoma model. In

this case, IL31 was used as an ‘add-on’ drug in combination
with standard chemotherapy. It has been shown that
angiogenesis is induced between successive chemotherapy
treatments and therefore the addition of an antiangiogenic
drug may increase the efficacy of chemotherapy [8, 31].
Clinically, antibody-based antiangiogenic drugs are

were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice (n = 5 mice/group). When tumors reached a size of 100 mm3, mice were

usually administered in combination with chemotherapy
as they have little effect as single agents [32]. To test this
treatment protocol in our preclinical model, LM2-4 human
breast carcinoma cells were orthotopically implanted into
the mammary fat pad of NOD-SCID mice. When tumors
reached 50 mm3, treatment with PTX chemotherapy
administered at the maximum tolerated dose (25 mg/kg) was
initiated with or without IL31-IgG injections administered
twice weekly. The combined therapy exhibited a superior
anti-tumor activity in comparison to PTX monotherapy
(Figure 7A). At end point, tumors and lungs were removed.
Tumors from mice treated with the combination therapy
exhibited a significant reduction in MVD in comparison to
tumors from untreated and PTX-treated mice (Figure 7B).
In addition, the number of pulmonary micrometastases was
significantly reduced in mice treated with PTX and IL31
when compared to PTX monotherapy or control (Figure 7C).
It should be noted that no signs of toxicity was observed as
assessed by changes in body weight in this model as well as
the model presented in Figure 3D (Supplementary Figure 4).

Collectively, these results suggest that IL31 has a superior
therapeutic activity when administered as an ‘add on’ drug
in combination with chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
The tumor microenvironment is composed of
malignant and host cells that interact via an extended
network of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and
matrix remodeling enzymes [33, 34]. Such cells and
factors are known to mainly promote but sometimes
restrict tumor growth [3]. Recent studies have emphasized
that following therapy, dramatic changes occur in the
tumor microenvironment that may contribute to tumor regrowth and metastasis [1]. In this study we focused on the
pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL31, which we previously
found to be induced in response to chemotherapy. We
found that IL31 and its receptor IL31RA are differentially
expressed by various tumor types from both human and
mouse origins. While IL31 has been shown to contribute

to various inflammatory diseases such as dermatitis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and airway hypersensitivity
[35], in cancer, its role is still unknown. Importantly, while
there is no clear correlation between autoimmune disease
such as dermatitis and overall cancer incidence, based on
Kaplan-Meier plotter for breast cancer patients, we found
that there is a significant extended survival to breast cancer
patients with high expression of IL31RA when compared to
patients with low expression of IL31RA [36]. In addition,
IL31 is highly expressed in hematological malignancies
such as follicular lymphoma, germinal cancer derived
B-cell malignancy, and T cell lymphoma, and was found to
contribute to tumor growth via the STAT1/STAT3 signaling
pathway [37]. On this note, unlike solid tumors in which
pro-inflammation at the time of tumor progression usually
restrict tumor growth [38], in hematological malignancies
pro-inflammation promotes tumor growth as recently
reported for multiple myeloma [39]. In this study, however,
we focused on the non-immunological effects of IL31 on
growth and metastasis of solid tumors.
We show that MC38 cells depleted of IL-31 exhibit
an increase in invasive and migratory properties in vitro,
effects that are reversed by supplementing the cells with
exogenous IL-31. In vivo, the number of metastatic lesions
in the lungs of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice is reduced when
the mice are infused with IL31, in agreement with our
in vitro findings. These anti-metastatic effects can be
explained by the anti-angiogenic effects of IL31 and by
the decreased invasion and migration properties of tumor
cells in the presence of IL31. We also show that endothelial
cells cultured in the presence of IL31 exhibit limited tube
forming capability, including a reduction in the number
of bifurcations, segments and nodes. Taken together, it
is plausible that IL31 inhibits cell motility. Indeed, the
effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell motility
and metastatic properties has already been reported. For
example IL-1β induces the expression of metalloproteinase
such as MMP9, and thus contributes to cell invasion [40].
TNFα and IFNγ have also been shown to promote motility
of neural precursors [41]. It is plausible that IL31, like other
pro-inflammatory cytokines, alters tumor cell activity by
inhibiting cell motility rather than increasing it, explaining
its inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and metastasis.
Tumor growth is highly dependent on
angiogenesis [42]. Antiangiogenic therapy is a standard
treatment for various malignancies, including colon,
ovarian, non-small cell lung and glioblastoma tumors,
among others [32]. Here we demonstrate that tumors from
mice infused with IL31 exhibit reduced angiogenesis when
compared to control untreated mice in both syngeneic
murine tumors and human tumor xenografts implanted in
NOD-SCID mice. Furthermore, HUVEC tube formation is
inhibited in the presence of IL31 or CM of cells pre-treated
with IL31, demonstrating both direct and indirect inhibition
of endothelial cell activity, respectively. It is possible that
IL31 induces the secretion of additional cytokines and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factors as recently summarized in [35], which in turn
inhibit the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors by tumor
cells. In contrast, a recent study demonstrated that IL31
in conjunction with IL-4 induces the expression of VEGF
and EGF in bronchial epithelial cells thereby supporting
bronchial inflammation [43]; however, its direct angiogenic
role and the relevant factors that are upregulated in
response to IL31 activated signaling pathways have not
been elucidated in carcinomas. Collectively, while the
antiangiogenic activity of IL31 has been demonstrated
in vitro and in vivo, it remains to evaluate whether IL31
affects also subsets of endothelial cells, e.g., tumor
associated endothelium, therefore explaining its potent
antiangiogenic activity in vivo.
To test the potential therapeutic effect of IL-31
in human-relevance cancers, we used IL-31-IgG fused
protein with extended half-life and demonstrate its
therapeutic potential in vivo when used in combination
with chemotherapy. The rationale for using a combinatorial
approach is based on previous reports indicating that
chemotherapy and other cytotoxic-like agents stimulate
neoangiogenesis ultimately leading to therapy resistance
and tumor re-growth [7, 44]. Accordingly, the addition of an
anti-angiogenic drug in between successive chemotherapy
treatments blocks the rapid neoangiogenesis process,
enhancing therapy outcome [8, 45]. In this study we
show that injecting tumor-bearing, chemotherapy-treated
mice with IL31-IgG reduces tumor growth, angiogenesis
and pulmonary metastases to a greater extent than when
chemotherapy is used alone. We also found that treated
mice did not exhibit toxic side effects such as dermatitis
often found with overexpression of IL31 [18] and there
were no changes in body weight during the therapy. These
findings highlight the potential use of IL31 as an anticancer drug. We should note that the use of NOD-SCID
mice, which are deficient of immune cells, allowed us to
rule out the cancer associated inflammation that may take
place following IL31 therapy inflammation.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the antitumorigenic effect of IL31 that is mediated by inhibition
of angiogenesis and metastasis. However, additional
studies are required to assess the pro-inflammatory
and immunomodulatory effects of IL31 in the tumor
microenvironment, and whether such activities affect
tumorigenesis.

lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, Israel) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS, Biological Industries, Israel), 1%
L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% streptomycinpenicillin-neomycin solution (Biological Industries).
MC38 was kindly provided by Prof. Ron Apte (Ben Gurion
university, Israel), and all other indicated cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA) and were used within 6 months of cell
resuscitation. 4T1 murine breast carcinoma, CT-26 murine
colon carcinoma, P3 and MPC-11 murine myelomas, LM24 human breast carcinoma, and Jurkat human acute T-cell
leukemia cell lines, all from ATCC, were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented as above.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured
in M199 medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with
20% FCS , 2 mM glutamine, 1% streptomycin, penicillin
and neomycin, MEM vitamins (1:100), and bFGF (5 ng/ml,
Biological Industries). All cells were cultured at 37oC in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

(1:5000, MP Biomedicals) or GAPDH (1: 500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.) were used to verify equal loading.
Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Biological Industries).

mRNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
mRNA was purified from the various human cell lines
using High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics,
Manheim, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol. mRNA was quantified by measuring Ab260 nm
with a Nano Drop spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Nano
Drop Technologies, Rockland, DE, USA). cDNA was then
synthesized from the mRNA samples (100–1000 ng of mRNA
in a 20 μl total reaction mix) using a high capacity cDNA
reverse transcription kit (iScriptTMcDNA Synthesis Kit, BioRad Laboratories Inc.). Real-time PCR for human IL31 was
performed using Rotor-Gene 6000TM (Corbett) equipment
with iTaqTM universal probes supermix (iTaqTMUniversal
Probes Supermix, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) using hIL31
probe (#Hs01098710_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.). Values were normalized to HPRT (hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase) (#Hs02800695_m1, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) expression levels. Calculations of
Taqman-analyzed transcripts were presented by semiquantitative PCR.

Tumor models
MC38 (1 × 106) or HCT116 (2 × 106) cells were
subcutaneously injected into the ﬂanks of 6-week-old
female C57Bl/6 or non-obese diabetic severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice (Harlan, Israel),
respectively. 4T1 (5 × 105) and LM2-4 (2 × 106) cells
were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad
of 6–8 week-old female BALB/c or NOD-SCID female
mice (Harlan, Israel), respectively. Tumor size was
assessed regularly with Vernier calipers using the formula
width2 × length × 0.5. All animal studies were performed
in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.

Downregulation of IL31 by siRNA
Four different siRNA sequences speciﬁc to murine
IL31 or a scrambled control sequence were cloned into
the piLenti-siRNA-GFP plasmid (Applied Biological
Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada). Subconfluent MC38
cells were transfected with the siRNA plasmids using
FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent (Roche, Penzberg,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were incubated
in growth medium containing puromycin (1 µl/ml) for the
selection of stable transfectants. After 2 weeks of selection,
the protein level of IL31 was evaluated by Western blot.

Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot
analysis
Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES
pH 7.7, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100), supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT, 20 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na2VO4, 100 μg/ml PMSF,
and protease inhibitor cocktail 1:100 (Sigma Aldrich).
Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford. Sample
buffer was then added to the cell lysates. One hundred
micrograms of protein was separated by SDS/PAGE.
Subsequently, the samples were electro-transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked
in 5% skim milk in TBST for 30 min followed by overnight
incubation at 40C with the following antibodies: antimouse IL31 (5 μg/ml, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-mouse
IL31RA (1:100, BIOSES) or anti-human IL31RA (5 μg/ml,
Sigma Aldrich). Actin mouse monoclonal antibody

Invasion and migration assays
The invasion and migration properties of tumor cells
were evaluated in Matrigel- or fibronectin-coated Boyden
chambers as previously described [4]. Briefly, filters (6.5 mm
in diameter, 8 µm pore size) were coated with either Matrigel
(diluted 1:4 in DMEM, BD Bioscience, USA), or 0.01 µg/µl
fibronectin (Biological Industries, Israel) for invasion or
migration assays, respectively. Freshly coated filters were
left to dry for 2 hours at 37oC. Serum-deprived siIL31 or
control MC38 cells were seeded in the upper compartment
of the chamber and the lower compartment was filled with
serum-free medium. After incubation for 24 hours at 37oC,
cells that passed through to the bottom filter were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Cells were stained with 0.5%

Crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized using Leica
DMI 6000B microscope (Leica, Wetzlar Germany). All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

BrdU ELISA kit (CycLex Co. Japan) followed by the
manufacturer’s instruction. BrdU was detected by ELISA.

Osmotic pumps

Cell viability alamar blueTM assay

Alzet micro-osmotic pumps were used to achieve
continuous administration of rmIL31 to mice for a period
of 2 weeks, as previously described [47]. Briefly, C57Bl/6
tumor-bearing mice were subcutaneously implanted with
micro-osmotic pumps (#1002, Alzet, Cupertino, CA)
loaded with rmIL31 (at a dose of 0.7 μg/day) or PBS as a
vehicle control. The procedure was performed under sterile
conditions. The mice were sacrificed 14 days after pump
implantation and further assessed as described in the text.

Cell viability was evaluated quantitatively with the
metabolic indicator dye AlamarBlueTM (Serotec Ltd., Oxford,
UK), which determines the metabolic activity of cells, as
previously described [46]. Briefly, MC38 or CT-26 cells
were harvested from sub-confluent cultures and re-plated
(500– 1,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate) in their designated
medium supplemented with 10% AlamarBlue (AB) solution.
Recombinant murine IL31 (rmIL31,PeproTech, Israel)
was added in escalating concentrations (0.5–100 ng/ml).
Absorbance was acquired daily using ELISA reader
(TECAN infinite M200Pro, Switzerland). The percent of
AB reduction was calculated using an appropriate equation.
Results were corrected to background values of negative
controls. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Flow cytometry analysis of endothelial cells
Tumor specimens were prepared as single cell
suspensions as previously described [48]. Cells from
tumor specimens were immunostained with CD45-APCCy7, CD31-APC, and VEGFR2-PE (BioLegend, San
Diego, CA). Endothelial cells were defined as CD45–/
CD31+/VEGFR2+. At least 100,000 events were collected
for each sample. The experiments were performed using
Cyan-ADP flow cytometer and analyzed by Summit
Version 4.3 software (Beckman Coulter, Switzerland).

Cell cycle assay
MC38 or CT-26 cells were cultured with 100 ng/
ml rmIL31 or vehicle control for 48 hours. Cells were
detached and re-suspended in 100 μl PBS. Cells were fixed
by slowly adding the suspension to a tube containing 1 ml
70% ethanol with gentle vortexing. Cells were incubated
on ice for 20 min, centrifuged and re-suspended in 1ml of
Propidium Iodide (PI) master mix containing 40 μg/ml
PI (BioLegend, Inc., USA), 10 μg/ml RNase (SigmaAldrich), and 950 μl PBS. After a 30 min incubation at room
temperature, samples were analyzed with a Cyan-ADP flow
cytometer and Summit Version 4.3 software (Beckman
Coulter, Switzerland) using linear scale histogram.

Tissue processing and immunostaining
Tumors and lungs were embedded in OCT and
subsequently sectioned. Lungs were stained with H&E
in order to detect metastatic lesions. Tumor sections
(10  μm) were analyzed for microvessel density (MVD)
by immunostaining using an anti-CD31 antibody (1:200,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) followed by a Cy3conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, (Jackson). Vessel
structures per field were counted and plotted. At least 5
fields per tumor, normally n > 15 fields per group, were
counted. Cancer survey tissue microarrays (TMA, OriGene
Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD USA) or tumor sections
from human breast (n = 15) and colon (n = 15) carcinoma
samples obtained from the Department of Pathology at the
Rambam Medical Center (Haifa, Israel), were immunostained
with human IL31RA antibody (1:100, Abcam) followed by
histidine peroxidase anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies (Nichirei, Japan). Staining was developed using
AEC simple stain solution (Nichirei). Hematoxylin (Sigma)
was used as a counterstain. The samples were analyzed by
a pathologist for positive staining. All human studies were
approved by the ethic committee at the Rambam Medical
Center after patients signed an informed consent.

Apoptosis assay
MC38 or CT-26 cells were cultured with 100 ng/
ml rmIL31 or vehicle control for 48 hours. The cells were
detached and re-suspended in 60 μl Annexin V Binding
Buffer (MBL, Japan). Subsequently, 2.5 μl of Annexin
V-FITC antibody (Bio Legend, Inc., USA) and 2.5 μl of
7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
were added and samples were incubated for 15 min at RT
in the dark. Annexin V Binding Buffer (300 μl) was then
added to each sample. Samples were analyzed with a CyanADP flow cytometer and Summit Version 4.3 software
(Beckman Coulter, Switzerland).

BrdU assay

Tube forming assay

MC38 or CT-26 cells were cultured with rmIL31
(100 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 48 hours. Subsequently they
were incubated for 2 hours with 11 μM bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) labeling reagent (MBL) using CycLex Cellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HUVECs (4 × 105) were seeded in 48 well plates precoated with 150 μl of Matrigel. The cells were incubated
for 24 hours with serum-free DMEM supplemented with
16441

Oncotarget

Pharmacokinetic analysis of the IL31-IgG fusion
protein

100 ng/ml rhIL31 or PBS control. In a different experiment,
HCT116 cells were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml
rhIL31 or PBS control. After 24 hours, the cells were
rinsed with PBS and fresh serum-free medium was added.
Conditioned medium (CM) was collected 24 hours later
for use in the tube forming assay. HUVECs were incubated
for 24 hours with serum-free DMEM supplemented
with CM. The formation of microtubes by the HUVECs
was monitored using time-lapse microscopy (Zeiss Axio
observer system). The number of bifurcations, nodes,
segments and junctions were counted per field (n > 5 fields/
group), using computer image analysis (ImageJ, NIH). The
experiments were performed in triplicate.

C57Bl/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with
a mixture of 30 μg of hrIL31 and 200μg of hIL31-IgG.
Blood was drawn from the retro-orbital sinus at baseline
and after 0.25, 1, 6, 24, 72 and 144 hours. The blood
samples were centrifuged (3000 × g, 15 min) to separate
plasma. Plasma samples (2 μl/lane) were resolved by SDS/
PAGE gel, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of IL31 and
IL31-IgG using anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Jacksons), antimyc (1:500, Santa Cruz), and anti-His mAb-HRP-DirecT
(1:3000, MBL). Plasma immunoglobulin, which served as
a loading control, was detected using anti-mouse IgG light
chain (1:10,000, Jackson).

Human IL31-IgG construct generation
The DNA sequence of mature human IL31 protein
with its signal peptide for secretion was synthesized
based on gBlocks Gene Fragment technology from
IDT, and inserted into the NSPI expression vector
(kindly provided by Prof. Gera Neufeld, Technion,
Israel). Mouse IgG1 heavy chain (hinge-CH2-CH3)
was cloned downstream to human IL31 and upstream
to myc-His6. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from
mouse spleen using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Singlestranded cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, WI) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Mouse IgG1 heavy chain (hinge-CH2-CH3)
was amplified using PCR. The primers used were: sense
(5- TACCGCTCGAGGTGCCCAGGGATTGTGGTTG-3)
and antisense (5ʹ-CGTTCGAATTTACCAGGAGAG
TGGG -3).The NSPI-IL31–mIgG–myc-His construct was
checked by restriction mapping and sequencing.

Luciferase reporter assay
U87 cells, highly expressing IL31RA, were
transfected with a STAT3-luciferase reporter plasmid
(kindly provided by Prof. Jian Jian Li, as previously
described [50]) using lipofectamine reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA). Subsequently, cells were serumstarved for 16 hours, and then cells were either left
untreated or treated with hrIL31 (50 ng/ml), IL31-IgG
(5 µg/ml) or IgG (5 µg/ml) for an additional 6 hours.
Cells were harvested, centrifuged and washed with PBS.
The pellet was re-suspended in lysis buffer (Passive lysis
buffer, Promega), and lysed by instant freeze/thaw cycles.
Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were tested for
luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay kit (DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bioluminescence
was quantified using the TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner
Designs, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Affinity chromatography
HEK-293T human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC)
were transfected with the NSPI-IL31–mIgG–myc-His
plasmid using the calcium phosphate method [49]. After
48 hours, the cells were cultured in growth medium
supplemented with puromycin (1 µl/ml) to select for stable
transfectants (HEK-293T-IL31). Expression of the fusion
protein was verified by Western blot, as described below.
For purification of the IL31-IgG fusion protein, HEK-293TIL31 cells were serum starved for 72 hours. Conditioned
medium was then collected and run on a HisTrap affinity
column (GE Healthcare, Sweden) using the AKTA start
protein purification system (GE Healthcare, Sweden).
Imidazole (0.25 M) was used to elute the IL31-IgG protein.
The purified protein sample was run on a buffer exchange
column (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) to exchange
imidazole buffer for PBS. Glycerol was added to the protein
sample to a final concentration of 10%, and aliquots were
stored at –20°C until further use. IL31-IgG fusion protein
product was tested to be endotoxin-free using endotoxin
detection kit (Endozyme, Hyglos, Germany).

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Statistically significant differences were determined
by two-tailed Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA, followed
by Tukey ad hoc statistical post-test using Prism 5 software
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Differences between all groups
were compared with each other or to control (in the case of
Student’s t-test), and were considered significant at values
of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
