ABSTRACT
Naptumomab estafenatox/ABR-217620/ANYARA (Nap) has been evaluated in
clinical phase 1 and 2/3 studies. RCC patients in the phase 2/3 trial were randomized
1:1 in an open label study to receive Nap+IFN-α or IFN-α. In this study, we analyzed
the UK patients for their immunological response in relation to prolonged overall
survival (OS). We found that Nap-specific T cells were reduced after 3 treatment days
in patients’ peripheral blood. Levels of both Nap-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
significantly higher 8 days after the first treatment. Patients with such pattern of
reduction and expansion of Nap-binding T cells also showed increased levels of IL-2
and IFN-γ in plasma 3 hours after the first Nap treatment. In addition, Nap caused an
increase of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. The patients in the UK subset showed a tendency
of OS benefit after Nap treatment. Most Nap treated patients with long OS had low
baseline IL-6 and normal levels of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies. Furthermore, patients
with pronounced Nap induced IL-2 and T cell expansion had long OS. In conclusion,
patients with low baseline IL-6 and normal anti-SEA/E-120 may respond well to Nap
by T cell activation and expansion paving the way for anti-tumour effects.

a targeted approach to eradicate tumour cells [2]. Tumour
targeted superantigens (TTS) are recombinant fusion
proteins that consist of an anti-tumour Fab moiety genetically
fused to a superantigen [3, 4]. TTS treat tumours via the
local activation of the patient’s cytotoxic T cells through a
process termed Superantigen Antibody Dependent Cellular
Cytotoxicity (SADCC) [5]. Using this approach, 5T4
tumour-associated antigen was targeted by genetically fusing
murine Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 5T4 to a
mutated superanti­gen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA),
and maximum tolerated dose and safety established in a trial
in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients [6]. A
phase II study of RCC patients receiving at least two four-day
cycles of doses of anatumomab mafenatox (ABR-214936)
treatment approximately one month apart was completed.

INTRODUCTION
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2–3%
of all new cancer cases [1]. The clear cell RCC is the
most common subtype and accounts for 70–80% of
all renal cancers. Although RCC is resistant to classic
chemotherapy, development of new therapies including
tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved the median
survival period of patients with advanced RCC to about 26
months. Improvement of therapy of RCC by introducing
new concepts is still urgent though [1]. Immunotherapy
is well on the way to becoming an established tool in
the cancer treatment armory and RCC is regarded as a
sensitive tumour type.

Centre (MSKCC) prognostic criteria, a prolonged survival
compared to published expectation was observed. The group
of patients receiving the highest drug exposure lived almost
twice as long as expected, while the low dose group lived as
expected from their MSKCC risk scores [7]. The increase in
circulating interleukin (IL)-2 levels after treatment provides
a useful biomarker for clinical effect since patients with
the highest increase in IL-2 at the second treatment day
lived significantly longer [7]. The next generation of drug,
Naptumomab estafenatox/ABR-217620/ANYARA (Nap),
was then developed. Nap, as anatumomab mafenatox,
contains the 5T4 antibody but uses the mutated SEE
SEA/E-120 superantigen [8]. The 5T4 antibody recognizes
an oncofoetal antigen, a transmembrane glycoprotein which
is expressed by different cancers; it is expressed at high levels
in 95% of RCC [9]. Restricted expression of 5T4 on tumour
tissues as well as its association with tumour progression and
poor prognosis has driven the development of 5T4 vaccineand antibody targeted immunotherapies [10]. The fusion
protein 5T4 antibody moiety has an affinity in the order of
1 nM. Nap induces T cell mediated killing of tumour cells,
SADCC, at concentrations around 10 pM and the SEA/E-120
superantigen moiety has been engineered to have low binding
to human antibodies and MHC class II [8, 11].
After phase 1 studies [12] a prospective, randomized
phase 2/3 trial was conducted. Patients with RCC were
randomized 1:1 in an open label study to receive Nap+IFN-α
or IFN-α: 15 μg/kg Nap was given intravenously in three
cycles of four once daily injections plus IFN-α (9 MU
subcutaneously three times weekly) or the same dose
and schedule of IFN-α monotherapy. We have previously
presented the final results (ASCO annual meeting 2013
abstract ID 3073, European Cancer Congress (ECCO) 2013
abstract ID 2710 and manuscript submitted for publication).
Although the study did not meet the primary endpoint,
addition of Nap to IFN-α might improve OS and PFS in
a subgroup of patients with low IL-6 and normal levels
of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies. Furthermore it was shown
that patients from certain territories had increased levels of
baseline anti-SEA/E-120 and low Nap exposure. Patients
in the United Kingdom (UK) had expected levels of antiSEA/E-120 and Nap exposure. During the study in the
UK, we extended sampling in association to Nap treatment
to include also peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
analyzed Nap induced changes in different lymphocyte
subsets. In this paper we analyzed the UK patients for their
immunological response to the Nap treatment in relation to
their potential benefit and prolonged overall survival.

three times weekly) and 22 UK patients received the
same dose and schedule of IFN-α monotherapy except
for weeks with Nap treatment. Patient characteristics
are summarized in Table 1. Thirty two out of 40 patients
received first line treatment. Twenty three patients had
good and 17 patients had intermediate MSKCC risk score.
The UK population was rather well balanced although a
slight overrepresentation of patients with intermediate
MSKCC risk score and higher IL-6 was seen in the IFN-α
monotherapy arm.

Changes of lymphocyte subsets in blood during
Nap treatment
Nine patients donated blood for lymphocyte subset
analysis during Nap treatment. Four-color flow cytometric
assays were performed to measure the level of Napspecific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients prior to
and after treatment with Nap. T lymphocytes expressing
T cell receptors containing TRBV7–9 bind Nap and can
be activated by Nap [11]. An example of flow cytometric
analysis during the three Nap treatment cycles is shown
in Figure 1A. Levels of Nap-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells for all patients at all analyzed time points are shown
in Figures 1D and 1E, respectively. At baseline, Napspecific CD4+ T cell level (0.86%) was significantly higher
than Nap-specific CD8+ T cells (0.35%) (p = 0.001). The
frequency of Nap-specific CD4+ T cells in peripheral
blood was reduced after 3 treatment days in samples
collected pre-dose on day 4 (C1D4, p = 0.09). However,
levels of both Nap-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
were significantly higher 8 days after the first treatment
(C1D8, p = 0.02 and 0.04), as shown in Figure 1. The
total number of T lymphocytes, Nap-specific as well as
non-specific (data not shown), were reduced in peripheral
blood after 3 days of treatment and expanded on day
8, 4 days after the last Nap injection. The four patients
(patients 101–01, 101–11, 101–13 and 106–01) with the
most pronounced Nap-specific T lymphocyte reduction on
day 4 and expansion on day 8 are depicted in Figure 2.
The expansion of Nap-specific T cells at C1D8 was higher
within the CD4+ T-cell subpopulation, compared to the
CD8+ T cell subpopulation. In addition, patient 101–13
showed increased Nap-specific T cell frequencies at day
8 of cycle 2 (C2D8) as well (Figure 1B).
Some patients (e.g. 101–13; Figures 1B and 1C)
showed expansion of CD8+Nap+ T cells but in general Nap+
T cells were detected mainly (>70%) within the CD4+ T
population and most patients showed an expansion of
CD4+Nap+ T cells (Figures 1D and 1E). The CD4+Nap+ T
cells were analyzed for different distinct subsets referring
to memory (CD45RO), homing to central lymphoid organs
(CD62L) and suppression (Foxp3). Figure 3A shows an
example of the flow cytometric analysis, and CD45RO+/−
within CD4+Nap+ and CD4+Nap− T cells for all analyzed
patients are depicted in Figures 3B and 3C. Both CD45RO+

and CD45RO− cells were reduced in CD4+Nap+ T cells at
C1D4, but CD45RO expression was still higher (0.28%
versus 0.14%, p = 0.06, Figure 3B). Interestingly, a majority
of the expanded CD4+Nap+ T cells displayed a memory
phenotype; CD45RO was expressed in 58% of CD4+Nap+
T cells at C1D8 (p = 0.16, Figure 3B). There were no
significant changes in frequency of CD45RO+ cells within
CD4+Nap− T cells following treatment (Figure 3C).
Both CD62L+ and CD62L− cells were reduced
in CD4+Nap+ T cells at C1D4 (Figure 3D and 3E),
but the percentage of CD62L+ cells was significantly
lower (0.13% versus 0.35%, p = 0.02). Lack of CD62L
expression at C1D4 could indicate that the majority
of CD4+Nap+ T cells expressing CD62L had entered
the secondary lymphoid tissues as CD62L is a receptor
allowing lymphocytes to home to such lymphoid tissues.
Interestingly, when CD4+Nap+ T cells were expanded in
peripheral blood at C1D8, there was a tendency for more
cells expressing CD62L (1.43% versus 1.11%, p = 0.25).
For CD4+Nap− T cells, again the majority of cells (76%,
Figure 3F) lacked CD62L expression at C1D4 (p = 0.001),
with no difference at C1D8 (p = 0.84, Figure 3F).

We investigated levels of Foxp3+ Treg cells in
peripheral blood of patients before and after treatment.
Patient 101–13 showed expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs
during all cycles of treatment and they bounced to baseline
level by the end of study (data not shown). Overall analysis
for all patients showed the expansion of CD4+Foxp3+Nap−
Tregs; Treg levels were significantly higher at most time
points after treatment, compared to pre-treatment level.
Of note, the Treg expansion was detected mainly after 3
days of treatment within any of the cycles (Figure 4B).
Immunotherapeutic modalities such as therapeutic cancer
vaccines may expand tumour antigen-specific Tregs as
well as antigen-specific T effector cells, which can induce
immune suppression and dampen the expansion of tumour
antigen-specific T effector cells [13]. Nap staining was
combined with Foxp3 intracellular staining to determine
the levels of Nap-specific Foxp3+ Tregs. Prior to treatment,
Foxp3 was expressed mainly within CD4+Nap− T cells,
compared to CD4+Nap+ T cells (p = 0.006). Interestingly,
Foxp3 expansion was seen within the CD4+Nap− T cells,
but not within the CD4+Nap+ subpopulation at any time
point after treatment (Figures 4A and 4B).

Cytokine production during Nap treatment

Nap treatment cycle (Figure 5B). Furthermore, IL-2
production was most pronounced in the patients with
low anti-SEA/E-120 (as below). The inverse relationship
between anti-SEA/E-120 antibody concentration in plasma
and IL-2 production was also shown for the whole study
(ASCO annual meeting 2013 abstract ID 3073, European
Cancer Congress (ECCO) 2013 abstract ID 2710 and
manuscript submitted for publication).

Seventeen of 18 Nap treated patients were analyzed
for cytokine production as response to Nap. Cytokine
production was measured pre-dose and 3 hours after Nap
injection and the resulting increased plasma concentration
served as a biomarker for Nap induced T lymphocyte
activation and expansion. IL-2 may serve as a surrogate
marker for T lymphocyte expansion. The T cell cytokines
IL-2 and IFN-γ were elevated 3 hours after Nap (Figure 5
and Table 2). In addition to IL-2 and IFN-γ, Nap caused
an increase of other cytokines including IL-6, IL-10 and
TNF-α (Figure 5B). For most patients the induced systemic
IL-2 levels were greatest during the first treatment cycle
and were negligible during cycles 2 and 3. Patient 101–13
having a pronounced T cell response, including expansion
of T cells also in cycle 2, showed increased plasma levels
of IL-2 and other cytokines also in cycle 2 (Figure 5B).
The different cytokines had distinct timely profiles. The
four patients (patients 101–01, 101–11, 101–13 and 106–

Antibodies binding to Nap (anti-SEA/E-120) and
interleukin-6 at baseline
Nap is a fusion protein of bacterial and mouse
origin. The superantigen moiety of Nap has been
engineered to have low binding to baseline human
antibodies [8]. Despite this fact, increased baseline antiSEA/E-120 antibody levels were detected in certain
territories predicting for suboptimal exposure, which
may affect drug activity and anti-tumour efficacy (ASCO
annual meeting 2013 abstract ID 3073, European Cancer
Congress (ECCO) 2013 abstract ID 2710 and manuscript
submitted for publication). Baseline levels of antibodies
binding to SEA/E-120 were detectable in all patients and

Overall survival in the UK patient subset
with focus on patients with Nap induced
T lymphocyte response

they had a median of 53.5 pmol/mL in the whole study.
In the UK subset of patients 17 of 18 Nap treated patients
and 14 of the control patients were analysed for antiSEA/E-120 antibody levels at baseline. The median level
of anti-SEA/E-120 in the UK patients was 34 pmol/mL,
which is lower as compared to other study territories and
at similar level as recorded in phase 1 [12].
The patients were also analysed for IL-6 in plasma
at baseline. Baseline levels of IL-6 were detectable in
most patients (22% < LLOQ) and they had a median of
7 pg/mL in the whole study, similar to the UK subset. At
normal and low levels of IL-6, disease has not yet tipped
the immune status into suppression. Accordingly patients
with non-elevated systemic IL-6 levels would be expected
to have the best chance of responding to immunotherapy.
Indeed baseline plasma IL-6 was predictive of benefit with
tumour vaccines [14, 15] but also for pazopanib [16].
Geometric means of anti-SEA/E-120 and IL-6 in
the Nap treated UK subset of patients were 40.1 pmol/
mL and 5.4 pg/mL, respectively (Table 2). Therefore
this population had a favourable baseline profile for
responding to the Nap immunotherapy as compared to the
whole study population and the majority of treated UK
patients analysed for the baseline biomarkers had low
levels of the predictive biomarkers (Figure 5A).

A total of 373 deaths (73% of patients) had occurred
at the predefined final OS analysis in the ITT population.
Median OS for the patients treated with Nap+IFN-α was
17.1 months versus 17.5 months for the patients receiving
IFN-α alone. No difference of OS between treatment arms
in the ITT population was detected and accordingly the
primary endpoint OS was not reached for the whole phase
2/3 study, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.08. PFS showed HR
of 0.92. Anti-SEA/E-120, a biomarker for drug exposure,
and IL-6, a biomarker for immune responsiveness,
were assessed as predictive baseline biomarkers. In a
subgroup of patients having below median of baseline
anti-SEA/E-120 and IL-6, prolonged PFS (HR = 0.62,
p = 0.016) and OS (HR = 0.59, p = 0.020) were achieved
(ASCO annual meeting 2013 abstract ID 3073, European
Cancer Congress (ECCO) 2013 abstract ID 2710 and
manuscript submitted for publication). 31 deaths (78% of
patients) had occurred at the predefined final OS analysis
in the UK population. Median OS for the UK patients
treated with Nap+IFN-α was 27.4 months versus 12.4
months for the patients receiving IFN-α alone (Figure 6A;

HR (95% CI) = 0.56 (0.26, 1.19), p = 0.13 stratified for

The 17 UK patients analysed for IL-2 during Nap
treatment were defined according to MSKCC risk (good
or intermediate) and if they had overall survival below 18
months, between 18 and 36 months or more than 36 months.
A clear tendency of higher IL-2 responses was seen in
patients surviving more than 36 months (Table 2). All but one
Nap treated patients surviving more than 18 months showed
IL-2 response after treatment. The patient lacking IL-2
response (<20 pg/mL) with long survival had high baseline
levels of anti-SEA/E-120. The patients surviving less than
18 months responded poorly with IL-2 and/or had high
baseline levels of anti-SEA/E-120 or IL-6. The four patients
(patients 101–01, 101–11, 101–13 and 106–01) with the
most pronounced Nap-specific T lymphocyte reduction on
day 4 and expansion on day 8 showed high IL-2 production
as measured in plasma during the first Nap treatment cycle
(Figure 2 and Figure 5B) and survived longer than 18 months
(Figure 6). Patients 101–01 and 101–11 were MSKCC

intermediate risk patients with survival longer than 23
months and patients 101–13 and 106–01 (106–01 showing
PR) were MSKCC good risk patients with long survival
(> 40 months) (Figures 6B and 6C). Interestingly, patients
with OS > 36 months showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher
ratio of plasma IL-2 level at 3 hours after the first and second
day of Nap treatment to IL-6 baseline level, compared to
patients with OS < 18 months (Table 2).
Both intermediate and good MSKCC risk patients
with low levels of baseline anti-SEA/E-120 and IL-6
responding with IL-2 in blood plasma and blood T cell
reduction day 4 and expansion day 8 after start of the Nap
treatment cycle were found to be among patients with
relatively long survival indicating that this biomarker
pattern might be important for clinical activity.

DISCUSSION
Although the phase 2/3 study did not meet its primary
endpoint, addition of Nap to IFN-α improved OS (HR: 0.59;

patients with normal levels of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies
and low IL-6 levels. In this paper we have analysed the Nap
induced immune response in a cohort of the UK patients
to characterize baseline biomarkers and immune response
patterns in relation to potential benefit from Nap treatment.
The superantigen moiety of Nap has been
engineered to have low binding to baseline human
antibodies [8]. Despite this fact increased anti-SEA/E-120
antibody levels may affect drug activity and anti-tumour
efficacy. In the phase 2/3 study the baseline concentration
of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies was unexpectedly higher
in certain territories and exposure accordingly lower.
Most patients in the phase 1 studies, all having low antiSEA/E-120 antibody titres, were from the US, the UK and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Scandinavia and as expected most patients in this study
from the UK had also low concentrations of baseline antiSEA/E-120.
IL-6 is implicated in the pathophysiology of
various solid tumours. High IL-6 levels are prognostic
and correlate with tumour metastasis, disease stage, and
short survival in several cancers including RCC [17–
19]. The IL-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway is one of
the most important signaling pathways associated with
tumour development and induction of tumour induced
immune suppression [20]. IL-6 is therefore a biomarker
for immune status of the tumour microenvironment
and for a patient’s chronic inflammation/immune
suppression status in general. At normal and low

levels of IL-6, disease has not yet tipped the immune
status into suppression. Accordingly patients with nonelevated systemic IL-6 levels would be expected to
have the best chance of responding to immunotherapy.
Indeed baseline plasma IL-6 was predictive of benefit
with tumour vaccines [14, 15] but also for pazopanib
[16]. In the phase 2/3 study IL-6 was shown to be both
prognostic as well as predictive for Nap activity since
the subgroup and a trend analysis clearly supported
that low baseline anti-SEA/E-120 and IL-6 plasma
levels independently predict anti-tumour efficacy after
Nap+IFN-α treatment.
Generally in the patients from the UK cohort, the
expansion of Nap+ T cells was detected in peripheral
blood during first cycle of treatment, usually at day 8.
The baseline biomarkers for Nap exposure and/or low
tumour induced immune suppression coincided with IL-2
production after Nap treatment as well as the expansion of
Nap+ T cells. Interestingly, the expansion of Nap-specific
CD4+ T cells was detected in Foxp3− and not Foxp3+ cells,
confirming that Nap expands Nap-specific T effector cells
but not Nap-specific Tregs.
The subset of patients with low levels of antibodies
towards Nap and low IL-6, indicating that tumour induced
immune suppression has not yet been established, and
having relatively early disease (i.e. good MSKCC risk
score), seems to have the best benefit, as evaluated by OS,
of the Nap immunotherapy. The immune cells of this subset
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of patients can be activated to pronounced IL-2 production
resulting Nap-specific expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
which probably is a prerequisite for optimal Nap induced
anti-tumour effects. In previous studies we have shown that
T cells infiltrate tumours after Nap treatment in responding
patients [12]. Therefore, it may be speculated that Nap acts
in two phases; 1) Induction of T cell activation, proliferation
and maturation into effector cells, 2) Recruitment to and T
cell killing (SADCC) of the tumour.
IL-2 may serve as a surrogate marker for T cell
expansion. Hypothetically, Nap treatment induced antitumour effects require T cell activation and expansion
in advance to that the T effectors infiltrate the tumour to
cause tumour cell elimination. The patients in the UK
subset of this phase 2/3 study showed a tendency of OS
benefit after Nap treatment. Most Nap treated patients
with long OS had low baseline plasma IL-6 and normal
levels of anti-SEA/E-120. Furthermore, patients with
pronounced Nap induced IL-2 in plasma and verified T
cell expansion on day 8 after initiation of Nap treatment
had long OS. In conclusion, patients with low baseline
IL-6 and anti-SEA/E-120 may respond well to Nap by
triggering T cell activation and expansion (IL-2) paving
the way for anti-tumour effects documented as prolonged
OS. Being a very efficient T cell trigger and stimulator
of tumour infiltrating T cells, Nap may also represent an
optimal combo to checkpoint immunotherapy such as
anti-PD-1 therapy [21].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Forty ml blood samples were collected in
heparinized tubes from nine patients with extended
consents for lymphocyte phenotype analyses. Blood
samples were collected pre-dose, at dosing Day 1 and Day
4 of Weeks 1, 9 and 17 (Day 1, Day 4, Day 57, Day 60,
Day 113 and Day 116 respectively), at Day 8, at Day 64,
at Day 120 and at week 25, which represent cycle 1 day
1 (C1D1, baseline), C1D4, C1D8, C2D1, C2D4, C2D8,
C3D1, C3D4, C3D8 and week 25.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
separated by Ficoll Hypaque density centrifugation and
cells were collected from the interface, washed twice
in PBS then frozen at a concentration of 1 × 107/ml in
freezing media (90% FCS and 10% DMSO) and stored in
Liquid Nitrogen until required. A reagent, the Nap/strepPE complex, was used to detect SEA/E-120 binding
T cells [11]. The Nap/strep-PE complex was used in
combination with CD3-PerCP, CD4-FITC and CD8APC antibodies to measure the percentage of CD3+CD4+
and CD3+CD8+ T cells specific for SEA/E-120. CD62L
and CD45RO were used to measure the frequency of
naïve and memory Nap+ and Nap− cells within CD4+
and CD8+ T cells before and after treatment. Frozen
PBMCs were thawed and stained with Nap/strep-PE
conjugate in addition to different monoclonal antibodies
before flow cytometric analysis using FACSCalibur or
FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometers. Data
analysis was performed using FlowJo version 7.5.5
software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA). T regulatory
cells (Tregs) were determined by their expression of
CD4 and Foxp3. For detection of Nap+ and Nap− cells
within CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, cells were first stained for
extracellular CD4 and Nap markers using anti-human
CD4-PerCP and anti-human Nap/strep-PE. Following
fixation and permeabilization using eBioscience fix/
perm buffers, the cells were washed and blocked for nonspecific binding sites using normal rat serum. Then antihuman Foxp3-APC or rat IgG2a-APC isotype negative
control (eBioscience) were added for 30 minutes before
washing twice and flow cytometric analysis.

Patients
From May 2007 to October 2010, 513 RCC patients
in Bulgaria (76), Romania (56), Russia (188), Ukraine
(153) and UK (40) were randomized 1:1 and treated with
Nap+IFN-α or IFN-α in a multinational, multicenter,
randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2/3 study
in patients with confirmed metastatic or inoperable locally
advanced RCC eligible for standard therapy with IFN-α.
Results from the whole study will be published elsewhere.
Additional key eligibility criteria were histologically or
cytologically confirmed clear cell or papillary type RCC,
Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70, good or intermediate
risk group prognosis by MSKCC risk score criteria (score
0–2), life expectancy > 3 months and acceptable levels
of specific haematology and serum chemistry parameters.
The patients from the UK were selected for additional
analysis of immune response during Nap treatment in
relation to their potential benefit from Nap as evaluated
by overall survival.

Study design
After screening and enrolment, patients with RCC
were randomized 1:1 to receive Nap+IFN-α or established
treatment with IFN-α. Stratification was to establish
balance between the treatment arms with regard to a
prognostic index based on MSKCC risk and first versus
second line of treatments. Patients in the active arm 1 were
given 15 μg/kg Nap intravenously in three cycles of four
once daily injections plus IFN-α, 9 MU subcutaneously
three times weekly, except for the Nap treatment weeks
or the same dose and schedule of IFN-α monotherapy.
Nap treatment cycles were given weeks 1, 9 and 17 and
IFN-α during all other weeks up to 18 months and IFN-α
monotherapy in treatment arm 2 was given from week
1 up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was overall
survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were PFS, response
rate, immunological response to treatment in patients
receiving Nap and safety. The main analysis on OS data
from all patients was predefined to be executed at expected
383 events.

Statistical methods and analysis
The statistics in this paper should be seen as
descriptive as the sample size in this sub-study is not high
enough to detect differences in OS. Furthermore, statistical
tests are presented and no adjustment for multiplicity
has been done. Testing of OS versus treatment arms was
done with the log-rank test and the hazard ratio with
95% confidence intervals was calculated with the Cox
Regression methods, both stratified for MSKCC risk
score (SAS, version 9.3, PROC LIFETEST and PHREG).
Tests of biomarkers were done with Student’s paired and
un-paired t-test. Test of Biomarker level for patients with OS
with short versus long survival was done with Spearman’s
Correlation. Two-sided tests with p-values < 0.05 were
regarded as significant.

Biomarkers and immunopharmacology
Multiple blood samples were collected at specific
time points (baseline and during treatment) for antiSEA/E-120 and cytokines. Cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10,
IFN-γ and TNF-α) as a measure for immune activation
were assayed at 0 and 3 hours on Days 1 and 2 of the
Nap treatment cycles. Baseline plasma IL-6 and all antiSEA/E-120 concentrations were measured with ELISA
methods (Quantikine, R&D Systems and modified from
[12]) and the plasma cytokine response patterns were
analysed with a cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences).
