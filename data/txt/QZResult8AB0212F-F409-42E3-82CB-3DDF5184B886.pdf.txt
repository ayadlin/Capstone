Abstract
c-Ski is an important corepressor of transforming growth
factor-B (TGF-B) signaling through its ability to bind to and
repress the activity of the Smad proteins. It was initially identified as an oncogene that promotes anchorage-independent
growth of chicken and quail embryo fibroblasts when overexpressed. Although increased Ski expression is detected in
many human cancer cells, the roles of Ski in mammalian
carcinogenesis have yet to be defined. Here, we report that
reducing Ski expression in breast and lung cancer cells does
not affect tumor growth but enhances tumor metastasis
in vivo. Thus, in these cells, Ski plays an antitumorigenic role.
We also showed that TGF-B, a cytokine that is often highly
expressed in metastatic tumors, induces Ski degradation
through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome in malignant
human cancer cells. On TGF-B treatment, the E3 ubiquitin
ligase Arkadia mediates degradation of Ski in a Smaddependent manner. Although Arkadia interacts with Ski in
the absence of TGF-B, binding of phosphorylated Smad2 or
Smad3 to Ski is required to induce efficient degradation of
Ski by Arkadia. Our results suggest that the ability of TGF-B
to induce degradation of Ski could be an additional mechanism contributing to its protumorigenic activity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Ski was identified as the transforming protein (v-Ski) of the avian
Sloan-Kettering virus (1). The cellular homologue of v-ski, c-ski, was
later cloned based on sequence homologies (2). The oncogenic
activity of Ski is primarily defined by its ability to promote
anchorage-independent growth of chicken and quail embryo fibroblast when overexpressed (3). Consistent with this, Ski has been
found to be expressed at high levels in human cancer cells derived
from melanoma, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and leukemia (4–8). However, Ski may also contain an
antitumorigenic activity. Ski+/ mice were found to display an
increased susceptibility to chemical-induced tumorigenesis (9).
The human ski gene is located at chromosome 1p36, a potential
tumor suppressor locus that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma
and melanoma (10–12). Clearly, the roles of Ski in mammalian
tumorigenesis are complex, and more studies are needed to define

the functions of Ski. We have recently reported that SnoN exerts
both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities at different
stages of tumorigenesis (13). Whether Ski has similar activities at
different stages of mammalian carcinogenesis or exerts opposite
effects in cancer cells of various origin has yet to be determined.
Ski and SnoN are important negative regulators of transforming
growth factor-h (TGF-h) signaling (14). TGF-h family of cytokines
plays important roles in the regulation of mammalian cell growth,
differentiation, and cancer (15–19). In normal epithelial cells or
during early stages of carcinogenesis, TGF-h acts as a tumor
suppressor by promoting cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and through
maintaining tissue homeostasis. These growth-inhibitory activities
are often inactivated during malignant progression. At later stages
of tumorigenesis, TGF-h promotes tumor invasiveness and
metastasis through its ability to induce epithelial to mesenchymal
transdifferentiation (EMT) and to modulate the extracellular
stromal microenvironment in favor of tumor growth.
Smad proteins are important mediators of TGF-h signaling
(20, 21). On ligand binding, active TGF-h receptor (TGF-hR)
complex phosphorylates the receptor-activated Smad proteins
(R-Smad) Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated R-Smads then form
heteromeric complexes with a common mediator Smad, Smad4,
and translocate into the nucleus. In collaboration with other
transcription factors, the heteromeric Smad complexes bind to
promoter DNA and activate or repress transcription of TGF-h
target genes. Smad complexes are subjected to positive and
negative regulation through association with cellular partners. In
particular, we and others have shown that Ski interacts with
Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and represses their ability to activate
TGF-h–responsive genes through disrupting the functional heteromeric Smad complexes, recruiting a transcriptional corepressor
complex and preventing the binding of transcriptional coactivators
(14). As a negative regulator of TGF-h signaling, it is conceivable
that Ski may also possess both tumor-promoting and tumorsuppressive activities at different stages of tumorigenesis.
Ski is expressed in almost all adult and embryonic tissues but at
low levels (1, 2, 22–24). Up-regulation of Ski expression occurs
during certain stages of embryonic development and later in some
human cancers. In vivo studies using Xenopus, zebrafish, or mice
have shown that Ski plays critical roles during development of
neuronal, craniofacial, and muscle lineages, possibly through
modulating bone morphogenetic protein signaling (25–27). The
activity and expression of Ski can be regulated at the level of
transcriptional activation, posttranslational modification, protein
stability, as well as intracellular localization. In melanoma, Ski can
be up-regulated at the transcriptional level through yet to be identified mechanism (28). Although Ski has been identified as a nuclear
protein, in invasive melanoma Ski localizes also in the cytoplasm.
How this may affect its function in melanoma is still unclear (4).

Ski is also regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome. During
renal fibrosis induced by obstructive injury, Ski degradation is
enhanced (29). Macdonald et al. (30) have shown that Ski stability
can be regulated by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 in a
cell cycle–dependent manner. The steady-state level of Ski may be
additionally regulated by phosphorylation, which prevents Ski
degradation during mitosis (31). Finally, two recent studies have
reported that overexpression of Arkadia, an E3 ligase, induces the
degradation of SnoN and Ski (32, 33).
It is well known that TGF-h expression is often up-regulated in
metastatic tumors (16, 18). TGF-h can induce efficient ubiquitination and degradation of SnoN by multiple ubiquitination pathways
and has been reported to induce the degradation of a transfected
Ski in Mink lung epithelial cells (34–37). However, unlike the case of
SnoN, degradation of Ski is not readily observed in all cell types
(38). Although Ski can be degraded by overexpression of Arkadia
(33), whether this pathway, when present at physiologic concentrations, is responsible for TGF-h–induced degradation of Ski is not
clear. More importantly, the cellular context under which this
degradation occurs has not been defined.
In this study, we investigated the function of Ski in tumorigenesis
by down-regulating its expression in A549 lung cancer cells and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We report that down-regulation
of Ski expression does not suppress tumor growth but enhances
tumor metastasis in vivo. We also found that TGF-h induces
efficient degradation of Ski through the ubiquitin-dependent
proteasome pathway. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 cooperate
with Arkadia to induce efficient degradation of Ski. Finally, as
TGF-h is highly expressed in metastatic tumors, our result that
TGF-h induces degradation of Ski may suggest an additional
mechanism supporting the prometastatic role of TGF-h.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Melanoma cells were maintained as described previously
(39). 293T cells, A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, A375 melanoma
cells, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435, BT474, T47D,
ZR75B, and BT549 human breast cancer cells, and MCF-10A mammary
epithelial cells were maintained as described previously (13). These
breast cancer cell lines were generous gifts of M.J. Bissell (Life Sciences
Division, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
Berkeley, CA).
Assays for TGF-B responses. A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with the p3TP-lux reporter constructs. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were serum starved for 8 h and luciferase activity was
measured 16 h after stimulation with 50 pmol/L TGF-h1. For the growth
inhibition assay, 3.5  104 MDA-MB-231 or A549 cells were cultured for 4 d
with the indicated concentrations of TGF-h1. The growth of cells was
determined by cell counting.
Transformation and tumor growth assays. Soft agar assays to analyze
anchorage-independent growth were performed as described previously
(13). To measure tumorigenicity in vivo in nude mice, female athymic
BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) at 4 to 6 wk of age were injected
s.c. with various cancer cell lines and tumor growth was monitored as
described earlier (13).
In vivo metastasis assays. MDA-MB-231 cells (1  105 in 0.1 mL PBS/
mouse) were injected into the left cardiac ventricle of 4-wk-old female nude
mice. Animals were monitored for paraplegia and the body weight of each
mouse was measured weekly. After 4 wk, mice were sacrificed and the lungs
were fixed in Bouin’s solution. Metastatic nodules were counted at the lung
surface under a dissecting microscope. Bone metastasis in tibia was
determined as previously described (13).
To detect paraplegia as a measure of skeletal muscular function due to
bone metastasis, a wire hang test was performed as previously described

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

(13). The results were indicated as mean latency to fall from the lid in
seconds F SE.
To examine metastasis of A549 lung cancer cells, 2  106 cells in 0.1 mL
PBS were injected into the lateral tail veins of 4-wk-old female nude mice.
After 3 mo, the mice were sacrificed and the number of metastasis nodules
was determined on lungs fixed in Bouin’s solution (13).
Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Cell lysis,
immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as previously
described (13). For inhibition of proteasome degradation, cells were
pretreated with 50 Amol/L MG132. For TGF-h–mediated degradation of
Ski, 100 pmol/L TGF-h1 was used. In some experiments, the cells were
pretreated for 1 h with either 10 Amol/L SB-431542, 10 Amol/L SP600125,
5 Amol/L SB-20358, or 10 Amol/L Y-27632.

Results
Down-regulation of Ski expression enhances tumor metastasis in vivo. To investigate the role of Ski in malignant transformation, we stably introduced a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
directed against human Ski into MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells to
reduce its expression. MDA-MB-231 is a metastatic human breast
cancer cell line that expresses high levels of Ski and SnoN (13).
A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells express high levels of SnoN
but low levels of Ski (13). Both cell lines are resistant to the
cytostatic effect of TGF-h. pSUPER vector expressing ski shRNA
was introduced into these cells by transfection together with a
plasmid expressing a puromycin resistance gene. A significant
reduction of Ski expression was detected in several stable
puromycin-resistant clones (Fig. 1A).
Because Ski is a negative regulator of TGF-h signaling, we first
tested whether down-regulation of Ski expression enhanced TGFh–induced transcription. Parental and shSki cells were transfected
with the p3TP-lux luciferase reporter followed by treatment with
TGF-h. Whereas reducing Ski expression did not affect basal
reporter activity, TGF-h–induced transcription was enhanced in
both MDA-MB-231 and A549 shSki cells. Thus, reducing Ski
expression enhanced TGF-h signaling.
Both A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells are resistant to growth
inhibition by TGF-h, possibly due to high levels of SnoN and Ski
expression. Interestingly, reducing Ski expression in these cells
was not sufficient to elicit a growth-inhibitory response to TGF-h
(Fig. 1C), most likely because of the presence of high levels of SnoN
and the relative expression level of Ski in these cell lines. The low
level of Ski expression in A549 cells may account for this lack of
effect, and the presence of high levels of SnoN in these cells
probably contributes to the inhibition of TGF-h signaling. Indeed,
when both Ski and SnoN were knocked down, the growth of
A549 cells was inhibited effectively by TGF-h and a partial growth
arrest was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, it seems that
Ski expression in tumor cells contributes to their resistance to
TGF-h–induced growth arrest.
In a soft agar assay to measure the transforming activity of these
cells, reducing Ski expression in MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells had
no effect on anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 1D). Consistent
with this, Ski knockdown did not affect tumor growth in vivo in
nude mice (data not shown). In contrast, reducing SnoN expression fully blocked soft agar colony formation (13). Thus, unlike the
related SnoN and in contrast to its transforming activity in chicken
embryo fibroblasts, Ski does not seem to affect mitogenic
transformation of human breast and lung cancer cells.
Given that Ski did not affect tumor growth in our assays, we next
compared the ability of MDA-MB-231 parental and shSki cells to

Figure 1. Ski does not affect mitogenic transformation
of human cancer cells. A, reduction of Ski expression
in A549 lung cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells by shRNA. Stable cell lines expressing the shRNA

and Methods. Ski expression in the representative stable

blotting with anti-Ski. Whole-cell extracts were blotted with
anti-a-tubulin as a loading control. B, down-regulation of

and shRNA-expressing cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of TGF-h1 and cultured for 4 d. The
growth of cells was determined by cell counting and

cells. D, reducing Ski expression had no effect on
anchorage-independent growth of A549 and MDA-MB-231

induce secondary lung and bone metastases in an in vivo metastasis assay. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, although both
parental and shSki cells induced bone and lung metastasis, mice
inoculated with shSki cells displayed a moderate but significant
and reproducible increase in lung metastasis. These mice also
showed a 2-fold increase in bone metastasis (Fig. 2A) as well as a
more severe paraplegia, as indicated by the reduced latency to fall
down from a wire lid in a wire hang test (Fig. 2B). Thus, downregulation of Ski enhances the metastatic potential of MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells. Similar to what was observed with
MDA-MB-231 cells, A549 lung cancer cells with reduced levels of
Ski displayed a 2-fold increase in metastatic potential over the
parental cells (Fig. 2C).
The ability of Ski to inhibit tumor metastasis was further substantiated by microarray analysis. Using the Affymetrix U133(A+B)
arrays to compare the transcriptome of parental MDA-MB-231
and shSki cells, we identified among the group of genes whose
expressions were altered by Ski knockdown a set of genes known
to be involved in regulation of EMT and metastasis or identified as prognostic markers of metastasis. A subset of these
genes is shown in Supplementary Table S1. The differential expres-

www.aacrjournals.org

sion of some genes was further confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; Fig. 2D). Consistent with the observed increase
in metastasis, shSki cells showed up-regulation of many metastasis-promoting genes, including AGR2, HMGA2, and SLUG, and
down-regulation of genes inhibitory to metastasis, including
KISS-1 and FHL1. Some of these genes are also regulated by the
Smad proteins and TGF-h signaling. For examples, among the
genes that are up-regulated in shSki cells, HMGA2 and SLUG can
be induced by TGF-h in a Smad-dependent manner (40, 41).
Other genes, such as FHL1, a tumor suppressor gene that acts
downstream of Src and Cas to block tumor migration, is downregulated in shSki cells but has not yet been identified as a TGFh–responsive gene. These results suggest that Ski may regulate
tumor metastasis in vivo through both TGF-h–dependent and
TGF-h–independent pathways.
Taken together, these observations indicate that Ski inhibits
tumor metastasis in vivo.

This observation, together with the ability of Ski to inhibit tumor
metastasis, would predict that its expression is reduced in

metastatic cancer cells. We therefore examined expression of Ski in
a panel of metastatic melanoma cells and a variety of breast cancer
cell lines. Surprisingly, Ski was expressed in all metastatic
melanoma cell lines at reasonably high levels as well as in all breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A). No major difference in the steady-state
level of Ski was detected between nonmetastatic breast cancer cell
lines (MCF7, BT474, ZR75B, and T47D) and highly invasive,
metastatic breast cancer lines (MDA-MB-231, BT549, and MDAMB-435; Fig. 3A). This raised the important question of whether Ski
expression in these cell lines is subjected to dynamic regulation by
cytokines or factors known to be active during metastasis.
Because TGF-h is often up-regulated in metastatic tumor cells
and has been reported to induce Ski degradation under some
circumstances, we next examined the level of Ski expression when
various human cancer cell lines were treated with TGF-h1. As
shown in Fig. 3B, Ski protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells was
markedly reduced on TGF-h treatment, with a maximal effect after
40 min of TGF-h treatment, and remained barely detectable
4 h later. These results showed that TGF-h induced a dramatic
reduction of Ski protein in MDA-MB-231. To assess how general
this regulation is, we checked for the regulation of Ski expression
by TGF-h in a panel of human breast cancer and melanoma cell
lines. TGF-h induced a moderate reduction of Ski expression in
several breast cancer cell lines, including BT474, MDA-MB-231, and
MDA-MB-435, but not in T47D and ZR75B cells (Fig. 3C), which do
not express the TGF-hRII, or in MDA-MB-468 cells (data not show),
which carry a chromosomal deletion encompassing the entire
Smad4 locus (42). Similar data were obtained in melanoma cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Altogether, these data showed that
TGF-h can reduce the level of Ski in various metastatic cancer cell
lines. Interestingly, although melanoma cells are resistant to the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

TGF-h–induced growth inhibition, mutations of the TGF-hRs or
the Smad proteins have not been reported. Thus, an active TGF-h/
Smad signaling pathway may be present in these melanoma cells to
regulate the expression of Ski.
We next evaluated whether TGF-h affected the transcription or
degradation of Ski. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with TGF-h,
and Ski transcription was monitored by semiquantitative RT-PCR
and Ski degradation was measured by Western blotting after
treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. TGF-h did not affect Ski
transcription (Supplementary Fig. S2B) but induced degradation of
the Ski protein because treatment of cells with MG132 abrogated
TGF-h–induced down-regulation of Ski (Fig. 3D). Thus, TGF-h
induces degradation of Ski through the proteasome pathway.
Degradation of proteins by the proteasome requires prior
polyubiquitination. To determine whether Ski is polyubiquitinated
in response to TGF-h, Flag-Ski was transfected into 293T cells
together with or without the constitutively active ALK5 and
isolated by immunoprecipitation. Ubiquitination of Ski was
detected by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2C, activation of TGF-h signaling
readily induced polyubiquitination of Ski. Interestingly, when the
Smad-binding sites were mutated in Ski, this polyubiquitination
was eliminated (Supplementary Fig. S2C), suggesting that the Smad
pathway may be involved in Ski degradation.
TGF-B–induced degradation of Ski through the Smad
pathway. TGF-h activates both Smad-dependent and Smadindependent pathways, such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK),
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and RhoA
pathways. To determine which of these pathways is activated by
TGF-h to down-regulate Ski expression, specific pharmacologic
inhibitors of JNK (SP600125), p38MAPK (SB-20358), and ROCK

(Y-27632) were used. As a positive control, SB-431542, the TGF-hRI
inhibitor, was included. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated for
1 h with various inhibitors at concentrations shown to fully inhibit
their target pathways without significant nonspecific activity
followed by treatment with or without TGF-h for 40 min. In the
absence of TGF-h, Ski expression was slightly stabilized by SB431542 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that inhibition of autocrine TGF-h
signaling may increase Ski stability. In the presence of TGF-h,
degradation of Ski was abrogated efficiently by SB-431542 (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, inhibitors of JNK, p38MAPK, and ROCK did not affect
the level of Ski either in the absence or in the presence of TGF-h
(Fig. 4A). This suggests that Ski degradation by TGF-h is most likely
mediated by the canonical Smad pathway.
To further confirm this point, pool of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) duplex directed against Smad2 and Smad3 was transfected
into MDA-MB-231 cells before the TGF-h treatment. Individual
knockdown of Smad2 and Smad3 did not affect TGF-h–induced
degradation of Ski (Fig. 4B). However, when both Smad2 and
Smad3 were reduced by concomitant siRNA transfection, Ski
degradation in response to TGF-h was strongly impaired (Fig. 4B).
These indicate that Smad2 and Smad3 act in a complementary
manner to degrade Ski. Altogether, these experiments show that
activation of Smad2 or Smad3 by TGF-h is necessary to induce the
proteasome degradation of Ski.
Arkadia is required for TGF-B–induced degradation of Ski.
Several E3 ligases, including Smurf1, Smurf2, Arkadia, and the APC/
Cdh1 complex, have been implicated in the regulation of TGF-h
signaling. To determine which E3 ligase is responsible for the
degradation of Ski, we examined the ability of overexpressed
Smurf1, Smurf2, Arkadia, and APC/Cdh1 to induce Ski degradation

in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of Smurf1, Cdh1,
and Arkadia strongly reduced the level of Ski, whereas Smurf2 did
not affect Ski stability. This indicates that Smurf1, Arkadia, and the
APC/Cdh1 complex are potential candidates to induce Ski
degradation. To address more directly which E3 ligase is recruited
on TGF-h stimulation to mediate Ski degradation, various siRNA
duplexes targeting Smurf1, Smurf2, Cdh1, or Arkadia were
introduced. Western blotting analysis confirmed effective knockdown of these cDNAs by the siRNA (Fig. 5B). In the absence of
TGF-h, none of the siRNA had any effect on Ski stability (Fig. 5B),
suggesting that none of the E3 ligases that we tested is implicated
in the regulation of the basal level of Ski expression. After 40 min of
TGF-h stimulation, Ski degradation was completely inhibited by
siRNA directed against Arkadia but not by the reduction of Smurf1,
Smurf2, or Cdh1 (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained in A375
melanoma cells (data not shown). These results suggest that
although Smurf1 and APC complex are capable of mediating Ski
degradation when overexpressed, under physiologic conditions
they are not the E3 ligases responsible for Ski degradation. These
experiments show that Arkadia mediates TGF-h–induced degradation of Ski in these cancer cell lines.
Smad2 and Smad3 cooperate with Arkadia to mediate TGFB–induced degradation of Ski. Ski is able to interact with Smad2,
Smad3, and Arkadia individually in the absence of TGF-h in
transfected cells (33, 43). Because all three molecules are required
for Ski degradation in cancer cell lines, we asked whether Smad2
and Smad3 could cooperate with Arkadia to degrade Ski. When
overexpressed, wild-type (WT) but not a mutant Arkadia lacking
the E3 ligase activity (C937A) was able to induce degradation of Ski
(Figs. 5A and 6A). In contrast, overexpression of either Smad2 or

Discussion
Although both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions have
been reported for Ski, its exact role in mammalian malignant
progression has not been fully defined. In this study, we report that
reducing Ski expression in breast and lung cancer cells does not
affect tumor growth but enhances tumor metastasis in vivo.
Consistent with this in vivo observation, expression of a panel
of metastasis-promoting genes was also up-regulated in tumor
cells with reduced Ski expression. Thus, in these cells, Ski seems
to have an antitumorigenic activity, implying that high levels of
Ski expression in metastatic human cancer cells may serve as a

by Western blotting using antibodies against Ski, phosphorylated Smad2,
Smad2, phosphorylated Smad3, Smad3, and a-tubulin.

Smad3 alone did not reduce Ski level. However, they strongly
enhanced the ability of Arkadia to degrade Ski (Fig. 6A). This
enhancing effect was dependent on the E3 ligase activity of Arkadia
as the Smad proteins failed to cooperate with the C937A mutant
Arkadia to induce degradation of Ski (Fig. 6A).
To further confirm the role of the Smad-Ski interaction in the
degradation of Ski, we examined the ability of Arkadia to degrade a
mutant Ski that has lost the ability to bind to the Smad proteins
(SkimS2/S3,S4W). This mutant could interact with Arkadia as
effectively as WT Ski (Fig. 6B). However, overexpressed Arkadia,
Smad2, and Smad3 failed to reduce the level of this Ski mutant
(Fig. 6C), confirming that interaction of Smads and Ski is required
for its degradation.
Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in response to TGF-h
stimulation is required for its nuclear translocation and activation.
We found that, when overexpressed in 293T cells, Smad2 and
Smad3 were phosphorylated at the COOH-terminal serine residues
(Fig. 6D). To determine whether this phosphorylation is required
for Arkadia-mediated degradation of Ski, the Smad3 3SA mutant
defective in phosphorylation was used. When overexpressed in
293T cells, Smad3 3SA did not cooperate with Arkadia to degrade
Ski (Fig. 6D). Thus, binding of phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 to
Ski is required to induce efficient degradation of Ski by Arkadia.

potential barrier for malignant progression. Understanding the
mechanisms by which tumor cells override the effects of Ski
and progress toward a metastatic state is of utmost importance.
Here, in this report, we provide evidence that TGF-h, a cytokine
that is often highly expressed in metastatic tumors, can induce
efficient Ski degradation in melanoma and breast cancer cells
through the specific recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Arkadia
in a Smad-dependent manner. This ability of TGF-h to induce
degradation of Ski could be an additional mechanism contributing to its prometastatic activity. Our work also suggested an
important physiologic context under which Ski degradation is
regulated by TGF-h.
Contrary to previously reported observations in avian embryo
fibroblasts, Ski had little effect on anchorage-independent growth
of human cancer cells or on the growth of s.c. tumors in vivo.
Instead, we found that Ski expression inhibits tumor metastasis.
This is different from the closely related SnoN protein, which has a
major effect on tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo (13). In
MDA-MB-231 cells that express high levels of both SnoN and Ski,
reducing SnoN alone is sufficient to fully block the anchorageindependent growth and tumor formation in nude mice, whereas
reducing Ski has no effect. Thus, although Ski and SnoN share
redundant functions to induce transformation and terminal
differentiation in avian embryo cells, our present study suggests
that Ski and SnoN may have different functions in human
tumorigenesis.
The inability of Ski to promote tumor growth and its inhibitory
activity on tumor metastasis in vivo bring forth the question of
whether Ski is an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. Presently, the
hypothesis that Ski behaves as an oncogene in human cells was
supported by studies indicating that the level of Ski expression
correlates with the progression of various human cancers, including leukemia, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma
(4–8). Inversely, the antitumorigenic activity of Ski is also

substantiated by the increased susceptibility of heterozygous
Ski knockout mice to chemical carcinogens (9), by this study, by
its chromosomal localization (10), and by a recent report showing
that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Ski in JygMC(A)
mammary carcinoma cells reduced its metastatic potential in vivo
(44). It is of interest to note that thus far the strongest support
for the pro-oncogenic activity of Ski is the ability of Ski to induce
transformation of avian embryo fibroblasts (3). It is possible
that Ski may be pro-oncogenic in development of tumors of mesenchymal origins, such as fibrosarcoma and liposarcoma, but antioncogenic in the development of epithelial-derived tumors.
Alternatively, Ski may exert different effects on different aspects
or stages of tumorigenesis. Clearly, the function of Ski in mammalian tumorigenesis is more complex than people thought before
and needs more investigations.
Ski is an important negative regulator of the Smad proteins.
Whether the antimetastatic activity of Ski is related to its ability to
inactivate the Smad proteins is yet to be determined. In the
microarray analysis, some metastasis- and EMT-related genes that
are regulated by Ski are also TGF-h–responsive genes (SLUG, TNC,
HMGA2, SPHK1, ADMATS1, and TIMP-3), whereas others have not
been reported to be regulated by TGF-h. Thus, the antimetastatic
activity of Ski may be related to both Smad-dependent and Smadindependent pathways.
The inhibitory activity of Ski on tumor metastasis indicates that
a mechanism to inactivate Ski must exist in metastatic tumor cells.
Indeed, we found that TGF-h can induce efficient degradation of
Ski through Arkadia. Although Ski degradation in response to TGF-h
has been reported before in transfected cells (34), this regulation
did not occur in all cell types, and the physiologic context under
which this regulation happens has not been defined. Our results
showed that degradation of Ski by TGF-h occurs in metastatic
breast cancer and melanoma cells and plays an important role in
promoting tumor metastasis. Overexpression of Arkadia has been

shown to induce degradation of Ski in transfected cells (33).
However, under similar overexpression conditions, several other E3
ligases (i.e., APC/Cdh1 and Smurf1) also have the same effect. Thus,
overexpression experiment alone is not sufficient to determine
which E3 ligase is responsible for Ski degradation under
physiologic conditions. Using the siRNA approach to reduce the
expression of endogenous E3 ligases, we showed that only Arkadia
is required for TGF-h–induced degradation of Ski. Furthermore,
using a Smad3 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by TGF-hRI
or a Ski mutant that cannot bind the Smad proteins, we found that
phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 cooperate with Arkadia to
degrade Ski. This is consistent with another report by Levy et al.
(32) who have shown recently that binding of phosphorylated
Smad2 or Smad3 to SnoN is required to induce an efficient
degradation of SnoN by Arkadia. Arkadia may also be part of a
larger complex that is formed on TGF-h stimulation. Recently,
Axin, a central scaffold in the Wnt pathway, has been found
to interact with Arkadia to enhance the degradation of Smad7
(45). It is possible that similar scaffold proteins may be required
for Arkadia-induced degradation of Ski. Our results show that
this regulation can occur in metastatic tumor cells and may play
an important role in allowing metastasis to proceed. Thus, our
study has revealed a proper biological context for Ski degradation
by TGF-h.

Arkadia has recently emerged as a major regulator of the TGF-h
signaling through its ability to induce degradation of multiple
negative regulators of the pathway, including Ski, SnoN, and
Smad7, as well as its ability to enhance transcriptional activation
by phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 through ubiquitination
(32, 33, 46, 47). Although the essential role of Arkadia in normal
development has been described (48, 49), its role in tumorigenesis
has not yet been defined. By targeting the expression of these
negative regulators of TGF-h signaling, Arkadia may enhance the
protumorigenic activity of TGF-h in tumor metastasis. Consistent
with this, expression of Arkadia was found to increase as renal
tubular cells undergo EMT in response to TGF-h (50). Future
studies will reveal its role in human carcinogenesis.
