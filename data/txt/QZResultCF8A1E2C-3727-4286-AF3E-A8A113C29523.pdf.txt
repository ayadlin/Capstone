Abstract
C57BL/6J mice carrying the Min allele of Adenomatous
polyposis coli (Apc) develop numerous adenomas along the
entire length of the intestine and consequently die at an early
age. This short lifespan would prevent the accumulation of
somatic genetic mutations or epigenetic alterations necessary
for tumor progression. To overcome this limitation, we
generated F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids by crossing C57BR/cdcJ and
SWR/J females to C57BL/6J Apc Min/+ males. These hybrids
developed few intestinal tumors and often lived longer than 1
year. Many of the tumors (24-87%) were invasive adenocarcinomas, in which neoplastic tissue penetrated through
the muscle wall into the mesentery. In a few cases (3%),
lesions metastasized by extension to regional lymph nodes.
The development of these familial cancers does not require
chromosomal gains or losses, a high level of microsatellite
instability, or the presence of Helicobacter. To test whether
genetic instability might accelerate tumor progression, we
generated Apc Min/+ mice homozygous for the hypomorphic
allele of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene (Nbs1 #B) and
also treated Apc Min/+ mice with a strong somatic mutagen.
These imposed genetic instabilities did not reduce the time
required for cancers to form nor increase the percentage of
cancers nor drive progression to the point of distant
metastasis. In summary, we have found that the Apc Min/+
mouse model for familial intestinal cancer can develop
frequent invasive cancers in the absence of overt genomic
instability. Possible factors that promote invasion include
age-dependent epigenetic changes, conservative somatic
recombination, or direct effects of alleles in the F1 hybrid
genetic background. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5768–75]

Introduction
Human colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in
the world. In the United States alone, 148,810 new cases and 49,960
deaths were expected in 2008 (1). Once a colorectal tumor has
metastasized to other sites, the prognosis is quite poor, because no

effective treatment of disseminated colon cancer has yet been
identified.
Three models have been proposed to explain the acquisition of
metastatic potential (reviewed in ref. 2). The predisposition
model states that the genetic composition of the host determines
whether a primary tumor metastasizes. By contrast, the initiation
model states that neoplastic cells within the primary tumor
have acquired mutations or other stable changes during the
early stages of tumorigenesis that eventually lead to metastasis.
Finally, the progression model states that a subpopulation of
neoplastic cells within a primary tumor sequentially acquires
genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, or both that drive
progression, culminating in metastasis. Note that these models
are not mutually exclusive (e.g., a combination of constitutional
allelic variants and acquired somatic mutations might be
required for metastasis). Also, each scenario likely requires time
to unfold.
Mouse models of hereditary human colorectal cancer have not
yet fully addressed the issue of metastatic potential because the
existing models do not consistently develop advanced cancers.
C57BL/6J (B6) mice carrying one of several different adenomatous
polyposis coli (Apc) mutations (Apc Min, Apc 580S, and Apc D716)
develop numerous adenomatous polyps (reviewed in ref. 3).
Plausibly, these tumors do not progress because the mice have a
shortened lifespan, owing to the heavy tumor load especially in the
small intestine. This barrier can be partially overcome by
introducing additional mutations. B6 Apc Min/+ mice lacking EphB2,
EphB3, or p53 activity as well as cis-compound Apc D716 Smad4 
heterozygotes develop invasive adenocarcinomas (reviewed in ref.
4). The frequency of invasive tumors in these models ranged from
5% to 55% when reported. Other models with low tumor
multiplicity, including Apc 1638N/+, Muc2 /, Apc loxP/+; CDX2P-NLS
Cre, Smad3 /, and Tgfb1/ ; Rag2 / mice, also develop
advanced cancers (5–9). Apc loxP/+; CDX2P-NLS Cre mice carry a
loxP-targeted Apc allele and the CDX2P-NLS Cre recombinase
transgene; expression of Cre recombinase in the colon results in the
loss of Apc activity and consequently the formation of tumors (5).
Again, the frequency of invasive tumors varies widely, ranging from
3% to 50% when reported. In Apc 1638N/+ and Smad3 / mice, the
cancers were reported to have metastasized, although the
penetrance of this phenotype in both cases was quite low (8, 10).
Here, we report a high frequency of invasive adenocarcinomas and
local metastases in long-lived Apc Min/+ mice. In contrast to the
multiply mutated mouse models, we have investigated the state of
the genome in adenocarcinomas that arise in the familial Min
setting. Finding no evidence for spontaneous genomic instability,
we have gone on to explore whether imposed genetic instability or

Long-lived Min Mice Develop Advanced Intestinal Cancers

Helicobacter infection can accelerate the age-dependent tumor
progression in this model.

Materials and Methods
Mice. All mice were investigated in the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer
Research under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin following Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. Two
types of F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids were produced by breeding C57BR/cdcJ (BR)
and SWR/J (SWR) females to B6 Apc Min/+ males. To test whether increased
genetic instability affected tumor progression, females carrying the
Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene (Nbs1 #B) allele were bred to B6
Apc Min/+ males and the resulting progeny with a mixed genetic background
of 129 and B6 alleles were intercrossed to generate Apc Min/+ mice with
0, 1, or 2 copies of the Nbs1 #B allele. Mice were genotyped at Apc and Nbs1
using a PCR assay as described previously (11, 12).
Ethylnitrosourea treatment. Mice ages between 45 and 75 days were
given either a single intraperitoneal injection of ethylnitrosourea or two
injections separated by 14 days. Each injection of ethylnitrosourea was
50 Ag/g body weight.
Helicobacter testing. Fecal pellets were collected and DNA was isolated
with spin columns using the Blood and Body Fluid protocol provided by
Qiagen. Samples were analyzed using the following PCR assay. The reaction
included 1 Amol/L each of Helicobacter genus-specific primers 5¶TATGACGGGTATCCGGC-3¶ and 5¶-ATTCCACCTACCTCTCCCA-3¶,
designed from conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene (13), 200 Amol/L
of each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, template
DNA, 1.25 units Taq polymerase, and distilled water in a total volume
of 25 AL. Reactions were heated to 94jC for 30 s once followed by 45 cycles
of denaturation at 94jC for 2 s, primer annealing at 53jC for 2 s, and
extension at 72jC for 30 s in a thermocycler (MJ Research PTC-100). Each
PCR was analyzed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide and photographed under UV light. The following controls were
included with each PCR run: no sample, a sample from a Helicobacterinfected mouse, and a sample from a Helicobacter-free mouse. Positive
samples contained a 375 bp band as confirmed with DNA molecular weight
standards.
Tumor scoring. All mice were sacrificed when moribund. The number of
desmoid fibromas on the abdominal wall was scored and the intestinal tract
was removed, opened longitudinally, and laid out as described previously
(14). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 16 h and then placed
in 70% ethanol for long-term storage. The number of intestinal tumors was
scored with a dissecting microscope by a single observer (R.B.H.) blind to
the genotype of the mice.
Histologic analysis. Intestinal tumors were embedded in paraffin,
sectioned, and stained with either H&E or h-catenin as described previously
(15). Sections were analyzed by three pathologists (H.C.P., M.K.W., and R.S.),
each blind to the genotype of the mice.
Genetic integrity. To determine the Apc status of intestinal tumors,
DNA was isolated from samples scraped from 20 to 40 paraffin sections
using neighboring H&E-stained sections as a guide. The Apc status
was ascertained using the Apc heterozygosity index as described previously (16).
To test for microsatellite instability (MSI), intestinal tumors and adjacent
normal tissue were microdissected during necropsy. Each tumor was cut
in half; one piece was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, whereas the other
piece was fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin for histologic analysis.
DNA was isolated from each frozen sample using the Magnesil Genomic
Fixed Tissue System from Promega and analyzed for MSI as described
previously (17).
Intestinal tumors, adjacent normal tissue, and kidneys were collected for
comparative genomic hybridization. Again, each tumor was divided so that
histologic analysis could be done. DNA from tissue that had been snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen was analyzed using FVB DNA as the reference as
described previously (18). Although tumors contain both neoplastic and

normal cells, our analysis of the Apc status in tumors by quantitative PCR
indicates that the normal cell admixture is <30%, so the comparative
genomic hybridization platform should permit any significant change in
copy number to be detected.

Results
B6 Apc Min/+ mice fail to develop invasive intestinal cancers
consistently, presumably owing to their short lifespan of f100
days. This limited time likely restricts the execution of each
conceivable pathway to metastasis. To test this possibility, we
generated Min mice with an extended lifespan. BR females were
crossed with B6 Apc Min/+ males and the resulting (BR  B6)F1
Apc Min/+ hybrids were held until moribund. The average lifespan of
these mice was 232 F 66 days, considerably longer than the average
lifespan of B6 Apc Min/+ controls (Fig. 1; Table 1A). The increase in
longevity was related to a dramatic reduction in tumor multiplicity:
(BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids developed, on average, 19 F 10
intestinal tumors, whereas B6 Apc Min/+ controls developed, on
average, 122 F 45 (Table 1A). Suppression of tumorigenesis was
evident along the entire length of the intestinal tract from the
duodenum to the descending colon (Fig. 2). This observation
indicates that the BR strain carries at least one dominant
modifying allele that suppresses tumorigenesis. The majority of
intestinal tumors (56%) from (BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids were
invasive adenocarcinomas (Fig. 3A; Table 1A). Longevity also
affects extracolonic lesions: (BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids
developed significantly more desmoid fibromas than B6 Apc Min/+
controls (data not shown).
The predisposition model states that metastatic potential is a
heritable trait influenced by genetic polymorphisms of the host. To
test whether the development of intestinal cancers was peculiar to
(BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids, we generated another group of F1
hybrids by crossing SWR females to B6 Apc Min/+ males. The
resulting (SWR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids had an average lifespan of
370 F 99 and developed, on average, 15 F 10 tumors along the
entire length of the intestinal tract (Fig. 1; Table 1A). This reduction
in tumor multiplicity was expected because SWR carries the
resistance allele of the Mom1 locus, which encodes the secretory
phopholipase A2 (19). Here too, the majority of tumors in (SWR 
B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids were invasive adenocarcinomas (Fig. 3A;

The small intestine was divided into four equal segments, with region 1 being
closest to the stomach and region 4 being closest to the cecum. The number of
tumors in these segments and the colon was scored and is plotted as the
percentage of the total. Interestingly, the distribution of tumors skewed toward
region 1 if F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids are treated with ethylnitrosourea (ENU ; P < 0.001

were harvested at necropsy. Thus, the development of invasive
cancers in Min mice is not peculiar to a particular strain. Rather, it
appears to depend on either the elapsed time of tumor
development or the age of the host—two intertwined variables in
these experiments.
We analyzed the status of the Apc wild-type allele in 10 advanced
tumors from F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids. The majority (8 of 10) exhibited loss, most likely by somatic recombination as in B6 Apc Min/+
mice. We did not analyze the status of Mom1. BR is closely related
to B6 and carries the sensitive allele of Mom1. Therefore, the
reduction in tumor multiplicity and increase in longevity exhibited by (BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids cannot be explained by
Mom1 status.
In the progression model, tumors grow and metastasize as a
consequence of accumulated genetic mutation, epigenetic alterations, or both throughout the genome. Tumors from F1 Apc Min/+
hybrids ranging in age from 232 to 609 days were tested for MSI
using a multiplex assay described previously (17). One F1
adenocarcinoma was MSI-high exhibiting mutations in 2 of
8 markers, whereas 13 F1 adenocarcinomas were MSI-low
exhibiting mutations only in 1 of 8 markers (Table 2). The majority
of the mutations were found in mBAT-67, a very long mononucleotide repeat marker that is likely to be less stable than
shorter mononucleotide repeat markers. Notably, the low level
of MSI observed in invasive adenocarcinomas from long-lived
F1 Apc Min/+ animals does exceed that observed in short-lived
B6 Apc Min/+ controls. Only 1 of 20 adenomas in B6 animals ranging
in age from 90 to 100 days was MSI-low. Thus, a low level of
MSI may participate in familial tumorigenesis, but it is not
measurably enhanced during progression to the adenocarcinoma.

Long-lived Min Mice Develop Advanced Intestinal Cancers

Tumors from F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids were also tested for
chromosomal deletions and gains by comparative genomic
hybridization. We prepared genomic DNA from invasive adenocarcinomas, normal intestinal epithelium, and kidney. A few clones

Tumors often exhibit ulceration of the mucosal surface and extensive invasion

appeared to have spread by direct extension into a regional lymph node. The
tumor, mesentery, and enlarged lymph node were removed, fixed in 10%
buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were assessed
by immunohistochemistry for overexpression of h-catenin (left) or stained with
H&E [middle; each area outlined with a black rectangle is shown enlarged (right)].
In this tumor, neoplastic cells have invaded into the muscle wall of the
gastrointestinal tract (B and C) and largely effaced and replaced normal tissue in
the lymph node leaving only residual intact areas (D). The cytoplasm and nucleus

on the arrays consistently exhibited a change in copy number
among all samples including normal tissue, indicating that they
were polymorphic between B6 and FVB (Fig. 4). However, no
tumor-associated aberrations were detected in the DNA from these
tumors. Thus, large chromosomal deletions or duplications are not
necessary for the progression of invasive adenocarcinomas in this
particular model of familial cancer.
Although apparently not necessary, chromosomal instability
might be sufficient to drive tumor progression in Min mice. Cells
homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of Nbs1, Nbs1 #B, exhibit
defects in the intra-S and G2-M checkpoints and marked
chromosomal instability (20). Nbs1 #B/#B p53 / mice develop
lymphomas much earlier than Nbs1 +/+ p53 / mice (12). We
generated Min mice carrying 0, 1, and 2 copies of the mutant
Nbs1 #B allele and held them until moribund. The significant
reduction in Nbs1 activity did not affect tumor progression: 21% of
the tumors in Apc Min/+ Nbs1 #B/#B mice and 12% in Apc Min/+
Nbs1 +/+ mice were invasive adenocarcinomas (Table 1B). Further,
no difference was observed in lifespan, tumor multiplicity
(Table 1B), or tumor distribution (data not shown). Thus, a reduction in Nbs1 activity does not strongly affect intestinal
tumorigenesis in the Min mouse. One explanation is that reduced
Nbs1 activity might not cause genetic instability in the intestinal
epithelium; this possibility has not been specifically tested.
Is genetic mutation sufficient to drive tumor progression in
Min mice? We treated F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids with one or two doses of
a strong somatic point mutagen. Mice received 50 Ag ethylnitrosourea/g body weight per intraperitoneal injection at ages
between 45 and 75 days and were held until moribund. We choose a
low dose of ethylnitrosourea in young adults rather than a high
dose because we wanted to avoid a dramatic increase in tumor
multiplicity and consequently reduced lifespan. Surprisingly,
treatment of (BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids appeared to impede
tumor progression, with only 9% of the tumors being invasive adenocarcinomas (Table 1C). This effect might simply reflect
the significant decrease in lifespan owing to the increase in
adenoma multiplicity. Treated mice developed, on average, 50 F 22
tumors, whereas contemporaneous controls developed 19 F 10
tumors. Ethylnitrosourea had its strongest effect in the proximal half of the small intestine (Fig. 2). In addition, treatment
of (SWR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids with ethylnitrosourea did
not increase tumor progression. Thus, this situation, designed to
increase the levels of somatic mutation during tumorigenesis,
clearly did not enhance tumor progression in the Min mouse.
The risk of developing intestinal cancer is clearly influenced by
environmental factors, including diet and bacterial flora. Several
epidemiologic studies indicate that risk of colon cancer is higher
for individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori. This link is also
apparent in some animal models: the development of intestinal
cancers in Smad3-deficient mice depends on the presence of
Helicobacter. To test whether age-dependent tumor progression in
Min mice was affected by Helicobacter status, we analyzed tumors
from F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids for which the status of Helicobacter was
known. No effect on the frequency of invasive adenocarcinomas
was observed between Helicobacter-negative mice and contemporaneous Helicobacter-positive controls (Table 1D).8

8
The frequency observed in this experiment was noticeably lower than that in the
initial experiment (Table 1D versus Table 1A). During the 6 years that elapsed between
these two experiments, our colony underwent significant environmental changes
including a switch in diet and the implementation of a microisolator system.

Discussion
We have identified a homogenous genetic and environmental
context in which Apc Min/+ mice develop intestinal tumors that
spontaneously progress and metastasize locally. A key barrier
to the development of advanced cancers in the Min mouse has
been the short lifespan on the sensitive B6 genetic background.
F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids were generated by crossing BR or SWR
females to B6 Apc Min/+ males. These mice developed one-tenth
the number of tumors observed in controls and often lived longer
than 1 year. Many of the tumors in these hybrids were invasive
adenocarcinomas and a few even metastasized by extension
into regional lymph nodes (Fig. 3; Table 1). The development of
these familial cancers did not require a high level of MSI,
chromosomal gains or losses, or the presence of Helicobacter.
Several classes of genomically conservative processes can be considered to drive progression in this setting. Prominent candidates can be suggested from the known epigenetic changes
observed by the analysis of the tumor transcriptome. We have
previously shown that advanced cancers from long-lived Min
mice exhibit core molecular signatures of the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition. In particular, vimentin expression is
elevated not only in neoplastic cells of the primary tumor but also

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

in those invading the submucosa and musculature (21). A full
characterization of the epigenome during tumor progression in
the Min model may identify other candidate genes whose
deregulation mediates progression.
The genomically conservative pathway to invasive intestinal
adenocarcinomas that we have observed in the familial Min model
does not rule out a role for genomic instability in other contexts
such as sporadic colon cancer. Indeed, mutations in several genes
have been shown to enhance the tumor phenotype of Min and
other mouse models. We have investigated whether a generalized
increase in somatic mutation can increase the number of invasive
adenocarcinomas and metastatic lesions as well as decrease the
time required for these types of tumors to form in the Min model.
We treated adult F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids with a low dose of
ethylnitrosourea and found that this treatment shortened the
lifespan, increased tumor multiplicity, and reduced progression.9

The increase in tumor multiplicity was unexpected, because our previous study
had found that treatment of young B6 Apc Min/+ adults with ethylnitrosourea failed
to affect tumor multiplicity (22). Key differences between this study and that of
Shoemaker and colleagues are genetic background (F1 versus B6) and the age at which
the treated mice were sacrificed (V100 versus 188 F 32 days).

Long-lived Min Mice Develop Advanced Intestinal Cancers

Figure 4. Invasive adenocarcinomas from
long-lived F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids do not exhibit
chromosomal instability. Two invasive
adenocarcinomas (A and B; bar, 2 mm), adjacent
normal tissue, and kidneys were removed from a
(BR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ male that lived for
312 d. DNA was prepared and analyzed by
comparative genomic hybridization (C ). The log2
ratio is plotted for each locus. None of the
autosomal chromosomes exhibited any gains or
losses when comparing results obtained with DNA
from tumors (red square and red triangle ) with those
obtained with DNA from adjacent normal tissue
(black diamond ). By contrast, the X chromosome
appears to be lost in all samples. This change merely
reflects the fact that test DNA for this example
was isolated from a F1 Apc Min/+ male and the control
DNA was isolated from a female. A total of seven
invasive adenocarcinomas from three F1 Apc Min/+
hybrids were analyzed. Similar results were
observed in all cases.

Thus, any molecular changes that occur spontaneously during
tumor progression cannot be fully replaced by treating mice with a
strong point mutagen. Perhaps, the salient changes are not point
mutations. Other possibilities will be discussed below.
Our results do not yet support a particular model of metastatic
potential. Consider the predisposition model. Both (BR  B6)F1
and (SWR  B6)F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids develop a significant number
of invasive adenocarcinomas. BR and SWR are quite distinct and
were derived from separate stocks in the 1930s and 1940s (23).
Nonetheless, these strains could share one or more allelic variants
that affect metastatic potential. The propensity for metastasis
must be mapped to particular host loci and tested by
transplantation for autonomy versus nonautonomy to investigate
this hypothesis. Lifsted and colleagues recently showed that the
development of mammary cancers and extensive metastasis in
mice carrying the (MMTV-PyMT)634Mul transgene was profoundly affected by genetic background (24). In addition, Park and
colleagues showed that resistant and susceptible strains can be
stratified based on the expression of 17 genes in normal
mammary tissue (25). Together, these findings have lent support
to the host predisposition model.
Constitutional polymorphic variants are known to affect other
aspects of intestinal tumorigenesis in the Apc Min/+ mouse model.
B6 Apc Min/+ mice develop, on average, 100 tumors, whereas AKR
Apc Min/+ mice develop, on average, <1 tumor (16). This difference is
partially due to Mom1, encoding Pla2g2a and at least one other
modifier of intestinal tumorigenesis (19). The reduction in tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

multiplicity does not necessarily lead to increased longevity
because AKR mice frequently develop lymphomas. Other polymorphic modifiers of the Min phenotype have been identified
including Mom2, Mom3, Mom6, and Mom7 (4). Mom2 is a
spontaneous mutation that maps to distal chromosome 18 and
disrupts Atp5a1, encoding the a subunit of the ATP synthase (26).
Mom7 maps to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 18 and
may directly regulate the loss of heterozygosity of distal elements
(27). The genome-wide identification of polymorphic modifier loci
for the Min phenotype is just beginning.
Somatic mutations also can affect intestinal tumorigenesis.
Armitage and Doll estimated that five to six changes are necessary
for a cancer to form (28). Analyses of human tumors at different
stages have revealed that the activation of KRAS promotes growth
and the loss of p53 favors metastasis. These alterations appear not
to occur spontaneously during the development of intestinal
adenomas and invasive adenocarcinomas in studies of two mouse
models (29, 30). Possibly, the context, for example, sporadic versus
familial disease or even the specific mutation in Apc, dictates
which pathway is favored. The possible role of somatic mutations
in progression in mouse models is suggested only by studies of
these models carrying germ-line mutations in loci other than Apc.
Janssen and colleagues showed that constitutional expression of
an activated form of KRAS does affect tumor multiplicity and
progression in Apc 1638N/+ mice (31). Nearly half of the tumors from
KRAS V12G; Apc 1638N/+ mice progressed to invasive adenocarcinomas
by age 105 days (16 of 34) unlike Apc 1638N/+ controls (1 of 8).

Similarly, we have shown that a lack of p53 activity leads to tumor
progression in the intestines of young Min mice (14). B6 Apc Min/+
p53 / mice developed a small proportion of invasive adenocarcinomas by age 90 days (2 of 42) in contrast to B6 Apc Min/+ p53 +/+
controls (0 of 78). Tumor progression in mouse models is also
affected by mutations in several other genes including Atp5a1
(Mom2), Ephrin A1, EphB2, EphB3, ERa , Fen1, Netrin-1, and Tsp1
(reviewed in ref. 4). The genome-wide identification of mutant
alleles that modify the Min phenotype is also just beginning.
Two pathways lead to genetic instability in colorectal cancer (32):
MSI and chromosomal instability. Alberici and colleagues reported
that adenomas in Apc 1638N/+ mice display numerous chromosomal
aberrations (33). Further, several investigators have found that
sporadic human colorectal tumors display numerous chromosomal
aberrations. For example, Martin and colleagues reported that
those chromosomal regions that had undergone amplification
and deletion carried known cancer genes including EGFR and Myc
and many of affected regions were also altered in lung cancers,
glioblastomas, or multiple myelomas (34). However, it remains a
challenge to determine whether the genetic and genomic instabilities observed in these advanced cancers are triggers rather
than bystanders acquired during growth under the relaxed constraints of the autonomous neoplasm. Thus, a chromosomal region
that is commonly altered may either carry a critical gene affecting
progression or else simply be inherently unstable in its structure.
Selection for genetic instability may be much stronger in
sporadic disease than familial disease. Some intestinal adenomas
from Apc Min/+ mice and familial adenomatous polyposis patients
have been reported to form with relatively stable karyotypes
(15, 35). Conservative somatic recombination at the Apc/APC locus
plays a role in the formation of these tumors. Two independent
studies have shown that a reduction in activity of the Bloom’s
syndrome gene (Blm) enhances the Min phenotype (36, 37). In both
cases, the analysis of markers on chromosome 18 revealed that the
wild-type allele of Apc was lost by somatic recombination in several
tumors. Haigis and Dove showed that the wild-type allele of Apc is
almost always lost by somatic recombination to initiate tumorigenesis in B6 Apc Min/+ mice (38). They found the Robertsonian
translocation Rb(7.18)9Lub reduces the multiplicity of intestinal
adenomas in this mouse model by disrupting the pairing of the
chromosome 18 homologues during mitosis. The extent of somatic
recombination throughout the entire genome is unknown.
Interestingly, McMurray and Gottschling showed that wild-type
yeast cells switch to a hyperrecombinational state as they age (39).
Loss of heterozygosity occurs by somatic recombination in young
cells and by break-induced replication in old cells. These forms of
genetic instability would not be detected by comparative genomic
hybridization because copy number is unaltered. Thus, somatic
recombination in tumors of F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids could generate
homozygosity for allelic variants that drive progression, culminating in metastasis. We did find loss of heterozygosity at the Apc
locus in the majority of advanced tumors from F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids.

By contrast, epigenetic silencing may play a role in the formation
or progression of these genetically stable neoplasms. Silencing may
be reflected by the CpG island methylator phenotype (reviewed in
ref. 40). Intriguingly, DNA hypermethylation is an age-dependent
process in the intestinal epithelium (41, 42).
In summary, we have tested invasive adenocarcinomas from
long-lived F1 Apc Min/+ hybrids for chromosomal instability and
MSI. Overall, the tumors in this particular model of familial
disease display a stable karyotype and only a low level of MSI.
These invasive tumors can metastasize by extension into regional
lymph nodes. Bodmer and Tomlinson have argued that genetic
instability is not required for tumor development because normal
mutation rates coupled with selection are sufficient to account
for the molecular changes observed (43, 44). Thus, although
genetic instability may be able to drive progression in some
biological contexts, it is not the only route to the locally invasive
adenocarcinoma. Rusan and Peifer have reviewed the possible
positive and negative effects of genomic instability on cancer (45).
Indeed, genetic instability can inhibit tumorigenesis in certain
other biological contexts by triggering apoptosis (46). Rao and
colleagues have reported that the lack of mitotic aberrations in Min
mice reduces tumor multiplicity in the small intestine but increases
it in the colon (47).
The genetically conservative pathway to invasion described in
this report must now be analyzed more deeply by newly emerging
methods. Does the development of invasive potential reflect
the elapsed time of tumor development or the age of the host?
Longitudinal studies of individual tumors arising at different times
in an animal may enable one to disentangle these two factors. Does
it reflect an accumulation of conservative somatic recombination
events that render particular constitutional alleles homozygous in
F1 Apc Min/+ animals? Does it reflect an age-dependent epigenetic
silencing of one or both alleles at particular anti-progression loci?
The capacity of the Min mouse model to display a high frequency
of locally metastatic behavior represents another step in the
development of better animal models for human colon cancer.
