ABSTRACT
The 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) is a non-integrin receptor for laminin (LM)
that derives from a 37 kDa precursor (37LRP). 67LR expression is increased in
neoplastic cells and correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic potential.
We used structure-based virtual screening (SB-VS) to search for 67LR inhibitory
small molecules, by focusing on a 37LRP sequence, the peptide G, able to specifically
bind LM. Forty-six compounds were identified and tested on HEK-293 cells transfected
with 37LRP/67LR (LR-293 cells). One compound, NSC47924, selectively inhibited LR293 cell adhesion to LM with IC50 and Ki values of 19.35 and 2.45 μmol/L.
NSC47924 engaged residues W176 and L173 of peptide G, critical for specific
LM binding. Indeed, NSC47924 inhibited in vitro binding of recombinant 37LRP to
both LM and its YIGSR fragment. NSC47924 also impaired LR-293 cell migration to
LM and cell invasion.
A subsequent hierarchical similarity search with NSC47924 led to the
identification of additional four compounds inhibiting LR-293 cell binding to LM:
NSC47923, NSC48478, NSC48861, and NSC48869, with IC50 values of 1.99, 1.76, 3.4,
and 4.0 μmol/L, respectively, and able to block in vitro cancer cell invasion.
These compounds are promising scaffolds for future drug design and discovery
efforts in cancer progression.

probably by fatty acid acylation. 37LRP is mostly found
in the cytosol [9] and nucleus [10] where it is involved
in translational processes and maintenance of nuclear
structures, respectively. 67LR is localized at the cell
surface [11] and it not only serves as a receptor for LM
but also acts as a receptor for elastin [12], carbohydrates
[13] and the cellular prion protein [14].
67LR binds LM through different binding domains:
a palindromic sequence known as peptide G [11, 15], a
predicted helical domain corresponding to 37LRP residues
205–229, and TEDWS-containing C-terminal repeats

INTRODUCTION
The 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) was originally
identified as a non-integrin cell surface receptor for LM
[1], the major component of basement membranes [2].
Interactions between 67LR and LM play a major role in
mediating cell adhesion [3], migration [4], proliferation
and survival [5].
67LR derives from homo- [6] or hetero- [7] dimeri­
zation of a 37 kDa cytosolic precursor (37LRP) [8], most

[13]. 67LR is co-expressed and can physically interact
with the α6 integrin chain [16]. LM conformation changes
upon binding 67LR, thus interacting more efficiently with
integrins [17] and becoming more sensitive to the action
of proteolytic enzymes [18], with the release of motility
fragments [19].
67LR expression is increased in neoplastic cells
as compared to their normal counterparts and directly
correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic
potential [20], mediated by high-affinity interactions
between 67LR and LM [21].
Cell adhesion to the basement membrane allows
tumor cells to secrete proteolytic enzymes, i.e. type
IV collagenase, able to degrade components of the
extracellular matrix (ECM). Degradation of these
components, in turn, induces invasion of the basement
membrane, enabling cancerous cells to migrate and form
metastasis. Thus, 67LR overexpression is a molecular
marker of aggressiveness in cancers of many tissues,
including breast, lung, ovary, prostate and also in
leukaemia and lymphomas [22–24].
The correlation between 37LRP/67LR levels
and tumor aggressiveness recommends the receptor as
a new promising target for cancer treatment. This is
supported by in vivo studies showing that high 67LR
levels result in tumor growth and proliferation [25,
26]. Knockdown of 37LRP using siRNAs resulted in
decreased cell survival suggesting that 37LRP/67LR
could also enhance cell viability by blocking apoptosis
[27]. Indeed, we recently demonstrated the structural
and functional association of 67LR with the antiapoptotic protein PED/PEA-15 [28]. Furthermore,
recent findings demonstrated that an anti-37LRP/67LR
specific antibody significantly impeded angiogenesis,
thus suggesting the receptor might also be involved in
tumor angiogenesis [29].

However, an anti-37LRP/67LR specific antibody
decreased the invasive potential of human fibrosarcoma cells
[30], thus indicating that 67LR plays a critical role in tumor
invasion and metastasis through its interaction with LM.
The 2.15 Å resolution crystal structure of the
partial domain of human 67LR [31] provides an excellent
platform for rational drug design. For these reasons, we
used structure-based virtual screening (SB-VS) [32] of
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set with
nonredundant structures to identify small molecules
targeting 67LR and able to disrupt cell binding to LM. SBVS, which uses computer-based methods for identifying
promising compounds to bind to a target molecule of
known structure, is a widely used method that has been
shown to be successful in a variety of studies, although it
also has many shortcomings [33].
Here, we describe the successful outcome of this
search and the initial biological evaluation of the most
promising compounds from this effort.

RESULTS
Identification of a druggable pocket within the
human 67LR structure
Recently, the structure of the N-terminal of 37LRP
(residues 1–220) has been solved by X-ray crystallography
[31] with resolution of 2.15 Å (Protein Data Bank ID code
3BCH) (Figure 1A). 37LRP was shown to have a globular
structure comprising five α-helical and seven β-folded
regions. This structure shows a high degree of similarity to
ribosomal protein SA or p40 from prokaryotes and lower
eukaryotes [9, 34]. Since 37LRP crystal structure begins at
residue 9 (Q9; single-letter amino-acid code) and finishes
at residue 205 (R205) (both indicated on the Figure 1A), it
lacks almost all the C-terminal domain, not present in the

Figure 1: Structure of human 37LRP. A. Structure of human 37LRP represented as a slate blue cartoon. The structure begins at

residue Q9 and finishes at residue R205, lacking almost all the C-terminal LM-binding site, which starts at residue R205. Peptide G
(residues 161–180) is shown in yellow. The surface loop (residues 187–205), which covers the palindromic sequence of peptide G, is
shown in magenta. B. Structure of human 37LRP lacking of the surface loop. The palindromic sequence of peptide G (LMWWML) is

prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic ribosomal proteins [35],
which starts at residue 205.
Among the different 67LR binding sites for LM,
we focused on peptide G for the abundant clinical and
experimental data indicating its critical role in tumor
invasion and metastasis [11, 15, 17–21]. Peptide G
(residues 161–180, IPCNNKGAHSVGLMWWMLAR)
binds LM with high affinity (Kd = 51.8 nM) [11, 15,
17]. Moreover, evolutionary studies suggested that the
acquisition of the LM-binding capability of 67LR is linked
to the palindromic sequence LMWWML contained within
the peptide G [35]. Peptide G forms part of a β-strand
(residues 160–162), an α-helix (residues 168–186) and a
surface loop (residues 187–205), much of which is buried
in the interior of the molecule. The only portion of it that
is solvent-accessible includes residues 165–169.
The crystal structure of 37LRP reveals that the
surface loop completely covers the palindromic sequence
of peptide G, making it inaccessible to binding of LM
(Figure 1A); thus, it has been postulated that considerable
conformational changes are required to enable LM
binding. Indeed, we found that loop 188–197 in the
C-terminal region is highly flexible and undergoes a major
change resulting in a conformational switch that partially
solvent exposes the final part of peptide G [36].
Thus, with the aim of exposing the palindromic
sequence (Figure 1B) involving protein-LM interactions,
we truncated the surface loop of 37LRP (residues 187–205)
from the available crystallographic structure. One cavity was
intercepted in close proximity of the palindromic residue
W176. This groove lies between two α helices (αC and αE)
and covers a surface area of 2265 Å2 (Figure 1C). The site is
predominantly hydrophobic in nature (L173, M174, M177,
L178, A86, G172, A93, A179, G172, A168, F90, W175,
W176) with a few H-bond donors and acceptors. This putative
cavity, that we hypothesize to be involved in LM binding, was
chosen for in silico targeting in a SB-VS approach.

the ligands. The 188 ranked compounds were analyzed
by visual inspection because it has broadly demonstrated
that docking scoring functions are often more successful at
predicting a binding pose than the actual binding affinity
[38]. Finally, compounds were checked for readily sample
availability from the compound provider, and 46 structurally
diverse compounds (compounds 1-46 in Chart 1 of
Supplementary Material: SB-VS selected small molecules
directed to the peptide G cavity of 67LR) were requested
and tested in a cell-based assay.

Human 37LRP cDNA transfection in HEK-293
cells results in cell surface expression of the active
receptor and increased cell adhesion to LM
As a model to mimic the effects of 67LR
overexpression in cancer cells, HEK-293 cells were
stably transfected with a human 37LRP cDNA fused at the
C-terminal with a tag derived from phage T7 and a polyhistidine stretch (LR-293 cells) or with an empty vector
(V-293 cells).
37LRP expression was then evaluated by Western
blot analysis, using an anti-37LRP/67LR polyclonal
antibody and an anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody, in
V-293 and LR-293 cell lysates. LR-293 cells expressed
both endogenous and transfected 37LRP (37LRP/T7tag),
whereas V-293 cells expressed only endogenous 37LRP
(Figure 2A).
To verify that transfected 37LRP was correctly
processed into the mature form and over-expressed at
the cell surface, flow cytometry analysis was performed
on V-293 and LR-293 cells with the same polyclonal
antibody. LR-293 cells showed increased 67LR surface
expression in respect to V-293 cells (Figure 2B).
Finally, 67LR overexpressed on LR-293 cell surface
was functionally active; indeed, LR-293 cell adhesion to
LM was significantly increased, as compared to V-293
cells, and such an increase was completely abrogated
by cell pre-treatment with anti-37LRP/67LR polyclonal
antibodies (Figure 2C).

Identification by SB-VS of small molecules
directed to the peptide G cavity of 67LR
An in silico screening approach was undertaken to
identify compounds from the NCI Diversity library with a
potential to bind at the putative cavity on the peptide G of
67LR and hamper LM binding. 3D structures of compounds
from the NCI’s chemical libraries were downloaded from
the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program web site
(http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/dscb/repo_open. html/)
and processed with LigPrep software to produce 2, 560 3D
structures for the Diversity Set. Docking calculations were
carried out by using the Glide software [37]. Then, Glide SP
docked each chemical structure into the 67LR/LM binding
site retaining the 10% of the top-scoring ligands. The
resulting 188 compounds were then redocked and scored
with Glide XP in order to estimate binding affinity and rank

Cell adhesion to LM of 67LR overexpressing
cells is inhibited by SB-VS selected compounds
To identify potential molecules able to inhibit
67LR binding to LM, LR-293 cells were subjected to
adhesion experiments on LM-coated wells in the presence
of the 46 initial hits, dissolved in DMSO and added at a
concentration of 2×10–5 M; DMSO alone was used as a
negative control.
Among the 46 candidates, only five compounds
(Table 1) were able to inhibit LR-293 cell adhesion to LM
(Figure 3A). Moreover, all these compounds satisfy the
druglikeness rules defined by Qikprop (QikProp, version
4.1, Schrödinger, LLC).

analysis of the GraphPad Prism software (Figure 3C). Ki of
NSC47924 was 2.45 μM, as calculated by the Cheng and
Prusoff Equation from EC50, using GraphPad Prism [39].
LR-293 cell adhesion to increasing concentrations
of LM in the presence of NSC47924 at its IC50 was also
evaluated. In the absence of inhibitors, LR-293 cell
adhesion to LM showed a Kd of 14.5 nM, similar to
that already reported for in vitro 67LR binding to LM
[2 nM; ref. 40]; the addition of NSC47924, at its IC50,
resulted in a significant loss of LR-293 cell binding to
LM (Figure 3D).

To verify their specificity, the five active compounds
were tested for the ability to inhibit LR-293 cell adhesion
to LM, FN and VN. Only one compound selectively
inhibited LR-293 cell adhesion to LM. This molecule,
NSC47924 [1-((4-methoxyanilino)methyl)-2-naphthol],
strongly and specifically decreased cell binding to LM
without significantly affect cell adherence to FN and VN
(Figure 3B). On the contrary, the other compounds also
inhibited cell binding to VN and FN (not shown) and were
withdrawn from the study for their lack of specificity.

NSC47924 specifically inhibits 67LR-mediated
cell adhesion, migration and invasion

NSC47924 inhibits cell binding to LM in a
dose-dependent manner with a micromolar affinity

67LR mediates high affinity interaction between
cells and LM, thus increasing cell migration and
invasiveness in overexpressing cells [21, 22–24, 30];
therefore, it was investigated whether NSC47924 was
able to specifically inhibit 67LR-mediated cell adhesion
and migration to LM and basement membrane invasion in
LR-293 cells, using V-293 cells as a control.

LR-293 cell adhesion to LM was also evaluated in
the presence of decreasing concentration of NSC47924,
in order to evaluate the dose-dependency of its inhibi­tory
activity. IC50 value was 19.35 μM, as calculated by nonlinear regression curves using the sigmoidal dose-response

To this aim, in vitro adhesion and migration assays to
LM as well as Matrigel invasion assays were performed, in
the presence or in the absence of 20 μM NSC47924. 67LR
overexpressing LR-293 cells showed increased adhesion
to LM, migration toward LM and Matrigel invasion, as
compared to V-293 cells (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C). NSC47924
significantly inhibited LR-293 cell adhesion/migration to
LM and invasion, as compared to vehicle treated cells; no
significant effect was observed on V-293 cells (Figure 4A,
4B, 4C). NSC373070, an inactive compound derived from
the 46 initial hits (Chart 1 of Supplementary Material),
was added as a negative control and was ineffective in
inhibiting LR-293 cell adhesion/migration to LM and
Matrigel invasion, as expected (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C).
Thus, a novel small molecule specifically inhibiting
cell binding to LM and its functional effects in 67LR
overexpressing cells was identified by SB-VS.

specificity, r37LRP binding to BSA-coated wells was
also evaluated in parallel and the OD readings subtracted.
r37LRP specifically bound to LM, albeit with a lower
efficiency than 67LR overexpressing cells, showing a
Kd of 1.9 μM (Figure 5A), similar to that reported for a
truncated form of 37LRP [2.3 μM; ref. 41].
Then, NSC47924 ability to inhibit r37LRP binding
to LM was evaluated. NSC47924 inhibited r37LRP
binding to LM, showing a IC50 of 58.9 μM and a Ki of 35.5
μM (not shown). Thus, NSC47924 is a specific inhibitor of
37LRP/67LR direct binding to LM (Figure 5B).
The precise contact site on LM for 67LR have
not been mapped yet. However, it is believed that the
interaction involves a specific peptide from the β1 chain
of laminin (YIGSR) [42]; the binding activity of this
synthetic peptide is increased by an amide group at the
C-terminal [3]. Moreover, YIGSR is able to displace
peptide G from LM, thus blocking the peptide G-mediated
increase in LM degradation [18–19]. For these reasons,
we investigated whether NSC47924 was able to compete
for r37LRP binding to YIGSR. NSC47924 significantly
inhibited r37LRP binding to YIGSR (Figure 5C), leading
us to hypothesize that our target sequence, peptide G,
could be effectively addressed by NSC47924.
Docking experiments were performed to gain insight
into the possible mechanisms of interaction between
NSC47924 and peptide G of 37LRP. As shown in Figure 5D,
the naphthol ring of the ligand is sandwiched between two
α-helices (αC and αE) of 37LRP and held in place by a H-bond

To further demonstrate the specificity of 37LRP/67R
as a target, the ability of NSC47924 to inhibit the binding
to LM of human recombinant soluble 37LRP (r37LRP)
was evaluated.
In order to demonstrate r37LRP ability to bind
LM, serial dilution of purified His-tagged r37LRP was
incubated on wells pre-coated with LM, and binding
was detected by anti-His HRP. As a control for binding

Modes of binding for the top five inhibitors
of 67LR

compounds, which we docked to the putative cavity found
in close proximity of 37LRP crystal structure and ranked
according to predicted binding energy. The top 19 compounds
based on a binding energy cutoff of –7 kcal/mol were selected
for experimental testing (compounds 47–65 in Chart 2 of
Supplementary Material: Refinement of lead 67LR inhibitor
NSC47924).
The 19 top-ranked compounds identified in the
similarity screen were tested at 20 μM concentration by in
vitro cell adhesion assay to LM. Eight compounds were able
to inhibit the adhesion of LR-293 cells to LM (Figure 6A),
but only four of them, NSC47923 [1-(4-toluidinomethyl)2-naphthol], NSC48478 [1-((4-chloroa­nilino)methyl)2-naphthol], NSC48861 [1-((((2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)
methyl)-4-methylanilino)methyl)-2-naphthol]
and
NSC48869 [1-((((2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)methyl)anilino)
methyl)-2-naphthol] (Table 2) selectively inhibited LR-293
cell binding to LM without exerting a significant effect on
cell binding to FN.
To also demonstrate the specificity for 67LR as
a target, selected analogs were tested for their ability
to inhibit the direct r37LRP binding to LM. NSC47923,
NSC48478, NSC48861 and NSC48869 were active to
the same extent as NSC47924, by in vitro binding assays
(Figure 6C).

IC50 values lower than NSC47924, when tested at
decreasing concentrations on LR-293 cell adhesion
assays (Table 2).

The five micromolar drug-like inhibitors
of 67LR that we have identified, all share a core
1-(anilinomethyl)-2-naphthol scaffold, which is pre­
dicted to bind in the deep putative 37LRP binding cleft
(Figure 7). The core scaffold, including the H-bonding
interaction with the carbonyl backbone of G172,
conserves many protein-ligand interactions previously
described for NSC47924 (Figure 5D). The naphthol
moiety preserves hydrophobic interactions with F90,
W175, A86, G172, W176, A93, and A179 residues,
whereas the p-substituted phenyl ring maintains
hydrophobic and aromatic π-stacking interactions with
the palindromic residues W176 and L173. However,
the differences of the p-substituents account for a
large difference in activity. NSC47924 is 9.7-fold and
10.9-fold less active than NSC47923 and NSC48478,
respectively. This suggests that the unfavourable steric
interactions of the bulky methoxy group of NSC47924
and the K17 side chain would be removed by the less
sterically demanding methyl group (NSC47923) and
chlorine atom (NSC48478). The additional 2-naphtol
ring in both NSC48861 and NSC48869 establishes
favorable hydrophobic contacts with residues G172,
L173 and H169, allowing the exploration of a rather
lipophilic region of 67LR. One can speculate that
specific ligand interactions with this region of the

highlighting an increased in vivo activity, as compared to
NSC47924 (Figure 4C), most likely due to their lower IC50

the 19 top-ranked compounds identified in the similarity
screen (Chart 2 of Supplementary Material), was added
as a negative control and was ineffective in inhibiting
Matrigel invasion, as expected (Figure 8A, 8B).

these two compounds at 67LR.

NSC47923, NSC48478, NSC48861 and
NSC48869 inhibit tumor cell invasion
It has been widely reported that 67LR enhances
cancer cell invasion and tumor metastasis by engaging
LM and promoting ECM breakdown and the release of
LM-derived motility fragments [18, 19].
Therefore, we sought to investigate whether
selected compounds were able to inhibit the invasion
through reconstituted basal membranes of highly invasive
human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and human breast cancer
MDAMB231 cell lines, constitutively expressing high
67LR levels [30, 43].

in comparison to experimental high-throughput screening
(HTS), thereby coming to the forefront in the modern drug
discovery process [32]. There are two fundamental types
of VS applications: structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) and ligand-based virtual screening (LB-VS). SB-VS
uses the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of
the target to select candidates most likely to interact with
the binding site of the target [33], while LB-VS employs
information of the known active compounds as a search
query to retrieve the potential actives from large chemical
libraries [44]. The main advantages of SB-VS methods
compared to LB-VS methods are the structural novelty
of the hits discovered (not based on pre-existing, known
ligands) and the possibility to model the binding mode of
potential ligands within the binding site.
Availability of large number of protein targets in
cancer offers an excellent opportunity to carry out VS. In
cancer research, successful VS strategies to identify novel
hits have been reported by various groups [45]. However,
identified hits cannot directly enter into clinical trials,
but may serve as starting point for further optimization.
Therefore, the VS route of cancer drug discovery provides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an excellent opportunity to save time and money, bringing
down the cost.
67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) overexpression
correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic
potential in many human tumors [22–24] recommending
the receptor as a new promising target for cancer drug
discovery [25]. This is supported by in vivo studies
showing that 67LR downregulation by antisense RNA
reduces tumor cell proliferation and tumour formation
[46]. Our group recently demonstrated that, upon LM
binding, 67LR association with the anti-apoptotic protein
PED/PEA-15 activates a signal transduction pathway,
leading to cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis
[28]; indeed, siRNA mediated 67LR downregulation
reduces cell viability by inducing apoptosis [27].
However, the main function of 67LR is to enhance
tumor cell adhesion to the LM of basement membranes
and cell migration, two crucial events in the metastasis
cascade [20, 21]. Thus, inhibiting 67LR binding to LM
could be a feasible approach to block metastatic cancer
cell spread. Recently, several studies have shown that anti37LRP/67LR specific antibodies significantly reduce the

invasive potential of HT1080 fibrosarcoma, lung, cervical,
colon, prostate, breast and oesophageal cancer cells [30,
43, 47], thus indicating that 67LR plays a critical role
in tumor invasion and metastasis through its interaction
with LM. Furthermore, 67LR interaction with LM might
also be involved in angiogenesis [48] and recent findings
suggest that the same anti-37LRP/67LR antibody is also
able to block angiogenesis [29].
Thus, the main goal of our study was to identify
small molecules able to inhibit 67LR interaction with
LM. In our search for active compounds, we reviewed
biological and biochemical data to identify a significant
67LR binding site for LM to target. We focused on the
37LRP-derived “peptide G” sequence (residues 161–180,
IPCNNKGAHSVGLMWWMLAR) that binds LM with
high affinity (Kd = 51.8 nM) [11, 15, 17], elutes 67LR from
LM affinity chromatography columns [17], and mediates
many functional effect linked to tumor progression, such
as increased cell adhesion and migration to exposed ECM
[18], increased tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells
and metastasis formation [15] and release of motility
fragments from LM [19].
Interestingly, the mature 67LR originates from a
ribosomal protein that acquired the LM binding function
during evolution. Indeed, both human 37LRP and the p40
ribosomal protein are encoded by the same gene [9, 10].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sequence conservation of 37LRP/p40 genes across species
has been demonstrated, with evolution of the C-terminal
tail, where is located the LM binding function, convergent
with vertebrates [35]. Evolutionary studies also showed
that the acquisition of LM-binding capability is linked to
the palindromic sequence LMWWML contained within
peptide G, which appeared during evolution concomitantly
with LM or LM-like molecules. This consistent with the
observation that two consecutive tryptophan residues are
often associated with protein-protein interaction [49].
The fact that specific amino acid/s could be
responsible for the functionality of the complex between
67LR and LM increased the possibility that a small
molecule could exert a disrupting effect. Although an
antibody and a peptide could also be able to target such
interaction, we believe that a small molecule with the same
activity would be preferable. Since disruption of LM/67LR
interaction should block tumor cell invasion rather than
cause cell death, to be an effective treatment, the drug
would have to be used chronically in patients suspected to
have overt disseminated or residual disease. A successful
outcome implies prolonged treatments and thus the need for
a drug with oral availability and high index of specificity for
cancer cells. Because the library was selected on the basis
of Lipinski’s rule for drug-like properties [50], and because
of the target, which is an interaction that takes place when

± SD of three experiments carried out in triplicate; (*, P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 ), as determined by the Student’s t test. FBS-induced cancer
cell invasiveness was significantly reduced by compounds NSC47923, NSC48478, NSC48861, NSC48869, at both concentrations tested.

67LR is over-expressed, a condition of malignant tumors,
those two requirement should be satisfied.
The crystal structure of 37LRP reveals that the
surface loop of residues 187–205 completely covers
peptide G, making it inaccessible. Thus, to expose the
palindromic sequence, we truncated the surface loop of
37LRP and intercepted a hydrophobic cavity in close
proximity of the palindromic residue W176. This putative
cavity was chosen for in silico targeting in a SB-VS
approach, which has already been used to successfully
identify small molecule inhibitors of urokinase receptor
(uPAR) [51], Cdc25B dual specificity phosphatases [52]
and frataxin ubiquitination [53].
This approach led to the identification of a small
molecule, NSC47924, with 67LR/LM disrupting activity.
Since, small molecules have a higher likelihood for
off-target effects (based on non-selectivity) in respect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to protein-like biologicals [54], we demonstrated that
NSC47924 reduced adhesion and migration to LM
as well as Matrigel invasion of 67LR-overexpressing
cells, without exerting any significant effect in vectortransfected cell, poorly expressing 67LR.
NSC47924 is expected to reduce cancer cell spread,
rather than cause acute cancer cell death; however, we
cannot exclude that NSC47924 can diffuse through the
cell membrane, or be internalized upon 67LR binding, and
thus exert also a role on cell proliferation and survival by
targeting cytosolic, ribosomal and/or nuclear 37LRP.
Indeed, one of the most important advantages of
small molecules, in respect to monoclonal antibodies, is
cell membrane permeability. Moreover, the short half-life
of small molecules may be of considerable clinical benefit
in tailoring personalized target therapies in cancer, as it is
emerging in rheumatology [55].

SB-VS protocol

Hierarchical screening over the full NCI database
with NSC47924, molecular docking studies and cell
adhesion experiments identified four NSC47924 related
compounds, NSC47923, NSC48478, NSC48861 and
NSC48869, that showed increased 67LR inhibition ability,
as compared to NSC47924.
In summary, we combined SB-VS experiments
with in vitro assays and found five active molecules that
were able to selectively disrupt the 67LR/LM activity
in a timely and cost-effective fashion. In particular, we
have identified a specific inhibitor of cell binding to LM,
NSC47924, which is cell-permeable and selectively target
67LR-mediated cell adhesion, migration and invasion as
well as four its close analogs (NSC47923, NSC48478,
NSC48861 and NSC48869), even more active. This
specificity, together with its simple chemical structure,
make this compound class suitable for further development
of novel therapeutics for the treatment of 67LR-dependent
human malignancies.

The Glide v6.4 (Glide, version 6.4, Schrödinger,
LLC) [37] VS application in Schrödinger Small-Molecule
Drug Discovery Suite was used to screen the compound
library using two levels of docking precision. In the first
step, Glide was run in Standard Precision (SP) mode. The
10% of the top-scoring ligands (188 compounds) were kept
and redocked using the Glide Extra Precision (XP) mode,
which incorporates a more accurate, finer-grained docking
algorithm, designed to eliminate false positives that survive
the SP stage. After visual inspection of the top ranked
compounds, 46 hits were chosen for biological evaluation.
The grid for docking studies was chosen sufficiently
large to enclose all residues involved in the palindromic
sequence of peptide G (LMWWML) within a cubic box of
dimensions 40 Å × 40 Å × 40 Å. The enclosing box was
centered on the palindromic sequence setting the bounding
box with the sizes of 14 Å × 14 Å × 14 Å. A van der Waals
radius scaling factor of 0.80 for atoms with a partial atomic
charge (absolute value) less than 0.15 was used in order
to soften the potential for nonpolar parts of the receptor.
Compounds identified by SB-VS were flexibly docked
using the same protein grid prepared for SB-VS protocol.
Ten poses were collected for each ligand and ranked
according to predicted Glide XP score.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Computational chemistry
Molecular modeling and graphics manipulations
were performed using Maestro (Maestro, version 9.9,
Schrödinger, LLC) and Pymol [56] software packages
running on a E4 Computer Engineering E1080
workstation provided of a Intel Core i7–930 Quad-Core
processor.

Hierarchical similarity search
An online search utility provided by the NCI
(http://129.43.27.140/ncidb2/) was used to search the
entire NCI database for compounds similar to NSC 47924.
Two methods were used to judge compound similarity:
search on the basis of substructure by SMILES string
(http://daylight.com) and/or similarity by Tanimoto
coefficient, [58] with a cutoff of 0.85 [59]. From these
searches, selected compound structures were docked to
the putative LM binding pocket and ranked according to
predicted Glide XP score. Compounds with the lowest
scoring value were requested and assayed for effect on
cell adhesion inhibition.

Protein preparation
The X-ray coordinates of the 37LRP fragment
(PDB code 3BCH) [31] were extracted from the Protein
Data Bank [57]. The structure was then prepared using the
Protein Preparation Wizard of the Schrödinger graphical
interface Maestro. X-ray water molecules and surface loop
domain (residues 187–205) were removed during protein
preparation, the last step of which was energy minimization
of the entire structure. The minimization was terminated
when the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the heavy
atoms in the energy minimized structure relative to the
starting (X-ray) coordinates exceeded 0.3 Å.

Chemical inhibitors
All compounds identified by SB-VS were obtained
from the NCI/DTP Open Chemical Repository (http://dtp.
cancer.gov), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
stored at –20°C, at a concentration of 0.01 M.

Ligand preparation and filtering
3D structures of NCI Diversity Set (1, 990
compounds) were extracted by the web site http://
dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/dscb/repo_open.html/
and
prepared using LigPrep’s ligand preparation protocol
(LigPrep, version 3.1, Schrödinger, LLC). So, about
2, 560 structures including stereoisomers, tautomers,
and ionization states were ready to be submitted to the
subsequent docking runs.

Western blot with a polyclonal anti-37LRP/67LR antibody
or with non-immune immunoglobulins (Igs) (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, England), as decribed [23, 60].

Cell adhesion assay
The adhesion assays were carried out on 96-well
flat-bottomed plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated
with 1 μg of laminin (LM) (Becton Dickinson Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), fibronectin (FN) (Roche,
Indianapolis, USA), vitronectin (VN) (Becton Dickinson

PBS, as a negative control, as described [23, 28, 60, 61].
A binding curve and Kd were generated for compounds
using GraphPad Prism software.

Cell cultures and transfections
The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293
(ATCC Certified from LGC Standards, Milan, Italy) was
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
5 × 106 HEK-293 cells, cultured overnight in 100
mm tissue culture dishes, were stably transfected with 10
μg of pPLR2.5, or pcDNA3 and 60 μl of LipofectAMINE
(Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37°C (5% CO2). Transfected cells,
named LR-293 and V-293 respectively, were selected by
Geneticin (GIBCO) at 1.5 mg/ml, pooled, and cultured in
the presence of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin.
67LR highly expressing HT1080 fibrosarcoma [30]
and MDAMB231 breast cancer cell lines [43] were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

Cell migration and invasion assays
Cell migration assays were performed in Boyden
chambers using 8 μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVPF)-free chemotaxis filters (Wathman Int., Kent, UK),
coated with 50 μg/ml collagen, as an adhesion substrate.
V-293 and LR-293 cells (2 × 105) were plated in the upper
chamber in DMEM 0.1% BSA containing the selected
small molecules or DMSO, as a vehicle control. DMEM
0.1% BSA alone or containing 50 μg/ml LM was added in
the lower chamber and the cells were allowed to migrate
for 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.
For the invasion assay, filters were coated with
50 μg/ml MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
and incubated for 30 min at 37°C for gelling. 2 × 105
cells, plated in the upper chamber in DMEM 0.1% BSA
containing the selected small molecules or DMSO,
were allowed to migrate toward DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FCS, or toward DMEM medium
supplemented with 0.1% BSA, as a control, for 18 h at
37°C, 5% CO2.
At the end of both experiments, cells on the lower
surface of the filter were fixed in ethanol, stained with
hematoxylin, and counted at 200× magnification (10
random fields/filter). Cell migration and invasion were
expressed as a percent increase over the control.

Production of recombinant 37LRP and
anti-67LR antibodies
A recombinant polypeptide was made in bacteria for
production of anti-37LRP/67LR antibodies, as described [23].

Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface molecules
was performed as previously described [59].

with wash buffer (0.5% Tween in PBS). Penta-His HRP
conjugate (1:500) (Qiagen) was added for 2 h at room
temperature. After washing, substrate solution was added
and absorbance was detected at 490 nm on an ELISA
plate reader (Bio-Rad). Binding affinity was determined
by subtracting background absorbance (BSA wells). A

GraphPad Prism software. The Kd was calculated using
a one-site binding hyperbola and the equation Y = Bmax ×
X/(Kd+X).
For inhibition experiments, wells precoated with
