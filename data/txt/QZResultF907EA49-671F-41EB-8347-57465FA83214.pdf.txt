Abstract
Loss of PTEN and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are
commonly observed in advanced prostate cancer. Inhibition
of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream
target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling, results in cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple in vitro and in vivo
models of prostate cancer. However, single-agent use of mTOR
inhibition has limited clinical success, and the identification
of molecular events mitigating tumor response to mTOR
inhibition remains a critical question. Here, using genetically
engineered human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), we show
that MYC, a frequent target of genetic gain in prostate cancers,
abrogates sensitivity to rapamycin by decreasing rapamycininduced cytostasis and autophagy. Analysis of MYC and the
mTOR pathway in human prostate tumors and PrEC showed
selective increased expression of eukaryotic initiation factor
4E–binding protein 1 (4EBP1) with gain in MYC copy number
or forced MYC expression, respectively. We have also found
that MYC binds to regulatory regions of the 4EBP1 gene.
Suppression of 4EBP1 expression resulted in resensitization
of MYC-expressing PrEC to rapamycin and increased autophagy. Taken together, our findings suggest that MYC
expression abrogates sensitivity to rapamycin through increased expression of 4EBP1 and reduced autophagy. [Cancer

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death among men
in the United States. Most prostate cancer deaths are due to
advanced disease that is refractory to existing treatments. PTEN is
a tumor suppressor gene that is often lost in advanced prostate
cancer, resulting in constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. PI3K pathway subsequently activates
multiple downstream targets, including AKT1 and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), and promotes cell growth and
inhibits apoptosis.
The importance of the PI3K-AKT1-mTOR pathway in tumor
progression has been elegantly shown in vivo using transgenic

mouse models. Loss of PTEN or expression of activated AKT1 leads
to malignant or precancerous lesions in mouse prostate, respectively. Treating transgenic mice expressing myristoylated AKT1
under a probacin promoter with RAD001 (a rapamycin analogue)
for 2 weeks reverses the PIN phenotype, a precancerous lesion of
the prostate (1). This dramatic effect of mTOR inhibition reversing
the neoplastic phenotype is also observed in transgenic mice with
selective prostate knockout of Pten (2). Thus, mTOR inhibition
with rapamycin or rapamycin analogues is effective in PI3K-driven
prostate cancer models.
mTOR signaling is mediated primarily through two multiprotein
complexes (TORC1 and TORC2; reviewed in ref. 3). TORC1 includes
mTOR, raptor, and mLST8 (also known as GhL; refs. 4–6). When
activated, TORC1 phosphorylates two primary downstream
effectors, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1
(4EBP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1; refs. 7–9).
Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 results in the release of eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E and increased cap-dependent translation of a
set of proteins involved in G1-S-phase progression including cyclin
D and MYC (10, 11). Phosphorylation of S6K1 results in the
phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 and the
enhancement of translation of mRNAs that possess a 5¶-terminal
oligopyrimidine tract (12, 13). The TORC2 complex is composed of
mTOR, rictor, and mLST8 and has been shown to phosphorylate
AKT1 (14) and paxillin (15) among others. Although mTOR is
activated in many human cancers, the relative biological importance of TORC1 and TORC2 activity in human cancers remains
unknown.
The drug rapamycin binds to a cellular protein FKBP12, and this
complex inhibits the TORC1 complex. Despite the dramatic effects
observed after treatment of cells in tissue culture and transgenic
animals with rapamycin and rapamycin derivatives, limited clinical
efficacy of single-agent mTOR inhibition has been observed in
advanced prostate cancer. Here, we used genetically engineered
prostate epithelial cells and found that MYC expression profoundly
reduces sensitivity to rapamycin. Importantly, MYC copy number
gain is associated with increased 4EBP1 expression in human
prostate tumors, MYC binds to regulatory regions of the 4EBP1
gene, and MYC increases 4EBP1 expression and decreases
autophagy. Suppression of 4EBP1 resensitized cells to rapamycin
and resulted in less autophagy. In fact, 4EBP1 expression limits
autophagy induction by at least two inducers: rapamycin and
tunicamycin. Thus, MYC overexpression is associated with
increased 4EBP1 expression and decreased autophagy, which may
play a role in limiting the clinical effectiveness of single-agent
rapamycin or rapamycin analogues.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and medium. Prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP,
and PC3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells
were grown in RPMI (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum. This medium
was supplemented with 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1 Ag/mL plasmocin. Genetically engineered cell
lines including PrEC, LHS, LHSR, LHSR-AR, BH10i-AR, and LHMB-AR were
created and propagated as described previously (see Supplementary Table 1
for specific genetic constitution of each cell line; ref. 16). The prostate
epithelial cells were incubated at 37jC and 5% CO2 in PrEGM with defined
supplements as recommended (Cambrex).
Retroviral infection. Retroviruses were created as described previously
(17) with minor modifications. 293 EBNA packaging cell lines were
transfected with each of three plasmids containing (a) the Gag and Pol
genes, (b) the VSV envelope protein gene, and (c) a pWZL retroviral vector
containing the gene of interest using FuGENE 6 [3:1, volume (AL) to weight
(Ag) ratio]. Packaging cell lines were transfected twice separated by 24 h;
virus was harvested 36 to 48 h following the second transfection. Viruscontaining medium was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min at 4jC, filtered
(45 Am pore size; AStar), mixed with 10% growth medium and 4 Ag/mL
polybrene, and placed on cells. The retroviral supernatant was removed
24 h later, cells were cultured for another 24 h in normal growth medium,
and selective medium containing the appropriate agent (blasticidin or
puromycin) was added. Lentiviral infections were done following a similar
protocol to the retroviral infections. Lentiviral packaging vectors (pLKO
system) were obtained from Addgene (Trono Laboratory). short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) construct against 4EBP1 in lentiviral vector was from the
RNAi Consortium (Broad Institute).
Plasmids and bacteria. All plasmids were propagated in DH5a
Escherichia coli bacteria (Invitrogen) in Luria-Bertani growth medium
(Fisher Scientific) and grown at 37jC. The vector backbone pWZL was
obtained as pWZL-MYC from Addgene (18). The enhanced green fluorescent
protein insert was from pEGFP-C1 (BD biosciences). The shRNA construct
against MYC, sh3.1, was a gift from Joseph Nevins (Duke University) and is in
pRETROSUPER (19).
Drug sensitivity assay. Rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and a PI3K inhibitor
(BEZ235; Novartis) were used in prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, and
LNCaP) as well as in genetically engineered cell lines to determine the
sensitivity of the cells to the two drugs using a propidium iodide–based cell
cytotoxicity assay (20). Cells were plated at a density of 5,000 per well in
100 AL tissue culture medium. Serial dilutions of the drug at varying
concentrations were added in a volume of 100 AL the next day, one set of
plates is taken out at this point as a time 0 control, and plates are incubated
for 4 to 5 days after which they are removed from the incubator and frozen
at 80jC. At least 12 h after being frozen, the plates were thawed, 50 AL
(stock 200 Ag/mL) of propidium iodide were added to each well, and plates
were incubated for 1 h in dark. Fluorescent readings were measured with
a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) with excitation at 530 nm and
emission at 590 nm wavelengths. Proliferation was normalized to the no
drug control and plotted against increasing drug concentration using
Microsoft Excel software. Inhibitory concentrations were obtained using
GraphPad to obtain a nonlinear regression curve fit to calculate the EC50
(Prism Software).
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Cells were solubilized in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (supplemented with mini
cocktail EDTA free proteinase inhibitors; Roche). Adherent cells were
washed in ice-cold PBS twice and harvested using a cell scraper. Cells were
resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (supplemented
with mini cocktail EDTA free proteinase inhibitors; Roche). When
rapamycin and BEZ235 were used to investigate the effect on protein
phosphorylation, cells were starved for 48 h in 0.2% serum-containing
medium (or PrGEM that has only 1/50th of the recommended supplements)
and released in medium containing 10% serum for 30 min before protein
isolation. Protein lysates (25 Ag/sample) were separated on precast gradient
gels (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane
(Immobilon-P). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for

1 h and hybridized to primary antibodies in TBS-Tween 20 overnight at 4jC.
Membrane was washed in TBS-Tween 20 for 5 min three times and
incubated in secondary antibody anti-mouse or anti-rabbit linked to
horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000) for 1 h. Following five washes of 5 min
each, membrane was processed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence
Western Blotting Reagents (Amersham, GE Healthcare) and exposed to
film (Hyblot CL, Denville Scientific). The following primary antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: LC3B, pS6, total S6, pAKT1
(Ser473), total AKT1, p4EBP1, total 4EBP1, eIF4E, and caspase-3. The
antibodies against c-MYC and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
and the antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was from Upstate
Biotech. The secondary antibodies were either horseradish peroxidase–
linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse both from Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were grown at low density on plates and
rapamycin was added at different concentrations and exposed for different
periods. When harvesting cells, culture medium was saved and spun to
preserve floating and loosely attached cells. Attached cells were detached
using trypsin and all cells for each treatment were collected in a 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube and spun at 2,000 rpm for 2 min. Cells were washed in
PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and resuspending in ice-cold Nuclear Isolation
Medium (0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NP-40 in PBS) containing
5 Ag/mL propidium iodide and 100 Ag/mL DNase-free RNase. Cell cycle
phases in 5,000 to 10,000 cells were determined by flow cytometry at the
Duke Flow Cytometry Facility.
RNA expression and tissue microarrays. Deidentified local prostate
cancer specimens were analyzed under an institutional review board–
approved protocol (Duke institutional review board 6679-04EX). PrEC cell
lines and tumor specimens were processed for hybridization to Oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix U133A) using standard methods (17, 21).
Gene expression was determined from the CEL files using RMA with
background correction and quantile normalization (22, 23). Expression of
MYC, mTOR, 4EBP1, S6, S6K, and AKT was determined using gene-specific
probes on the U133A microarray.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for a subset of the samples for
which frozen tissue was available for microarray analysis was used to create
tissue microarrays. MYC copy number gain was determined using
fluorescent in situ hybridization as described previously (24).
Nonparametric tests were used to determine statistical significance of
differences between cell lines (Mann-Whitney) or correlation between the
expression of specific genes (Spearman’s rank statistic).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as described previously (19). Briefly, 10%
formaldehyde solution was added to cells for 15 min to crosslink DNAprotein complexes. Isolated nuclear chromatin extracts were sonicated and
incubated overnight at 4jC with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
with either 5 Ag anti-c-MYC or 2.5 Ag normal rabbit IgG. This was followed
by incubation with 20 AL protein A agarose beads (Roche) for 3 to 4 h at
4jC. After extensive washing, DNA fragments were harvested by de-crosslinking the immunoprecipitates. Real-time PCR using SYBR Green Master
Mix (Qiagen) and the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System was
used for quantitative analysis of the recovered DNA fragments from
chromatin immunoprecipitation including regions of 4EBP1, ALB, and
ODC1 (see Supplementary Table S2 for primer sequences). Relative
occupancy of the MYC transcription factor at the different E-boxes were
estimated by comparing its occupancy at the albumin promoter following
methods described previously (25). The chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays were done at least three times for each cell line.
Autophagy assays. Cells were grown in 10 cm plates in the presence of
absence of rapamycin or tunicamycin for 24 h and harvested for analysis.
For Western blots, cell lysates were separated using PAGE (as described
above) and hybridized to an antibody for LC3B type II (Cell Signaling
Technology) at 1:1,000 to detect autophagosome formation. For flow
cytometry, cells were exposed to 1 Ag/mL acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 20 min, trypsinized, and resuspended in growth medium. Approximately
20,000 cells were analyzed using the PerCP-Cy5.5-A channel with a BD FACS
Canto II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. For fluorescent microscopy, cells
were grown on tissue culture–treated chamber slides (BD Falcon) and

MYC Mitigates Rapamycin Induced Autophagy
exposed to rapamycin or tunicamycin for 24 h. The cells were briefly
exposed to 1 Ag/mL acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min and
examined under a microscope without fixation. All images were acquired
using an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope and Photometrics Cool Snap
HQ camera connected to a Deltavision RT Restoration Imaging System
(Applied Precision). Images were acquired using the 20 Uplan SApo
objective (0.75 NA) and the Deltavision SoftWoRx Resolve 3D capture
program and collected as a stack of 0.2 to 0.5 Am increments in the z axis
(15-35 sections). Images were deconvolved using the conservative algorithm
with 5 to 10 iterations. Deconvolved images were saved as separate
z-sections or viewed as stacked (collapsed) images using the Quick
Projection option. Images were then imported to Adobe Photoshop for
presentation.

Results
Genetic determinants of prostate cell sensitivity to
rapamycin. Prior studies (26) have shown that the PTEN status
of established prostate cancer cell lines affects sensitivity to
rapamycin; PTEN wild-type cells (DU145) are less sensitive than
PTEN-null cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
However, the marked aneuploidy present in these established
cancer cell lines (27–29) precludes refined analysis regarding
specific interactions between genetic events and sensitivity to
rapamycin. Therefore, genetically engineered immortalized and
tumorigenic human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC; ref. 16) were
tested for rapamycin sensitivity. In these cell lines, neither
activated H-Ras nor the androgen receptor (AR) significantly
altered PrEC sensitivity to rapamycin (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast, the expression of MYC resulted in
marked resistance to rapamycin (Fig. 1A and B). In multiple
experiments, the EC50 for rapamycin was the same for cell lines
with differential expression of RAS (LHS EC50 0.18 F 0.11 nmol/L
versus LHSR EC50 0.21 F 0.16 nmol/L; mean F SD) or AR (LHSR
EC50 0.21 F 0.16 nmol/L versus LHSR-AR EC50 0.16 F 0.14 nmol/L),
whereas there was f10-fold difference in the EC50 between cell
lines with differential expression of MYC (BH10i-AR EC50 0.23 F
0.060 nmol/L versus LHMB-AR EC50 2.13 F 1.963 nmol/L;
P = 0.0286, Mann-Whitney exact). Although MYC is known to be

an important downstream target of mTOR-mediated regulation of
cap-dependent translation (11), the ability of MYC to abrogate
sensitivity to rapamycin has not been previously described.
Altering MYC levels in established prostate cancer cell lines
mimics the effects seen in the PrEC. MYC expression also affects
rapamycin sensitivity in established prostate cell lines (PC3, DU145,
and LNCaP). Consistent with our findings in PrEC, overexpression
of MYC resulted in decreased sensitivity to rapamycin in LNCaP
and DU145 (Fig. 2A and B). Increased expression of MYC in PC3
had minimal effect on rapamycin sensitivity and we note that
baseline expression of MYC in PC3 is higher than DU145 and
LNCaP (Fig. 2A). RNA interference–mediated suppression of MYC
increased rapamycin sensitivity in all three cell lines tested (Fig. 2C
and D). Altering MYC in the established cell lines affected the
growth kinetics of each cell line independent of rapamycin
exposure. To ensure that MYC activity rather than a change in
cell growth altered rapamycin sensitivity, we tested a range of
serum deprivation conditions to identify a concentration of serum
that resulted in an equivalent reduction in cell growth as seen with
MYC knockdown. PC3 cells growing in 2.5% serum had an
equivalent reduction in cell growth as seen with MYC knockdown
(f70%) but were not more sensitive to rapamycin (data not
shown). Overall, altering MYC expression in established prostate
cancer cell lines consistently altered sensitivity to rapamycin albeit
less dramatically as in the genetically engineered PrEC cell lines.
MYC alters rapamycin-induced cytostasis and autophagy. In
previous reports, mTOR inhibition with rapamycin has been found
to cause cytostasis (1), apoptosis (1), and/or autophagy (30). In the
PrEC cell lines, the effect of MYC appears to be primarily through
decreased rapamycin-induced cytostasis and autophagy rather
than apoptosis. In the BH10i-AR cells, rapamycin treatment results
in a marked cytostasis with a decrease in the percentage of cells in
the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3A). Expression of MYC
abrogates the rapamycin-induced cytostasis. The effect of MYC was
not due to apoptosis as rapamycin failed to induce apoptosis in
either BH10i-AR or LHMB-AR cell lines as detected by proteolytic
cleavage of caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S2A) or poly(ADPribose) polymerase (Supplementary Fig. S2B), although MYC

expression did decrease the sub-G1 population of cells (the ‘‘M1’’
gate in Fig. 3A) with or without rapamycin. The specificity of the
observed effect of MYC on rapamycin sensitivity is supported by a
failure of activated H-RAS in the PrEC to have a similar decrease in
rapamycin-induced cytostasis (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Cells detected to be in G1-G0 may simply be in a state of
dormancy (e.g., G0) but they can exhibit alternative behaviors such
as autophagy. In the PrEC, MYC expression decreased autophagy
as measured by acridine orange staining, flow cytometry, and
LC3B Western blot (Fig. 3B) and limited the increase in autophagy
following treatment with rapamycin (Fig. 3B-D). Coincident
exposure to bafilomycin A1 decreased baseline autophagy and
eliminated rapamycin-induced autophagy. MYC expression also

limited autophagy caused by tunicamycin, a frequently used agent
that reliably causes autophagy through inhibition of GlcNAc
phosphotransferase and inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis, a
mTOR-independent process. However, we did not see a difference
in autophagy induction between the PrEC cell lines with and
without MYC expression using Earle’s BSS, N-acetylsphingosine, or
lithium chloride (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Analysis of the expression of downstream mTOR components
in vitro and in vivo in genetically engineered prostate epithelial
cells and prostate tumors. After establishing an association
between MYC activity and rapamycin sensitivity, we sought to
investigate how MYC, a transcription factor, may affect the mTOR
signaling cascade. To identify mTOR target proteins that may have
altered expression due to MYC, we analyzed transcriptional microarray data derived from the PrEC cell lines and a set of prostate
tumors for which we have microarray data and tissue microarrays.
First, we used gene expression profiles from the PrEC to
determine if mTOR, S6K, 4EBP1, or AKT1 were differentially
expressed in the presence or absence of MYC. In PrEC lines of
different genetic constitutions, 4EBP1 was specifically overexpressed in cells expressing MYC and not altered by any other
genetic manipulation (Fig. 4A). MYC, however, did not affect the
expression of S6K, mTOR, or AKT1.
Next, we tested if genetic gain of MYC in prostate cancer tumors
was associated with increased expression of mTOR and/or target
proteins. Using a set of 50 tumors for which both tissue
microarrays and expression data were available, MYC copy number
was definitively established in 21 specimens by fluorescent in situ
hybridization (Fig. 4B, left) and transcriptional microarray analysis
was used to determine expression of specific mTOR targets. Here,
although the number of samples with gain in MYC copy number
was relatively small (n = 6), 4EBP1 had increased expression in
prostate tumors with increased MYC copy number compared with
samples that were diploid for MYC (P = 0.0091; Fig. 4B, right).
In addition, in a larger number of prostate cancer samples, MYC
RNA expression significantly correlated with 4EBP expression
(Spearman r = 0.453; P = 0.0391), whereas there was no correlation
between MYC and mTOR (Spearman r = -0.229; P = 0.316;
Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Thus, in genetically engineered cell lines and localized prostate
cancer specimens, there is a consistent correlation between MYC
and increased expression of 4EBP1 that was not apparent with
other target proteins of mTOR.
MYC binds to E-box sequence adjacent to 4EBP1 gene.
Given the correlation between MYC copy number gain and
4EBP1 expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
to determine if MYC binds to regulatory regions of the 4EBP1 gene.
One E-box sequence was identified immediately upstream of the
4EBP1 transcriptional start site and two additional E-box
sequences were identified within the first intron of 4EBP1 (see
schema in Fig. 4C). In LHMB-AR, there was strong relative
occupancy of E-boxes 1 and 2 when compared with an unrelated
albumin promoter region but no occupancy of E-box 3 (Fig. 4C).
MYC occupancy of E-boxes 1 and 2 was greater in LHMB-AR than
MYC occupancy of an E-box adjacent to the ornithine decarboxylase gene, which is a well-characterized direct MYC target (31).
MYC also occupied E-box 1, E-box 2, and the E-box adjacent to
ornithine decarboxylase in the BH10i-AR cell line but at much
lower relative occupancy (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Binding of
MYC to E-boxes 1 and 2 was also observed in the established
prostate cancer cell line PC3, although relative MYC occupancy was

MYC Mitigates Rapamycin Induced Autophagy

somewhat lower than at the ornithine decarboxylase gene (Fig. 4C).
Thus, MYC likely increases 4EBP1 expression through direct
transcriptional regulation.
MYC expression increases expression of 4EBP1 protein. We
next investigated MYC-induced changes in the protein expression
and phosphorylation status of mTOR target proteins in the
genetically engineered prostate cell system. When the expression
and phosphorylation of S6, 4EBP1, and AKT1 were assessed, we
found a marked increase in total 4EBP and p4EBP in the LHMB-AR
cells, whereas total S6 and pS6 levels did not change and AKT1 was
only modestly increased (Fig. 4D). In the PrEC, rapamycin
significantly decreases phosphorylation of S6 and increases
phosphorylation of AKT1 but had limited effect on 4EBP
phosphorylation in MYC-expressing cells. This pattern appears to
be specific to mTOR inhibition with rapamycin, as inhibition of
both PI3K and mTOR with BEZ235 inhibited phosphorylation of all
three proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). The increase in
protein expression of 4EBP1 with MYC overexpression is also
observed in PC3 cells, an established prostate cancer cell line

(Supplementary Fig. S4C). In addition, levels of eIF4E were
consistent despite increased MYC expression and increased
4EBP1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4D), suggesting that along
with increased total levels of 4EBP1 there was also an increase in
the ratio of 4EBP1 to eIF4E.
4EBP1 suppression resensitizes MYC-expressing PrEC to
rapamycin and increases autophagy. The strong association
between MYC and 4EBP1 expression suggests that MYC may confer
increased resistance to rapamycin through increased 4EBP1
expression. Although 4EBP1 does not coimmunoprecipitate with
the TORC1 complex in the PrEC and established prostate cancer
cell lines (data not shown), we remained interested in determining
if decreasing 4EBP1 would alter rapamycin sensitivity in PrEC with
high MYC expression. To test this, 4EBP1 was targeted with a
shRNA in LHMB-AR PrEC. Although suppression of 4EBP1 had no
effect on LHMB-AR cell growth, the cells became significantly more
sensitive to rapamycin (Fig. 5A).

normal medium and incubated for 48 h in medium equivalent to serum-starved conditions and then transferred to normal medium for 30 min with or without rapamycin.

knockdown of 4EBP1 affected autophagy. Importantly, decreased
4EBP1 expression resulted in increased baseline levels of autophagy
based on lipidation of LC3B and acridine orange fluorescence
(Fig. 5B-D). Indeed, whereas LHMB-AR cells expressing a lentivirus
expressing a scrambled shRNA construct had baseline levels of
autophagy similar to that of uninfected LHMB-AR, the LHMB-AR
cells in which 4EBP1 expression was suppressed exhibited
increased baseline levels of autophagy. Importantly, suppression
of 4EBP1 also increased rapamycin- and tunicamycin-induced
autophagy (Fig. 5D). Thus, 4EBP1 expression appears to have
significant effect on autophagy, both baseline levels and selected
inducers of autophagy including rapamycin.

Discussion
The PI3K pathway remains a promising target for therapeutic
intervention in prostate cancer given the high frequency of PTEN
loss. Indeed, recent findings from comprehensive cancer genome
sequencing projects suggest that the PI3K pathway is frequently
activated in breast cancer (32), pancreatic cancer (33), and
glioblastoma (34). Although mTOR inhibitors have shown outstanding preclinical activity in prostate cancer models dependent

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

on activation of the PI3K pathway, the limited clinical activity of
mTOR inhibition observed in prostate cancer has been disappointing. Although it has been shown that feedback loops through
insulin-like growth factor receptor-I and mitogen-activated kinases
play a role in resistance to mTOR inhibitors, our work suggests that
expression of MYC, a target of gain or amplification in 20% to 30%
of advanced prostate cancer (35–37), may also account for the
limited activity of mTOR inhibition in prostate cancer.
Although MYC has a myriad of transcriptional targets and
profound effects on cell biology, our work identifies 4EBP1 as a
novel target of MYC through which MYC activity affects the
response to rapamycin. 4EBP1 is believed to primarily control capdependent translation by binding and inactivating eIF4E; phosphorylation of 4EBP1 results in the release of eIF4E and subsequent
activation of the eIF4G scaffolding protein (38). Thus, it is unclear
how increased expression of p4EBP1 results in decreased
rapamycin sensitivity. Recent work suggests that 4EBP1 may also
have a positive effect as p4EBP1 can bind to and stabilize TORC1
in vitro (39). Our work suggests that 4EBP1 may have as yet
unrecognized actions that affect mTOR signaling and/or autophagy. Indeed, the effect of 4EBP1 on autophagy was significant, as
cell lines with 4EPB1 knockdown displayed increased baseline

levels of autophagy, increased rapamycin induced autophagy,
and increased tunicamycin-induced autophagy and the effect of
4EBP1 was abolished in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor
bafilomycin A1. The consistency of these findings suggests that
4EBP1 may interact with specific proteins involved in autophagy;
the subsequent discovery of how 4EBP1 affects autophagy has the
potential to provide new insight as to the role of 4EBP1 in cellular
physiology and cancer.
Our discoveries of the significant effect of MYC on rapamycin,
the effect of MYC on 4EBP1 expression, and the effect of 4EBP1 on
autophagy suggest that these proteins and the process of autophagy
are important to the response of prostate tumor to mTOR
inhibition. However, the results from established prostate cancer
cell lines and 4EBP1 knockdown experiments suggest that the effect
of MYC on rapamycin sensitivity is not entirely explained by the
increased expression of 4EBP1 and/or the modulation of autophagy.
It is likely that MYC has additional roles that affect a cell’s sensitivity

to mTOR inhibition and we did note modest increase in pAKT with
increased MYC expression, suggesting that TORC2 activity may also
be affected. Fortunately, using a recently described dual PI3K and
mTOR inhibitor, the effect of MYC on sensitivity is eliminated.
Coincidently, BEZ235 dramatically reduces p4EBP and pAKT and
increases autophagy and may prove to be a more effective, MYCindependent therapeutic strategy in advanced prostate cancer.
Our work provides a specific example of how confounding genetic
events can affect the efficacy of a targeted therapy. As comprehensive genomic analyses for each of the major tumor types become
available, work such as that presented in this article will provide a
means to understanding how the co-occurrence of specific genetic
events may affect a patient’s response to a given targeted therapy.
The use of genetically engineered cells can help identify specific
modulating genetic events that are important to consider when
choosing therapy for individuals with cancer. Our results suggest
that the limited clinical efficacy of mTOR inhibition in prostate
