ABSTRACT
The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1053239 and rs2479 of
cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its
components, and with the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs
was investigated. Totally 1064 subjects with metabolic syndrome and 1099 controls
of Chinese Han nationality were recruited. Clinical assessment was conducted with
medication records collected at baseline and during 5-year follow-up. Carriers of
rs2479 A allele were at higher risk to develop elevated fasting glucose than noncarriers (P = 0.004). A allele at rs2479 were associated with a 5-year aggravation of
blood triglyceride (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.003), and C allele at
rs1053239 with the exacerbation of systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure
(P = 0.001). Moreover, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of angiotensin II-targeted drugs
were higher in subjects with rs2479 A allele or rs1053239 C allele. These findings
suggest that carriers of rs2479 A allele are predisposed to the development of increased
fasting glucose, and the progressive elevation of blood triglyceride. Individuals with A
allele at rs2479 or C allele at rs1053239 are more susceptible to a rapid progression
of blood pressure, and benefit more from angiotensin II-targeted therapy.

INTRODUCTION

The lipid droplet-associated protein cell deathinducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) has gained
increasing attention as a vital regulator in lipid and glucose
metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It was implicated to
facilitate adipocytes differentiation [6] and repress lipid
mobilization [7–9]. Systemic [10] or adipose tissuespecific ablation [11] of CIDEC in mice substantially
enhanced lipolysis, diminished adipose tissue mass,
and triggered hepatic lipid deposition, dyslipidemia and
systemic insulin resistance. Therefore, CIDEC might
act as an underlying node tuning systemic metabolic
fluctuation, and could serve as a candidate gene for the
development of MS and its components.
Human data showed the amount of CIDEC mRNA
in white adipose tissue was decreased in obesity [12, 13],
and positively correlated with insulin sensitivity [12–14].

The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) is
globally rising and in China, it was 9.8% in men and 17.8%
in women in 2000–2001 [1]. MS and its components are
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease [2]
and oncogenesis [3], and cast a heavy economic burden on
public medical budgets [4]. Insulin resistance is considered
as the trigger of MS, and dysfunction of glucose and lipid
metabolism as the core manifestation [5]. The etiology of
MS is complicated involving the interaction of multiple
genes and environmental factors, the mechanism of which
remains elusive. Factors that interfere with glucose or
lipid homeostasis are proposed to potentially confer
an influence on the development, progression, and
intervention effects of MS, or its individual components.

In addition, a case with familial partial lipodystrophy 5
was reported to harbor a nonsense mutation at the sixth
exon of CIDEC [15]. To date, however, there has been a
lack of population-based association analysis on CIDEC
genetic variation with the risk of MS or its components,
or with the longitudinal changes of MS components in
follow-up study.
Diversity exists in drug response among population,
and genetic variation has been broadly conceived to be
largely responsible for the inter-individual variability [16].
Based on this, pharmacogenetics offers the opportunity for
precision medicine to improve drug efficacy and guide costeffective medical decision [17, 18]. The pathogenesis of MS
involves multiple proteins in interlaced molecular pathways,
which might serve as targets for the pharmacological
action of drugs correcting metabolic disturbance. As a
role of CIDEC was proposed in the development of MS,
it deserved exploration whether CIDEC genetic variation
might affect the efficacy of medication on MS or its
components. Moreover, economic expense should be taken
into account into drug efficacy evaluation to weigh the cost
and benefit of medication therapy [18].
Herein, we sought to explore the single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) of CIDEC at rs1053239 and
rs2479 in relation to the risk of MS and its components
in case-control and follow-up studies. Furthermore, the
impact of CIDEC genetic variation on the efficacy and
cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive agents was assessed
to facilitate medication choice in hypertension treatment.

GG genotype among Control group, and increased fasting
glucose in AG and AA than in GG genotype among MS
group, respectively.
Risk factors for MS and its components were then
estimated. Genotype distributions did not significantly
differ between subjects in Control and MS groups for
either SNP (Supplementary Table 4). Rs2479 variation,
however, was shown associated with a deteriorated
fasting glucose as presented in Table 2. Individuals of AG
(odds ratio 1.328 [95% confidence interval 1.066–1.655],
P = 0.012) and AA (1.473 [1.005–2.160], P = 0.047)
versus GG genotype were at a higher risk of elevated
fasting glucose. And carriers of A allele exhibited a
greater propensity for elevated fasting glucose (1.353
[1.098–1.666], P = 0.004). Nevertheless, neither SNP was
demonstrated to be in dependent association with other
MS components (Supplementary Table 4).

Association of SNPs with longitudinal changes of
MS components
To explore the association of SNP with the
longitudinal changes of MS components, individuals free
from antihypertensive, lipid-modulating, and hypoglycemic
treatment over 5-year follow-up were selected. The baseline
and follow-up characteristics of eligible participants were
summarized in Supplementary Table 5. Average changes
of MS components were stratified by rs1053239 or rs2479
genotype, respectively (Supplementary Table 6). The
increase of total cholesterol was higher in CC compared
with CG, and the increase of fasting glucose was lower
in CG compared with GG among rs1053239 genotypes.
Participants homozygous for rs2479 A allele showed a
more significant increment of total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) than carriers of G allele.
In multivariate linear regression analysis (Table 3), C
allele at rs1053239 was demonstrated to be an independent
contributor to the longitudinal aggravation of SBP
(β = 8.171, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP;
β = 3.708, P = 0.001). And A Allele at rs2479 showed
an adjusted association with the exacerbation of DBP
(β = 3.950, P = 0.003) and blood triglyceride (β = 0.296,
P < 0.001). Besides, the female gender was indicated to
be an independent determinant for an increase of waist
circumference and blood triglyceride, and a decrease of HDL.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the study population
Anthropometric and biological characteristics of
subjects in the initial of the investigation were summarized
in Table 1. Participants were sex- and age- matched in
Control and MS groups. The overall minor allele frequency
(MAF) was 0.409 (0.374 for Han Chinese in Beijing,
CHB; the Ensembl Database, http://www.ensembl.org/
index.html) for rs1053239 and 0.261 (0.252 for CHB; the
Ensembl Database) for rs2479. Genotype distribution in
Control, MS and total subjects were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).

Supplementary Table 7. Changes in blood pressure were
categorized among CIDEC rs1053239 or rs2479 genotypes
in Supplementary Table 8. Angiotensin II-targeted agents
lowered blood pressure in carriers of rs1053239 C allele, or
rs2479 A allele, while appeared ineffective in non-carriers.
These differences were further confirmed when adjusted
for other risk factors (rs1053239: β = −6.061, P < 0.001
for ΔSBP and β = −3.311, P = 0.001 for ΔDBP; rs2479: β
= −8.104, P < 0.001 for ΔSBP and β = −5.241, P < 0.001
for ΔDBP; Table 4). Blood pressure in hypertensives
with rs1053239 C allele was more lowered than in G
allele homozygotes upon CCB intervention in univariate
analysis (Supplementary Table 8). And C allele was shown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to contribute to a lower efficacy of CCB in decreasing SBP
after adjustment (β = 5.962, P = 0.003; Table 4). Diuretics
functioned more intensively in rs2479 A allele carriers than
non-carriers (Supplementary Table 8), which yet survived
covariates correction with nominal significance (Table 4).

Influence of SNPs on cost-effectiveness of
antihypertensive drugs
In order to weigh the balance of drug costs and
benefits, effects of SNPs on incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) of antihypertensive drugs were further
assessed. For rs1053239, ICER was markedly lower for

and high efficacy and cost-effectiveness for angiotensin
II-targeted antihypertensive drugs. Our study facilitated
the identification of individuals at higher risk for MS
components, and provided evidence for genotype-guided
application of angiotensin II-targeted therapy.
The two SNPs in the study are both located within
3′ untranslational regions (3′ UTRs) of the CIDEC gene. It
has been widely considered that 3′ UTRs supply platforms
for assembly of key elements in the 3′ end processing,
thus modulating mRNA stability and translatability, and
ultimately affecting protein expression [19]. Substitution
of the specific nucleotide at rs1053239 or rs2479, or
particular loci under tight linkage equilibrium with these
SNPs, may interfere with 3′ UTRs function and perturb the
normal expression of CIDEC.
The risk of elevated fasting glucose was increased
in carriers of A allele at rs2479 (Table 2), among whom
CIDEC expression might be impeded in the consequence

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated in a Chinese Han
cohort that the minor allele of SNP rs2479 (A allele) in
CIDEC was associated with the risk of elevated fasting
plasma glucose and blood triglyceride. Both the minor
allele of rs1053239 (C allele) and rs2479 in CIDEC
predicted a longitudinal deterioration of blood pressure,

of the variation. Negative correlation was observed
between fasting glucose and CIDEC expression in white
adipose tissue [13], and blood glucose was noticeably
raised due to CIDEC nonsense mutation [15], both in
line with our findings. Follow-up study proposed A
allele of rs2479 as an indicator of rapid exacerbation of
blood triglyceride (Table 3). Consistently, prominent
hypertriglyceridemia was elicited by loss of the C-terminal
portion of CIDEC [15]. CIDEC promotes adipogenesis
[6] and lipid droplets fusion [20–22], and suppresses
lipolysis by inhibiting the expression [7], localization [8],
and activity [9] of adipose triglyceride lipase. Therefore,
CIDEC is essential for the maintenance of appropriate
adipose mass and adequate lipid storage capacity.
Mutations at rs2479 which overlaps both of the two
dominate transcripts (Transcript ID: ENST00000423850,
ENST00000336832; the Ensembl Database) in adipose
tissue may repress CIDEC expression and impair lipid
storage capacity in adipose tissue. As a consequence,
excessive free fatty acids (FFAs) and unbalanced cluster
of adipokines would be released into circulation. Indeed,
CIDEC expression in white adipose tissue was reported to
be negatively correlated with blood FFAs concentration
[12]. Excessive FFAs [23] and dysregulated adipokines
network [24] disrupt glucose and lipid homeostasis by
triggering and accelerating systemic lipotoxicity and
insulin resistance, which may be possible mechanisms
of the elevation of blood glucose and triglyceride
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Intriguingly, we found that the respective minor
allele of rs1053239 and rs2479 independently contributed
to the aggravation of blood pressure (Table 3). To date,
little human data are available on the relation of CIDEC
with blood pressure, except for the development of
hypertension in a lipodystrophic patient with CIDEC
aberrant truncation [15]. Adipokines disturbance and

lipotoxicity disrupt blood pressure homeostasis by
accelerating insulin resistance and sequentially reducing
nitric oxide bioavailability [24]. Lipotoxicity per se
may also facilitate the development of hypertension
via activating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) [25] and amplifying vasoconstrictor response
to angiotensin II [26] (Supplementary Figure 1).
Furthermore, higher efficacy (Table 4) of angiotensin
II-targeted agents when applied to carriers of the minor
allele of rs1053239 or rs2479 highlighted the contribution
of RAAS activation upon CIDEC variation in the
pathophysiology of hypertension. This study therefore
suggested a role of CIDEC in blood pressure regulation
through modulating RAAS activity, and presented positive
evidence for preferential application of angiotensin IItargeted drugs for hypertensives carrying the minor allele
of rs1053239 or rs2479.
Some limitations in this study need to be considered.
First, the hypothetical molecular mechanism how 3′
UTR variation in CIDEC affected fasting glucose, blood
triglyceride and blood pressure (Supplementary Figure 1)
was not addressed in the present study. Second, further
validation for the predictive value of the two SNPs as risk
factor of MS components and pharmacogenetic indicator
of angiotensin II-targeted agents is required in independent
cohorts.
In conclusion, this study has indicated that
3′ UTR variation in CIDEC is associated with the
risk of elevated fasting glucose, the progression of
hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension, and the efficacy
of angiotensin II-targeted antihypertensive agents.
These results may shed light on the risk stratification
for elevated fasting glucose, hypertriglyceridemia and
hypertension, and possible approaches to genotypeguided individualized utilization of angiotensin IItargeted medication.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Height, weight and waist circumference were
measured and body mass index was calculated. Blood
pressure was measured on the right arm after a 5 minute-rest
in a seated position using an OMRON HEM-7011 electronic
sphygmomanometer (Omron, Dalian, China), and the
average of 3 consecutive readings in a single visit was used
in data analysis. Venous blood samples were obtained after
an over-night fasting for laboratory estimation and DNA
extraction. Plasma glucose and serum lipid concentrations
were determined with a Beckman Coulter LX20 chemistry
analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).

Ethics statement
This study was approved by the ethics committee of
Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects.

Study population
Participants in this study were of Chinese Han
nationality recruited from Shandong Province from January
to December of 2007. Questionnaires were conducted and
blood samples were obtained. MS was defined according
to the joint recommendations of the International Diabetes
Federation, American Heart Association, and National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [27]. The exclusive
criteria were: secondary hypertension, severe heart failure,
renal failure or valvular heart disease. Individuals with
missing covariates, missing biochemical data, undetected
or discordant genotype were also excluded. A total of 1064
unrelated subjects with MS and 1099 unrelated healthy
controls were enrolled. Among them, 1359 subjects
participated in the follow-up study, and 1184 remained
available at the end of 5-year follow-up in 2012. Details of
study design were illustrated in Figure 2.

SNP selection and genotyping
SNPs were selected based on the following criteria.
Firstly, SNPs located within CIDEC gene with a MAF of
> 5% in CHB according to the NCBI HapMap Database
(http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Secondly, selected
SNPs were entered into Haploview Ver. 4.2 software [28]
to obtain tag SNPs. Thirdly, intron variants among tag
SNPs were excluded. And lastly, so far no studies have
addressed the distribution regularities of the SNPs, or
their relationship with MS, in Chinese population. And
two SNPs rs1053239 and rs2479 were finally selected and
genotyped.
Genomic DNAs were extracted from blood by
Magen blood DNA kit D3133-03 (Magen, Guangzhou,
China) following the manufacturer’s protocols. SNPs at
rs1053239 and rs2479 were genotyped in BGI, Shenzhen,
China by Sequenom MassArray system (Sequenom, San
Diego, CA). The PCR reaction was conducted using
GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (ABI, Foster City, CA,
USA). And mass determination was performed with
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry [29]. Data were
collected by Spectro TYPER Ver. 4.0 software (Sequenom,
San Diego, CA). Call rates of genotyping were > 95% for

Demographic data collection, clinical and
biological assessment
Face-to-face questionnaire, physical examination
and blood sample collection were conducted using a
standard protocol by trained examiners at both baseline
and follow-up visit. Detailed information regarding
smoking and drinking habits, and medication use were
included in the questionnaire. Medication use included
the generic and brand name, dose, frequency and duration.

Costs estimates

GRANT SUPPORT

Official prices for drugs were obtained from
Shandong Provincial Bureau of Pricing. Drug costs were
inflated from the year of consumption to 2012 based on the
inflation rate of China provided by Trading Economics.
Drug costs were in US dollars (USD) according to the
average exchange rate of 2012 published by the Bank of
China (1USD = 6.313RMB).

This work was supported by the research grants
from the National Natural Science Foundation of China
(81471036, 81470560, 81570400, 81570356, 81100605,
81270352, 81270287, 81300168 and 91439201), the
Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province
(ZR2014HQ037), the Specialized Research Fund for
the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP
20130131120065), the Key research and development
program of Shandong Province (2015GSF118062), and
the National Basic Research Program of China (973
Program, Grant No. 2013CB530703).

Statistical analysis
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for rs1053239 and
rs2479 was tested using χ2 goodness-of-fit test. Continuous
variables were presented as mean and SD or SEM, and
compared by Student’s t test, paired t test or analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc least-significant
differences t test. Categorical variables were presented
as percentages, and compared by χ2 test with Bonferroni
correction when appropriate. Multivariate logistic
regression was performed to evaluate the risk factors of
MS and its components. Longitudinal change (referred
to as Δ) of MS components was calculated as the value
at the end of 5-year follow-up minus that at baseline.
Multiple stepwise linear regression was used to assess
the contribution of SNPs to the longitudinal changes of
MS components and the efficacy of antihypertensive
drugs. Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS Ver.
17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). P values were two-tailed and
considered significant when less than 0.05.
ICER of antihypertensive drugs for each genotype
was calculated as follows: ICER = C / (BP1 - BP0), where
BP0 as the blood pressure of subjects with the genotype
untreated by antihypertensive drugs, and C and BP1 as
the costs of antihypertensive drugs and blood pressure
of subjects with the genotype treated by one particular
antihypertensive monotherapy.
Power and Sample Size Calculation Ver. 3.1.2
software was used for power calculation [30]. The
sample size of 2163 participants in the case-control study
provided > 95% power to detect a 5% difference in fasting
glucose between groups, with the MAF of 0.252 (CHB,
the Ensembl Database). The minimum sample size of 109
participants in pharmacogenetic analysis provided > 95%
power to detect a 5% difference in blood pressure between
genotypes, assuming an SD of 35%~65% of average
changes in blood pressure.
