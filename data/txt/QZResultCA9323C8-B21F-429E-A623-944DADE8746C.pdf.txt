BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the effects of new adjuvant treatment regimens on menstrual
functioning in premenopausal women with early breast cancer. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective
review of data from premenopausal women who received treatment for early breast cancer to evaluate the rates of
amenorrhea in follow-up. The women who were included received treatment with either doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or combined AC and paclitaxel (T) (AC-T) given either every 3 weeks, or as a dose-dense (DD) regimen, or as AC followed by weekly T with trastuzumab or followed by trastuzumab (AC-Tþtrastuzumab). A
multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate amenorrhea during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 431
patients who were eligible for analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 13 years (range, 25-55 years), 61% of women
received AC only, and 39% received AC-T. Of the 39% who received AC-T, 49% of women received DD therapy, 14%
received AC-T þ trastuzumab, and 71% of all patients received tamoxifen (TAM). The median follow-up was 33 months
(range, 6-114 months). After adjusting for age, weight, gravidity, parity, age at menarche, smoking, alcohol use, TAM
use, type and regimen of chemotherapy, and use of trastuzumab, the likelihood of remaining amenorrheic was not
statistically different in patients who received AC-T versus AC (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.8-3.2), DD treatment versus treatment every 3 weeks (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.25-1.3), or AC-T þ trastuzumab (OR, 0.6;
95% CI, 0.22-1.61). Amenorrhea was associated significantly with TAM use and age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:

Of the estimated 178,480 new diagnoses of breast cancer in 2007, approximately 25% occurred in premenopausal

women.1,2 Earlier diagnosis and treatment advances, including the widespread use of chemotherapy in premenopausal
women, have been successful in increasing the 5-year survival rate among young patients with breast cancer.3 Consequently, breast cancer survivors are living longer with the side effects of their treatment. For many young women who are
surviving cancer, few issues are more relevant than that of the impact of treatment on their reproductive function.
Adjuvant chemotherapy may render a premenopausal woman amenorrheic, either temporarily or permanently.4-7 In
women with a history of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, premature menopause has been associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence; however, it is not clear that this adds to the benefits of the current standard adjuvant tamoxifen
(TAM) therapy. Premature menopause clearly can have profoundly deleterious effects on quality of life. Physical ramifications of menopause are multifold and include cardiovascular system changes, osteoporosis, altered sexual function, and hot
flushes. Early menopause also truncates the reproductive potential of survivors, and facing a diagnosis of infertility after
breast cancer can be challenging. Without question, the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function can have an adverse
effect on a woman’s emotional well being8 and quality of life on a long-term basis. For some women who are facing a

diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, fertility concerns
may be so powerful that they have an impact on treatment
decisions.9 Furthermore, understanding a woman’s risk of
becoming postmenopausal after chemotherapy has important implications for future treatment (eg, consideration of
adjuvant aromatase-inhibitor therapy) and family planning
(eg, the need for contraception).
The link between adjuvant chemotherapy and amenorrhea has been well established, but the specific effects of
individual chemotherapeutic agents and regimens have not
been well characterized. In particular, data pertaining to the
use of taxanes are sparse and controversial. Similarly, almost
no information exists on the use of a dose-dense (DD)
schedule (treatment every 2 weeks) on chemotherapyrelated amenorrhea (CRA). In addition, the impact of trastuzumab on CRA is not well documented. The primary
objectives of the current study were to evaluate the relation
between CRA at a follow-up 6 months and the addition
of paclitaxel (T) to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
(AC) and to explore the effects of the use of a DD regimen
and the use of trastuzumab, with or without TAM, in premenopausal women with breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We identified patients by using an institutional database for
which data are input prospectively for all women who
undergo breast cancer treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. Informed
consent was obtained from patients before entry of their
medical information and personal characteristics into the
database. The Institutional Review Board of Dana Farber/
Harvard Cancer Center approved this study. Eligible
women had been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer
and received adjuvant chemotherapy from 1997 through
2005. Women were selected for this analysis from the institutional database if they received adjuvant AC chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600
mg/m2) either every 3 weeks or as DD therapy, with or
without the addition of T or T þ trastuzumab, and if they
were premenopausal at diagnosis. Women were classified as
premenopausal in the database if they had menses in the
past 6 months and were classified as postmenopausal if they
had no menses in the past 6 months because of natural menopause; removal of both ovaries; chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or endocrine therapy for a prior nonbreast cancer;
ovarian failure from a medical condition; or had a menstrual
period in the past 6 months during hormone-replacement

792

therapy. This information was obtained from the baseline
patient survey with back-up chart review before it was input
into the database. Patients with contradictory or missing
data were classified as postmenopausal if they were aged
50 years. For this study, a detailed chart review was used
to confirm eligibility regarding premenopausal status at diagnosis and the receipt of 1 of the chemotherapy regimens
of interest. The chemotherapy regimens allowed included: 4
cycles of AC only, AC followed by 4 cycles of T (paclitaxel
175 mg/m2) (AC-T), or AC followed or preceded by 1)
weekly T (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 with weekly trastuzumab [2
mg/kg, with an initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg] for 12
weeks, followed for some patients by 40 additional weeks of
trastuzumab after the completion of conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy), or 2) weekly T alone  12 followed by
weekly trastuzumab for 52 weeks (grouped as AC-T þ trastuzumab). Information regarding the receipt of TAM
(20 mg daily) also was obtained from chart review. For the
primary objectives of this study, all women were required to
have menstrual function information in the medical record
for a minimum of 6 months after treatment cessation.
Patients were excluded if they had undergone surgical or
medical ovarian ablation early in follow-up, if they had
received prior treatment with chemotherapy, if there was no
follow-up, or if their menstrual status could not be ascertained in follow-up from the medical record. Patients who
developed recurrences that required additional chemotherapy were included in the analysis up until the time of their
new treatment.
For this analysis, we defined ‘‘amenorrhea’’ as the
continued absence of menstrual periods as recorded in the
medical record at time intervals of 6 months, 6 to 12
months, and >12 months from the date of the patient’s
last dose of chemotherapy with AC or T with or without
trastuzumab. If a patient reported the presence of cyclic
bleeding at any point in an interval, then she was not considered amenorrheic for that interval. Patients without
evidence of cyclic bleeding within the interval of interest
were considered amenorrheic. For this analysis, a single,
isolated episode of bleeding was not counted as a resumption of menstrual function and, instead, was assumed to
be similar to an episode of ‘‘postmenopausal bleeding.’’
Statistical Methods
The distribution of patient characteristics was quantified
among all women and stratified by amenorrheic status
throughout follow-up. Two models were fit to the data to
identify relations between chemotherapy regimen and the
likelihood of remaining amenorrheic. Unconditional

multivariate logistic regression—adjusted for age at diagnosis, age at menarche, weight, gravidity, parity, smoking,
alcohol consumption, type and regimen of chemotherapy,
TAM use, trastuzumab use and length of follow-up—was
used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), which are presented as estimates of the relative risk. To evaluate heterogeneous associations among
women who were older versus those who were younger at
diagnosis, we also applied these models to the study population stratified at age 40 years.
All multivariate Wald statistic P values are based on 2sided tests. The SAS statistical software package (version
9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all analyses.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
We identified 431 premenopausal breast cancer patients
who met eligibility criteria. (Table 1) Eight hundred
ninety-two premenopausal breast cancer patients were
identified originally from the institutional database who
received AC chemotherapy either every 3 weeks or on a
DD schedule, with or without the addition of T or T þ
trastuzumab, However, after a detailed chart review, 461
patients were excluded based on the following reasons:
Three hundred forty-six patients received chemotherapy
with drugs or regimens different from the study criteria,
64 patients had undergone hysterectomy and/or removal
of bilateral ovaries before diagnosis, 10 patients underwent hysterectomy after completing chemotherapy but
before 6 months of follow-up, 26 patients had insufficient
information about menstrual status after follow-up, 14
patients received luprolide or aromatase inhibitors during
and/or after chemotherapy, and 1 patient had undergone
uterine artery embolization before diagnosis. The median
follow-up was 33 months (range, 6-114 months). Data
were available for 100% of patients at the 6-month interval after the completion of chemotherapy, for 97% of
patients at the 6-month to 12-month interval, and for
96% of patients at the >12-month interval. One hundred
ninety-two women (45%) remained premenopausal after
completion of chemotherapy, and 239 women (55%)
reported no menses during follow-up. Among the women
who reported menses, 119 of 192 (62%) reported menstruating within 6 months of treatment cessation, 60 of
192 (31%) reported menstruating within 12 months, and
an additional 13 of 192 (7%) reported menstruating >12
months after cessation. (Table 2) Hence, if menses were
to be present after the completion of treatment, the major-

ity of women reported menstruating within the first 6month interval, whereas the proportion that experienced
the return of menses >12 months after treatment cessation was small.
After adjusting for age, weight, gravidity, parity, age
at menarche, smoking, alcohol use, TAM use, type and
regimen of chemotherapy, use of trastuzumab, and length
of follow-up, the multivariate model revealed that the
likelihood of remaining amenorrheic during follow-up
was associated significantly with TAM use and age at diagnosis (Table 3). Patients who were receiving TAM therapy
were twice as likely to remain amenorrheic compared with

793

Original Article

those who were not receiving TAM (OR, 2.12; 95% CI,
1.13-4.00). Similarly, increasing age at diagnosis was associated positively with an increased risk of developing CRA
(test for trend; P < .0001). For example, patients who
were ages 35 years to 39 years at diagnosis were 10 times
as likely to remain amenorrheic compared with patients
who were aged <35 years at diagnosis (OR, 10.1; 95%
CI, 1.28-79.0). The likelihood of remaining amenorrheic
did not differ statistically for patients who received AC-T

versus AC (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.80-3.22), patients who
received DD treatment versus treatment every 3 weeks
(OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.25-1.3), or patients who received
trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (OR, 0.6; 95%
CI, 0.22-1.61). These relations were similar to those
observed in unadjusted analyses, as noted in Table 3, and,
thus, were robust to confounding by factors that were
included in the multivariate models.
When stratifying by age at diagnosis and evaluating
the relation between specific treatment regimens and the
likelihood of remaining amenorrheic, we observed that,
among patients who were aged 40 years at diagnosis (N
¼ 296), TAM use was associated with a 2-fold increased
likelihood of remaining amenorrheic (OR, 2.51; 95% CI,
1.20-5.24) (Table 4). However, among women who were
aged <40 years at diagnosis (N ¼ 138), the significant
association with TAM was not observed (OR, 1.89; 95%
CI, 0.52-6.89). No statistically significant difference in
the likelihood of CRA was observed among patients who
were ages <40 years or >40 years at diagnosis who
received treatment with or without T or trastuzumab or

An assessment of women with treatment-related
amenorrhea by age and chemotherapy revealed that,
regardless of the specific regimen used, women aged <40
years had a much lower incidence of amenorrhea after
treatment than women between ages 40 years and 49 years
(Table 5). From 94% to 100% of women who were aged
>50 years at the onset of treatment became amenorrheic
after treatment, whereas only 0% to 16% of women aged
<40 years were amenorrheic after treatment. The small

DISCUSSION
In this evaluation of follow-up menstrual functioning in
premenopausal women with invasive breast cancer who
received adjuvant chemotherapy with AC with or without
the addition of T, trastuzumab, or TAM, given either every 3 weeks or as a DD regimen, we observed no statistically significant increased likelihood of CRA in patients
who received T or trastuzumab compared with those who
received AC alone. Similarly, there was no statistically significant increase in the likelihood of CRA in patients who
were treated on DD regimens compared with those who
were treated on standard regimens (every 3 weeks).
Although there may be a trend toward an effect,

795

Original Article

anyundetected, small increase in the risk of CRA is
unlikely to have substantial clinical implications. Our
findings suggest that 2 factors significantly increased the
likelihood of CRA: age at diagnosis and TAM use. This
significant association of TAM and age on the risk of
CRA is consistent with previous studies that quantified
the risk of CRA with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.10,11 Our findings support those reported in previous studies: For women aged <30 years, premature
ovarian failure with standard regimens is very uncommon.
The observed risk of CRA with 4 cycles of standard AC
was <1% among women aged <30 years.5,12,13 With 4
cycles of AC, the risk of premature ovarian failure increases
up to the 10% to 15% range among all women aged <40
years.13-15 The risk in younger women after 6 cycles of
combined cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or combined cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-fluorouracil is somewhat higher; with these
regimens, up to 20% of women aged 30 years and up to
40% of women aged 40 years will experience premature
menopause.11,13-15 Age at the onset of adjuvant chemotherapy was a significant linear predictor of CRA. Compared
with women who were aged <25 years at diagnosis, women
who were between ages 35 years and 39 years at diagnosis
were 10 times more likely to remain amenorrheic. Women
who were between ages 40 years and 44 years at diagnosis
were nearly 40 times more likely to remain amenorrheic,
and women who were aged >45 years at diagnosis were
>500 times more likely to remain amenorrheic.
It has been reported that TAM improves disease-free
survival in premenopausal women who have positive
estrogen receptor status.16 The relation of TAM and CRA
is unclear in the literature. Some studies report no increase
the risk of CRA for patients who take TAM,17-19 whereas
others report a higher incidence of CRA among patients
who use TAM.4,16,20,21 These inconsistencies may reflect
differences in the ages of women in the studies as well as
the length of follow-up. Our study suggests that the effect
of TAM on CRA varies by age, because women aged 40
years were more likely to have CRA when they were taking
TAM, whereas TAM appeared to have less of an association with CRA in younger women. Although TAM
clearly is related to menstrual irregularities in some
women while they are on the medication, there is no evidence nor is it biologically probable that TAM directly
damages the ovaries. However, women would be expected
to be less fertile after TAM or other hormone treatment
because of the natural decline of ovarian function over the
time it takes to receive standard therapy.

796

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date
that is focused on the effect of adding T to AC chemotherapy on subsequent menstrual function. Although some
previous studies reported an increased risk of amenorrhea
with the addition of taxanes, including T19,22-26 or docetaxel (D),22,25,26 others reported a decreased or equivalent
risk with T and/or D or with T alone.23,27,28 In a retrospective analysis in which 60 patients received AC alone
and 21 patients received AC þ T on a standard dosing
regimen, CRA was less likely in the group that received
T.27 In a prospective study of 64 women, 32 women
received AC alone, whereas 14 women received AC followed by T on a standard dosing regimen, Alton et al
observed that women who received AC followed by T
were 33% as likely to experience CRA as women who
received AC only.29 In another retrospective study, Fornier et al demonstrated no change in the effect on menstrual functioning with the addition of taxanes, T, and/or
D.18 Wide variation in the specific agents (including AC,
CMF, T, or D) and doses used, as well as the definition of
amenorrhea, may account in part for these differences.
Findings from the current study in which the risk of CRA
was evaluated in patients who received AC with or without the addition of T on standard versus DD regimens
did not demonstrate a statistically significant increased
risk of CRA in patients who received T on either standard
or DD regimens. This study adds to the evidence that the
addition of T does not appreciably increase the risk of
CRA. Although the administration of AC and T in a DD
regimen reportedly is not accompanied by substantially
increased conventional chemotherapy toxicity,30 little
previous information is available to assess the risk of CRA.
In 1 previous analysis, patients received equal doses of epirubicin given every 14 days or 21 days, and the incidence
of amenorrhea was equal in both arms.31 In the study by
Fornier et al, 34 of 166 patients who were evaluated had
received AC followed by T on a DD regimen, and no
apparent increase in the risk of amenorrhea was observed
in these patients.18 Our findings confirm these results.
To our knowledge, the risk of CRA related to treatment with trastuzumab, has not been assessed previously.
Almost 25% of breast cancer patients have tumors that
over express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2).32 Today, trastuzumab is used widely for the
treatment of these tumors based on results from several
large, randomized trials.20,33 In the current study, we
observed no increase in the likelihood of CRA for patients
receiving trastuzumab on short-term (12 weeks) or longterm (52 weeks) regimens. Although we were limited by

the small sample size and diversity of regimens used, our
preliminary findings may be useful for patients who are
receiving trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer,
and attempts to replicate this observation should be
undertaken in larger studies.
Limitations of the current study include its retrospective design and the small numbers for certain subgroups (eg, trastuzumab). Information on baseline
menstrual functioning was obtained through the retrospective review of prospectively collected data and was
confirmed by a detailed chart review. Women under
the stress of cancer treatment may be less focused on
their menstruation status at diagnosis and in follow-up.
Similarly, women who are postchemotherapy and concerned about fertility may be more apt to remember
even the subtlest details of their cycles. Furthermore,
missing information or potentially inaccurate follow-up
menstrual information recorded by providers in the
medical record may introduce bias. The large sample
size of the current study, compared with the relatively
small number of women who were excluded from this
analysis for missing menstrual data in the follow-up
data, is reassuring. In ongoing work, prospectively collected data obtained by patient interview or questionnaires specifically geared toward menstrual functioning
and not dependent on patient or physician recall will
limit these biases.
Our findings may assist in the counseling of premenopausal women with breast cancer. Treatments that
may be viewed as more aggressive, such as the addition
of taxanes and trastuzumab and the use of DD regimens, do not necessarily lead to an increased risk of
CRA, a dreaded consequence of chemotherapy for some
premenopausal women. Data from our study demonstrate that a significant proportion of premenopausal
women who are diagnosed with breast cancer will continue to menstruate for at least some time after chemotherapy. Clearly, however, menstruation is an imperfect
surrogate for fertility, and ovarian reserve markers may
reflect more accurately the damaging effects of cytotoxic
therapy on ovarian function. Recent research has
revealed that even women who continue to menstruate
after chemotherapy may have diminished markers of
ovarian reserve in follow-up.34,35 Further research in
this population is warranted to determine ovarian
reserve and, ultimately, fertility outcomes and to determine the timing of menopause in survivors who remain
premenopausal after modern breast cancer chemotherapy regimens.
