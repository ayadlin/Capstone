Abstract
Forkhead box F1 (Foxf1) transcription factor is an important regulator of
embryonic development but its role in tumor cells remains incompletely understood.
While 16 proteins were characterized in fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, its
interactions with cellular transcriptional machinery remain poorly characterized.
Here, we identified FoxF1 protein as a novel interacting partner of the FA complex
proteins. Using multiple human and mouse tumor cell lines and Foxf1+/− mice we
demonstrated that FoxF1 physically binds to and increases stability of FA proteins.
FoxF1 co-localizes with FANCD2 in DNA repair foci in cultured cells and tumor tissues
obtained from cisplatin-treated mice. In response to DNA damage, FoxF1-deficient
tumor cells showed significantly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCM
phosphorylation, resulting in impaired formation of DNA repair foci. FoxF1 knockdown
caused chromosomal instability, nuclear abnormalities, and increased tumor cell death
in response to DNA-damaging agents. Overexpression of FoxF1 in DNA-damaged cells
improved stability of FA proteins, decreased chromosomal and nuclear aberrations,
restored formation of DNA repair foci and prevented cell death after DNA damage.
These findings demonstrate that FoxF1 is a key component of FA complexes and a
critical mediator of DNA damage response in tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

gastrointestinal abnormalities, limb deformities and skin
hyperpigmentation [6–8]. The higher cancer susceptibility
of FA patients is due to defects in the DNA damage repair
pathway. The hallmark cellular feature of cells derived
from FA patients includes chromosomal instability and
hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin
C (MMC), Cisplatin and diepoxybutane (DEB) [9–10].
This rare cancer-prone disease has generated wide-spread
attention because the proteins involved in FA have led to
the elucidation of a repair pathway for interstrand DNA
crosslinks (ICL).
To date, sixteen FA tumor suppressor genes that
act together to protect cells against the stress generated
by ICL agents or endogenous metabolites have been
identified [8, 11, 12]. The proteins encoded by these genes
form multiple complexes to orchestrate ICL repair. The
Fanconi anemia defect results from bi-allelic mutation
of any one of sixteen known FA genes. The FA core
complex, comprised of 8 proteins (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F,

Cancer cells possess diverse phenotypic features
which distinguish them from their nonmalignant
counterparts. The most prominent features of cancer cells
are enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptotic
rates along with an inherent capability to invade
and metastasize [1–2]. Malignant cells also possess
chromosomal instability which is a crucial feature needed
for the tumor progression [3]. In order to attain a state
of chromosomal instability, cancer cells inhibit DNA
damage response by accumulating inactivating mutations
in genes critical for DNA repair pathways, including
genes encoding subunits of Fanconi anemia complex
[4]. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare pediatric chromosome
instability disorder characterized by developmental
defects, bone marrow failure and higher susceptibility
to both hematologic and nonhematologic cancers
[4–8]. Other symptoms of FA include endocrine and

FOXF1 promoter has been reported for breast invasive
ductal carcinomas [35]. In contrast, FoxF1 expression
was increased in patched-associated tumors, such as basal
cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma
[36–38], underlying the importance of FoxF1 in aberrant
Hedgehog signaling in human cancers. Overexpression
of FoxF1 promoted invasion and metastasis of breast
carcinomas [39] and enhanced the tumor-promoting
properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts [40].
In the current study, we demonstrated that FoxF1 is
a novel interacting partner for the FA protein complexes.
FoxF1 physically binds to the FA core and I/D2 complexes,
induces their binding to chromatin, promotes DNA repair
and protects tumor cells from cell death in response to
DNA-damaging agents. Our findings indicate that FoxF1
protein is a key regulatory component of the FA pathway
and a critical mediator of DNA damage response.

-G, -L and -M), along with 6 associated factors (FAAP20,
FAAP100, FAAP24, HES1, MHF1 and MHF2), acts
as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate the FANCI/FANCD2 (I/
D2) complex, resulting in activation of a downstream
DNA repair response [7, 10, 12–14]. In addition to the
FA core and I/D2 complex, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/
PALB2, FANCJ/BACH1, FANCO/RAD51C, FANCP/
SLX4 and the associated proteins RAD51, RAD18 and
FAN1 participate in FA DNA repair response. All these
proteins function together to facilitate DNA interstrand
cross-link and other DNA damage response repairs by
recovering and stabilizing stalled replication forks. The
deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme USP1 (ubiquitin-specific
peptidase 1) along with UAF1 (USP1-associated factor 1),
deubiquitinates the FANCD2-I complex to complete the
repair process [12, 13].
Recent studies demonstrated that FA proteins
participate in cellular processes well beyond DNA repair
[12, 15]. FANCD2 protein has been shown to promote
nucleosome assembly, and it also interacts directly
with the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Tip60 [16,
17]. FANCD2 protein has also been reported to act as a
transcriptional activator of tumor suppressor gene Tap63
[18]. FA proteins have also been implicated in mitosis
and cytokinesis. FANCI and FANCD2 proteins have been
shown to localize to ultrafine DNA bridges linking sister
chromatids during cell division [19]. FA proteins interact
with Hes1, Runx1 and Runx3 transcription factors that
regulate stability of FA complexes [20–21]. Despite the
identification and characterization of multiple proteins in
the FA protein complexes, their interactions with cellular
transcriptional machinery remain poorly characterized.
Forkhead Box F1 (FoxF1) transcription factor
is a critical mediator of lung development and lung
injury/ repair [22–27]. Heterozygous deletions and point
mutations in the FOXF1 gene locus were found in patients
with Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of
Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV), a rare congenital disorder
characterized by severe defects in development of the
alveolar capillary network. Global deletion of Foxf1
in mice (Foxf1−/−) is embryonic lethal [28], and FoxF1
heterozygous mice (Foxf1+/−) exhibit alveolar capillary
dysplasia and abnormal lung repair [23, 29, 24]. During
lung development, the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway
stimulates expression of FoxF1 [29], which in turn,
transcriptionally activates expression of VEGF receptors
and promotes VEGF signaling in embryonic endothelial
cells [22]. FoxF1 binds to serum response factor (SRF)
and myocardin to regulate SRF signaling in smooth
muscle cells [30, 31]. Recent studies reported deregulation
of FOXF1 gene in human cancers [32]. FoxF1 was
identified as a target gene of tumor suppressor p53,
forming a transcriptional network which regulates cancer
cell migration and invasiveness [33]. Genomic deletions
in FOXF1 gene locus have been found in prostate cancer
samples [33–34], whereas epigenetic inactivation of

FoxF1 transcription factor physically interacts
with FA proteins complexes
Since protein-protein interactions between FA
complexes and cellular transcriptional machinery are
not well understood, we used 2-step affinity purification
coupled with immunoblotting to screen for transcription
factors physically bound to FANCM protein, an FA core
complex component [41, 42]. HT1080 tumor cells stably
expressing His-Flag tagged FANCM (HF-FANCM)
protein [41] were used for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP).
Among multiple transcription factors screened in this
assay, endogenous FoxF1 protein was found to bind the
HF-FANCM along with its known interacting partners,
such as FANCA, FANCI, FAAP100, FAAP20, MHF1
and MHF2 (Figure 1A). To demonstrate specificity of
FoxF1 /FA protein interactions, we also tested for the
presence of other forkhead box transcription factors
in FA core complex, such as FoxA2, FoxA3, FoxE1,
FoxJ1 and FoxM1. While HT1080 cells expressed only
FoxA2, FoxM1 and FoxJ1, none of them was found
to be interacting with FANCM (Figure 1A). In order
to confirm the interaction of FoxF1 with FA complex
proteins, reciprocal co-IP experiments were performed.
Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, we generated two
distinct cell lines stably expressing FoxF1 protein, which
contains an N-terminal Flag and a C-terminal (His)6tag (HF-FoxF1). HF-FoxF1 and its interacting proteins
were purified from nuclear extracts by a 2-step affinity
purification approach. Immunoblot analysis of proteins
in the FoxF1 purified fraction showed interaction with
multiple FA core complex proteins, including FANCM,
FAAP100, FANCA, FANCL, FAAP24 and FAAP20
(Figure 1B). FoxF1 also bound to FANCI and FANCD2
proteins that are main components of downstream I/D2 FA
complex (Figure 1B). Other Fox proteins, such as FoxM1,

FoxJ1 and FoxA2 did not interact with FA complexes
(Figure 1B), confirming a specificity of FoxF1/FA protein
interactions. Interactions between the FoxF1 and FA
complex proteins were not due to DNA contamination of

the protein lysate, because neither ethidium bromide nor
DNase, which precipitate and degrade DNA, respectively,
prevented FoxF1/FA protein interactions (Figure 1C). To
determine whether endogenous FoxF1 co-fractionates with

FA complex proteins, we performed a superpose-6 gel
filtration experiment of nuclear extract from HeLa cells.
The gel filtration profile of endogenous FoxF1 protein
overlapped with that of several FA core proteins, such as
FANCA, FANCM, FAAP100, FAAP20 and MHF1 (Figure
1E), confirming that FoxF1 interacts with the FA proteins.
Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that FoxF1
specifically binds to the FA core and I/D2 FA complexes
through protein-protein interactions.

Western blot of tumor lysate (Figure 3A; lanes 1 and 2).
Increased FoxF1 levels in cisplatin-treated tumors were
associated with an increase in FA complex proteins,
including FANCM, FANCI, FAAP20, FAAP100 and
MHF1 (Figure 3A). Interestingly, stable overexpression
of FoxF1 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells was sufficient to
increase FA protein levels in tumor tissue even in the
absence of DNA damage (Figure 3A, lanes 3–5). Thus,
FoxF1 increases the FA protein levels in tumor tissue in a
mouse model of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Since depletion of FoxF1 reduced the association of
the FA core and I/D2 complexes with chromatin (Figure
2B), we examined whether FoxF1 is physically present in
DNA repair foci. FANCD2, a marker of DNA repair foci
[16, 43, 44] co-localized with FoxF1 in nuclei of tumor
cells treated with hydroxyurea, which induces a DNAdamage response (Figure 3G). Co-localization of FoxF1
with FANCD2 was also observed in a subset of tumor cells
located within cisplatin-treated rhabdomyosarcoma tumors
(Figure 3F). Thus, FoxF1 is physically present in DNA
repair foci induced by DNA damaging agents.
Next, we determined whether FoxF1/FA proteinprotein interactions are altered in response to DNA
damage. HeLa tumor cells stably expressing HF-FoxF1
were treated with Camptothecin to induce DNA damage
response and the binding of FoxF1 with FA proteins was
examined by IP. Interaction of HF-FoxF1 with the FA
complexes was increased after DNA damage as shown by
increased binding of FoxF1 to FANCM, FANCI, FANCL,
FAAP20 and MHF1 proteins (Figure 4A). Thus, DNA
damage increases association of FoxF1 with FA complex
proteins.

FoxF1 increases binding of FA complex to
chromatin
The absence of one interacting protein has been
shown to decrease the stability of the entire FA and I/D2
complexes [7, 41]. Consistent with these studies, siRNAmediated knockdown of FoxF1 in four different cell
lines reduced steady-state levels of FANCM, FANCD2,
FANCI, FAAP100, FAAP24, FAAP20 and MHF1 proteins
as shown by Western blot (Figure 2A). To rule out the
possibility that FoxF1 transcriptionally regulates the
expression of FA genes, qRT-PCR was used to examine
FA mRNAs in FoxF1-depleted cells. Depletion of FoxF1
did not influence mRNA levels of FA genes (Figure 1D).
Analysis of chromatin-associated proteins further revealed
that depletion of FoxF1 reduced FA protein levels in the
chromatin-bound nuclear fraction (Figure 2B), suggesting
that FoxF1 promotes association of the FA core and I/D2
complexes with the chromatin. Treatment with proteasome
inhibitor MG132 resulted in recovery of MHF1 and
FAAP20 protein levels even in FoxF1-depleted cells
(Figure 2C), indicating that FoxF1 regulates degradation
of the FA proteins.
Since Foxf1−/− mouse embryos die very early in
development, we used heterozygous Foxf1+/− embryos
to examine FA protein levels. Reduced levels of the FA
complex proteins FANCM, FAAP100, FAAP20 and
MHF1 were found in lung tissue obtained from E15.5
and E17.5 Foxf1+/− embryos that contained diminished
FoxF1 protein levels as shown by Western blot (Figure
2D–2E and 2G–2H). Similar data were obtained from
lung tissue of Foxf1+/− newborn mice (Figure 2F and 2I).
Thus, inactivation of FoxF1 in vitro and in vivo reduces
FA protein levels.

FoxF1 increases activation of the FA complex in
response to DNA damage
Next, we examined downstream events in the FA
DNA repair pathway in the presence or absence of FoxF1.
Specifically, siRNA-mediated depletion of FoxF1 was
used to determine whether FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination
and FANCM phosphorylation, critical steps in activation
of the FA DNA repair complex [16, 41, 43, 45], are
regulated by FoxF1. In response to DNA damage mediated
by HU and MMC, both FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and
FANCM phosphorylation were detected in tumor cells
transfected with control siRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 4, 7).
FoxF1 knockdown decreased protein levels of FANCM,
FANCD2, FAAP24, FAAP20 and MHF1 (Figure 4B).
In addition, FANCM phosphorylation did not occur
and FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination was significantly
reduced in tumor cells transfected with FoxF1-specific
siRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 5, 8). Thus, depletion of FoxF1
decreased FA protein stability and prevented activation
of the FA complex in response to DNA damage. To
determine whether this effect is a direct consequence
of FoxF1 knockdown, but not an off-target effect of

DNA damage increases association of FoxF1 with
FA proteins
Previous studies have shown that stability of FA
complex proteins is increased after DNA damage [7, 10,
41]. Therefore we used cisplatin, a known DNA-damaging
agent, to examine FA protein levels in FoxF1-expressing
tumor cells in vivo. Mice bearing FoxF1-overexpressing
or control rhabdomyosarcoma tumors were treated with
cisplatin to induce DNA damage response. Cisplatin
treatment increased FoxF1 protein levels as shown by

HF-FoxF1 overexpression improved stability of FA core

activation of FA complex after DNA damage.

which directly binds to FA protein complexes, mediating
its activation, translocation to DNA repair foci and binding
to chromatin.

Discussion
Previous studies with FoxF1-deficient mice have
shown that FoxF1 is an important transcriptional regulator
of embryonic development [49–51], however, its role in
DNA repair of tumor cells remains uncharacterized. In
the present study, we demonstrated that FoxF1 induces
DNA repair and directly interact with the FA core and
I/D2 complexes. In contrast, other Fox proteins (FoxM1,
FoxJ1 and FoxA2) do not bind to FA complexes. The
interaction of endogenous FoxF1 with the FA proteins
was shown by co-IP experiments, as well as a reciprocal
IP’s using ectopically expressed FoxF1 protein. Together
with a similar superpose-6 gel filtration profile, our
results strongly suggest that FoxF1 associates with the
FA complex via protein-protein interactions. Interestingly,
ethidium bromide but not DNase reduced the association
of FoxF1 with FANCM, FANCA and FANCL, suggesting
that DNase-resistant DNA can contribute to FoxF1/FA
protein interactions.
The expression levels of individual proteins in
multi-protein complexes are often coordinated in order
to achieve proper assembly and function of that complex.
Previous studies of FA complexes suggest interdependence
of FA proteins on expression and stability of individual
protein subunits [10, 41, 46, 48]. For example, the absence
of FANCA made FANCG and FANCL proteins unstable
[42]. Stability of FAAP100 protein was decreased in the
absence of either FANCB or FANCL [52]. Knockdown
of MHF1 resulted in decreased stability of FANCM and
MHF2 proteins [41], whereas FANCA and FAAP20 are
dependent on each other for their protein stability [7]. In
the present study, we observed that depletion of FoxF1
from various cell lines, including MFLM-91U, HeLa,
HT1080 and LLC tumor cells, reduced steady-state levels
of FA proteins but did not affect their mRNA levels.
These results suggest that FoxF1 increases stability of the
FA protein complexes. Consistent with this hypothesis,
proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased FA protein levels
in FoxF1-depleted tumor cells. Therefore, it is possible
that FoxF1 prevents proteasome-mediated degradation of
the FA proteins.
Interestingly, diminished FA protein levels were
found in lung tissue of Foxf1+/− mice and embryos.
Foxf1+/− mice exhibit alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD),
which results from abnormal development of pulmonary
capillaries [23]. While the role of FA genes in lung
development is unknown, patients with FA mutations do
not develop ACD. Therefore, it is unlikely that reduced
FA protein levels contribute to developmental defects in
Foxf1+/− lungs.
Published studies demonstrated that MHF1,
FANCM and FAAP20 proteins are enriched in the

FoxF1 is required for formation of DNA repair
foci in response to DNA damage
Mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 protein is known
to target FANCD2 to DNA repair foci [43, 44]. Consistent
with these studies, HU, MMC or CPT DNA damaging
agents induced formation of FANCD2 foci in nuclei of
HeLa tumor cells (Figure 4C–4D). SiRNA-mediated
depletion of FoxF1 impaired FANCD2 targeting to DNA
repair foci (Figure 4C–4D). Expression of exogenous
HF-FoxF1 protein in FoxF1-deficient cells rescued the
formation of FANCD2 foci in response to DNA damage
(Figure 4C–4D). These results demonstrate that FoxF1
induces FANCD2 translocation to DNA repair foci.

FoxF1 promotes cell survival and genome
maintenance after DNA damage
Defects in FA DNA repair pathway are associated
with various chromosomal and nuclear abnormalities,
often resulting in cell death [10, 41, 46]. Therefore, we
examined the number of chromosomal aberrations in
metaphase of FoxF1-depleted tumor cells exposed to
DNA-damaging agent. Similar to FA-deficient cells [7,
10, 41], increased number of chromosomal aberrations
was observed in MMC-treated tumor cells deficient for
FoxF1 (Figure 5A–5D). Overexpression of HF-FoxF1
decreased the number of chromosomal aberrations in
FoxF1-depleted cells (Figure 5A–5D). Furthermore,
FoxF1 knockdown increased the frequency of nuclear
abnormalities in cultured tumor cells (Figure 5F–5G).
This phenotype was also corrected by overexpression of
HF-FoxF1 (Figure 5F–5G). Thus, similar to FA proteins
FoxF1 regulates genome maintenance after DNA damage.
Since defects in the FA DNA repair pathway are
associated with hypersensitivity of tumor cells to DNA
crosslinking agents [46–48], we examined functional
consequences of FoxF1 depletion on cell survival after
DNA damage. Compared to control siRNA, FoxF1depleted tumor cells showed a dose-dependent reduction
in survival in response to MMC (Figure 5E). Cell survival
in FoxF1-deficient cells was rescued by overexpression of
HF-FoxF1, indicating that FoxF1 protects MMC-treated
cells from cell death.
Collectively, our findings indicate that the FA DNA
repair pathway is dependent on FoxF1 transcription factor,

of chromosomal and nuclear aberrations and decreased
survival in MMC-treated tumor cells. These results
indicate that FoxF1 is a critical mediator of the DNAdamage response in tumor cells.
In summary, our findings demonstrated that FoxF1
physically interacts with FA complexes and promotes
the FA DNA repair pathway. FoxF1 stabilizes the FA
core and I/D2 complexes and increases their activation
and targeting to chromatin. Inactivation of FoxF1 leads
to increased genomic instability and reduced survival of
DNA-damaged tumor cells. Discovery of pharmacological
agents that inactivate or decrease FoxF1 in tumor cells
can be beneficial for treatment of cancers resistant to
conventional chemotherapy.

chromatin fraction [7, 41, 42]. FoxF1 was also found in
the chromatin fraction, further supporting the involvement
of FoxF1 in the FA DNA repair pathway. Interestingly,
depletion of FoxF1 reduced the association of the FA
core and associated I/D2 sub-complexes with chromatin,
suggesting that FoxF1 promotes binding of the FA
complexes to chromatin. Furthermore, we found that the
interactions between FoxF1 and the FA complexes were
increased in response to DNA damage. Depletion of FoxF1
inhibited DNA repair and caused chromosomal aberrations
in tumor cells. Thus, similar to other FA proteins, FoxF1
is an essential structural and functional component of the
FA DNA repair complexes. Previous studies demonstrated
that after DNA damage the FA proteins form nuclear
foci in DNA repair sites [16, 43, 46] and that stability
of FA proteins was increased after DNA damage [7, 10,
41, 48]. Consistent with these studies, we found that
over-expression of FoxF1 in cultured tumor cells and
rabdomyosarcoma mouse tumors increased stability of
FA complex proteins. FoxF1 co-localized with FANCD2
in nuclear foci of DNA-damaged tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo, suggesting that FoxF1 plays a role in DNA repair
via interaction with FA complex proteins. Since FoxF1
levels are increased in alveolar rabdomyosarcomas, the
most aggressive type of human rabdomyosarcoma tumors
[53], FoxF1 could be involved in DNA repair of tumor
cells, mediating increased resistance of these aggressive
tumors to chemotherapy.
FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and FANCM
phosphorylation are required for activation of the FA
core complex and its targeting to DNA-damaged sites
[43, 44]. Consistent with a key role of FoxF1 in the
activation and function of the FA pathway, depletion of
FoxF1 decreased FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and
reduced FANCM phosphorylation, a phenotype similar
to inactivation of several FA complex proteins [7, 10,
45, 47]. After MMC treatment, mono-ubiquitination of
FANCD2 was severely impaired in FANCM- or MHF1depleted cells [41, 47]. Mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2
protein promoted the targeting of the FA complex to DNA
repair foci [16, 43]. Consistent with these studies, we
observed an accumulation of FANCD2 in nuclear foci
of DNA-damaged tumor cells. Interestingly, depletion
of FoxF1 resulted in a loss of FANCD2 in nuclear foci,
whereas over-expression of FoxF1 was sufficient to
restore foci formation in DNA-damaged cells. These
data indicate that FoxF1 promotes activation of the FA
complex and its translocation to DNA. Interestingly,
previous studies implicated various FA complex proteins,
such as FANCM, MHF1, FAAP20 and FAAP24, in tumor
cell survival after DNA damage. Depletion of one of
these individual FA proteins causes spontaneous DNA
damage, nuclear abnormalities, chromosomal aberrations
and hypersensitivity of tumor cells to DNA crosslinking
agents [7, 10, 41, 44, 46]. Consistent with these studies
we found that depletion of FoxF1 increased the number

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning, constructs and retroviruses
Analysis of FoxF1 protein sequences from
Mouse, Human, Chimpanzee, Xenopus and Zebrafish
showed ~71–94% homology between these species
(Supplementary Figure 1A). The amino acid homology
between murine and human FoxF1 was ~94%.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction using the ClustalW
method showed that murine FoxF1 is closest to its human
counterpart (Supplementary Figure 1B). Murine FoxF1
cDNA was used for this study to create stably transfected
cell lines expressing HF-tagged FoxF1 for purification and
further characterization of FoxF1 interacting proteins. The
pMIEG3 bicistronic retroviral vector was used for protein
expression in mammalian cells [41]. The mammalian
expression constructs used during the study were
pMIEG3:His6-FLAG-FoxF1 and pMIEG3:His6-FLAGFANCM. Murine FoxF1 was PCR-amplified and an
N-terminal Flag (5′-GGCGGATCCGCCACCATGGACT
ACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGACCCCGCGGCGG
CGGGC-3′) and a C-terminal (His)6 –tag (5′-GGGCCC
TCGAGTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGCATCACAC
ACGGCTTGATGTCTTGG-3′) were introduced by PCR,
then were cloned into a pMIEG3 vector to generate
pMIEG3-HF-Foxf1. PCR was performed using AccuPrime
Pfx DNA Polymerase according to manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen). All PCR products were sequenced.
Double-tagged FANCM construct was described
previously [42] and was a kind gift from Dr. Ruhikanta
Meetei. The retroviral particles were made in Cincinnati
Children’s Viral Vector Core facility and the generation of
stable cell lines was as described previously [41].

Chemicals
Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was suspended in water
to a stock concentration of 1 M. Mitomycin C (Sigma)
was dissolved in 50% ethanol to a stock concentration
of 500 ng/μL. Puromycin (Sigma) was dissolved at a
1921

Oncotarget

concentration of 10 mg/ml. MG132 (Sigma) was dissolved
in DMSO at a concentration of 20 mM. Camptothecin
(Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to stock concentration of
10 mM. Cisplatin (Calbiochem) was dissolved in DMSO
at a concentration of 10 mg/ml.

presence of 3 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted
using 2x sample buffer. Purified proteins were resolved on
SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by immunoblotting.

RNA preparation and quantitative real-time RTPCR (qRT-PCR)

Cell cultures, siRNA or shRNA knockdown

Depletion of FoxF1 from MFLM-91U cells was
performed by using siRNA transfection as described
above. At 48 h after transfection, total RNA was prepared
from siControl and siFoxF1 cells using RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) and analyzed by qRT-PCR using the StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as described
[55–57]. RNA was amplified with Taqman Gene
Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) combined
with inventoried Taqman mouse gene expression assays:
Foxf1, Mm00487497_m1; FANCM, Mm00626872_m1;
FAAP16, Mm00510275; FAAP100, Mm01243172;
FANCD2, Mm01184611_m1; FAAP20, Mm01266207_
m1. Reactions were analyzed in triplicates and expression
levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA.

HeLa, HT1080, LLC, MFLM-91U and Human
embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured and maintained
using standard procedures as described previously [7, 51].
Plasmid and siRNA transfection were performed
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For transient
knockdown of FoxF1, we used siRNAs targeting either
ORF (Mouse: 5′-GAAAGGAGUUUGUCUUCU C-3′
and Human: 5′-GGAAAUGCCAGGCGCUCAAUU-3′)
or siFoxF1–3′UTR (Mouse: 5′-CCAGAUACGUGGAAA
GAAUUU-3′ and Human: 5′ —GCAGAAAGGUUAAGG
CACUUU— 3′). siRNA against a non-targeting sequence
(Dharmacon) was used as control in all experiments.
All siRNA oligos were purchased from Dharmacon. For
retroviral-mediated stable knockdown of FoxF1, a short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting 3′UTR of human FoxF1
was used (5′- AAATGTTAGTGGTGGGTCTGA -3′).
Stable cell lines were generated using lentiviruses carrying
either pLKO.1:Puro-shControl or pLKO.1:Puro-shFoxf1–
3′UTR followed by puromycin selection.

Cell fractionation and gel filtration
For cell fractionation, cytoplasmic-nucleoplasmic
and chromatin-nuclear matrix proteins were purified as
described previously [58]. To study the co-fractionation of
FoxF1 and FA proteins, Superose 6 gel filtration analysis
was done as described previously [41].

Antibodies
Antibodies against FANCM, FANCA, FANCL,
FAAP24, FoxM1, FoxE1, FoxA3, Actin and Lamin
A/C were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Supplementary Table 1). Other Abs used in this study
were as follows: anti-FAAP100 and anti-FAAP20
(GeneTex, Inc), anti-FANCD2 (Abcam), anti-MHF1
and MHF2 (Aviva Systems Biology, Corp.), anti-FoxJ1
and anti-FoxA2 (Seven Hills Bioreagents), anti-FLAG
(Sigma) (Supplementary Table 1). M2-agarose beads
were purchased from Sigma. Talon metal affinity resin was
obtained from BD.

Mice
Male C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with
rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD-WT or RD-HF-FoxF1).
Mice were allowed to develop 10 mm tumors prior
to cisplatin treatment. Tumor-bearing mice were I.P.
injected with saline (control) or cisplatin (7 mg/kg body
weight in saline). The mice were sacrificed and the tumor
tissue was harvested 24 h after cisplatin treatment for
further analysis. For immunoblotting, tumor tissues
were homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and analyzed by
western blot as described previously [59, 31, 60]. Tumor
tissues were also used to prepare paraffin sections for
staining with FoxF1 (R&D Systems) and FANCD2
(Abcam) antibodies as described [51]. Antibody-antigen
complexes were detected using either Alexa Fluor 594
or 488 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen)
followed by counter staining with DAPI (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence was detected using
a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging Universal Microscope
with an Axiocam MRm digital camera (Axiovision
Release 4.3) as described [61–64]. Foxf1+/− mice were
previously generated by homologous recombination
[23, 24]. All animal studies were reviewed and approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati
Children’s Research Foundation.

Immunoprecipitation (IP)
IP experiments were performed from nuclear
extracts by using a two-step affinity chromatography
protocol as described previously [41]. Briefly, cells
expressing either HF-FoxF1 or HF-FANCM were washed
with PBS and collected as a pellet. The nuclear extract was
processed directly as described below or pre-incubated
with or without ethidium bromide (100 μg/mL) or DNase
(10 μ/mL) to check whether the interaction is mediated via
DNA. The first purification step included the incubation of
nuclear lysates with anti-Flag M2 agarose beads (Sigma)
followed by elution with 3xFlag peptide. The second
purification step was performed by incubating the 3xFlag
peptide eluate with Talon metal affinity resin (BD) in the
