ABSTRACT
Thioridazine, a member of the phenothiazine family, is a powerful anti-anxiety
and anti-psychotic drug. It can also suppress the growth of several types of tumor in
vitro. In the current study, we evaluated the direct anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic
effects of thioridazine in vivo. The injection of thioridazine into human ovarian tumor
xenografts in nude mice significantly inhibited tumor growth by ~fivefold, and also
decreased tumor vascularity. In addition, thioridazine inhibited the phosphorylation
of the signaling molecules downstream of phosphatidylinositol-3’-kinase (PI3K),
including Akt, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), during ovarian tumor progression via vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). These results provide convincing evidence
that thioridazine regulates endothelial cell function and subsequent angiogenesis
by inhibiting VEGFR-2/PI3K/mTOR signal transduction. Collectively, these results
strongly suggest that thioridazine might be a novel anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic
agent for use in ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

cell death. In addition, the anti-proliferative and antiangiogenic effects of thioridazine on ovarian carcinoma
cells might be caused by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and
FAK/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways
in vitro [6, 7]. However, the effect of thioridazine on
ovarian tumor progression in vivo remains unclear.
Angiogenesis is a physiological multi-step process
that includes endothelial cell growth and movement. It
plays important roles in wound healing and endothelialcell-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix, as
well as the transition of benign tissue into solid tumors
[8, 9]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a
key activator of endothelial cell functions such as new
blood vessel formation during development. It also plays
a vital role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion
of vascular endothelial cells [10]. Growth factors, such

Thioridazine hydrochloride (10-[2-(1-methyl2-piperidyl)ethyl]-2-methylthiophenothiazine) is one
of several anti-psychotic drugs collectively named
phenothiazine. It is commonly used to treat schizophrenia
and other psychotic disorders. Thioridazine decreases
excitation, agitation, hypermobility, and abnormal
conditions associated with excess energy. In individuals
with advanced tumors, it is also widely used to treat
tumor-associated sweating [1, 2] and depression [3].
Previous studies have shown that thioridazine exerts
several biological effects, including reducing the levels
of P-glycoprotein [4] and DNA breakdown [5]. Recently,
we reported that thioridazine inhibits cell proliferation
by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and induces apoptotic

as VEGF, integrins, and growth factor receptors (GFRs)
stimulate angiogenesis. Specifically, biological signals
known as angiogenic growth modulators activate receptors
on the surface of endothelial cells in pre-existing vessels
[8, 11].
Recent studies have suggested that the inhibition
of PI3K might play a vital role in tumor angiogenesis
[12-14]. During apoptotic cell death, the apoptosis signal
transduction pathway modulated by Akt is activated via
PI3K; Akt is a pivotal downstream target of PI3K during
angiogenesis. Akt regulates multiple cellular processes
including tumor angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, cell
growth, cell migration, and cell metabolism [15, 16]. In
animal experiments, the siRNA-mediated suppression of
Akt effectively downregulated ovarian tumor growth and
angiogenesis [12, 14]. Therefore, the PI3K/Akt signaling
cascade plays a vital role in tumor angiogenesis. mTOR
is also a critical regulator of cell growth and death; it
functions by modulating a variety of signal transduction

pathways [17, 18].
The current study used an in vivo model of human
ovarian cancer cell xenografts in nude mice to assess the
effects and mechanism of action of thioridazine on tumor
growth and angiogenesis.

RESULTS
Thioridazine inhibits the growth of 2774
xenografts in nude mice
To investigate whether thioridazine exerts direct
anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects, we evaluated
its effects on the growth of ovarian cancer xenograft
tumors in vivo. Ovarian cancer cells (2774) were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice, and were allowed to
develop into ovarian tumor xenografts. The volume of

treatments were performed orally every 3 days. Data represent the mean tumor volume of four to five mice. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01 compared
with the controls. (B) The tumors excised from control and thioridazine-treated mice on day 28 of treatment were photographed (upper
panel). Tumor weights are reported as the mean of three mice (n = 5 per group) (lower left panel) ± SDs. *, P<0.05 vs. control. Sections of
thioridazine-treated and control tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; lower middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (lower

tumors in the control group increased significantly after
14 days (mean volume = 100 mm3). Beginning on day
14, mice in the treatment group were treated orally with
25 mg/kg thioridazine every 3 days for 4 weeks. Tumor
growth in the thioridazine-treated group was suppressed
~fivefold compared with control (Fig. 1A).
Tumors were excised from both groups on day 28
after the final treatment. The volume of thioridazinetreated tumors was 70% less than those from control mice.
Treatment resulted in no overt toxicity in organ tissue
sections, no significant toxic lesions (data not shown).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tumor sections from
the control group revealed high-grade carcinoma with
an irregular cell distribution and mitotic morphology. In
contrast, tumors from the thioridazine-treated group had
large areas of late-apoptotic or necrotic cells. Cleaved
caspase-3 immunohistochemical findings indicated the
apoptotic effect by thioridazine (Fig. 1B). Treated and
control group tissues were also stained for proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67, markers of cell
proliferation. The expression of PCNA and Ki-67 was
significantly lower in the thioridazine treatment group
compared with the controls (Fig. 1C).
We next determined whether thioridazine induces
apoptotic cell death by evaluating the proteolytic activity
of caspase-9 and caspase-3, precursors of major regulators
of apoptosis, as well as the inactivation of poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), using immunoblotting.
As shown in Fig. 1D, in a manner consistent with the
morphological characteristics of apoptotic cell death such
as fragmented nuclei, increased dosages of thioridazine
stimulated cleavage of PARP. We monitored PARP
cleavage as a significant indicator, as well as a useful
marker for cellular apoptotic cell death outcomes. We
also measured the activation of caspase-3, which plays
an essential role in the execution of apoptosis [19]. The
expression of the cell-death-associated proteins PARP,
caspase-9, and caspase-3 was enhanced significantly in
thioridazine-treated tumors. These results suggest that

thioridazine inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis
in vivo.

Effect of thioridazine on the expression of cell
cycle-regulatory and apoptosis-associated proteins
To clarify the biological mechanism underlying the
growth inhibitory effects of thioridazine, the expression
of cell-cycle-associated proteins in tumor tissue lysates
was assessed. The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin
dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which are associated with
the transition from G1 to S phase, was downregulated
significantly, whereas the expression of the CDK inhibitors
p16 and p27, which interrupt cell cycle procession at the
G1 or G2/M phase, was increased (Fig. 2A). In addition,
the expression of Bax and p53 was upregulated in the
thioridazine-treated group compared with the controls
(Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, the expression of antiapoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-proliferation markers, such
as Bcl-2, survivin, c-Myc, cyclooxygenase (COX-2),
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), was downregulated
in thioridazine-treated tumors (Fig. 2B, C). Taken together,
these data suggest that thioridazine plays an important role
in preventing ovarian tumor progression.

Thioridazine suppresses tumor angiogenesis in
vivo
We reported previously that thioridazine inhibits
the expression of angiogenesis-related factors in vitro
[7]. To confirm the anti-angiogenic effects of thioridazine
on tumor angiogenesis in vivo, the expression of
proteins involved in angiogenesis was assessed in
tumor cell lysates using immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting. Immunohistochemical staining of
endothelial cells in tumor sections of thioridazine-treated

Bax, p53, survivin, c-Myc, COX-2, ICAM-1, and XIAP was analyzed by immunoblotting; β-actin was used as the loading control.

mice revealed a ~fourfold reduction in the number of
blood vessels stained with CD31 (Fig. 3A). Consistent
with this, immunoblotting revealed that the expression
of VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)
and the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 were reduced in
thioridazine-treated tumors compared with the controls
(Fig. 3B). We next analyzed the activation of downstream
targets of PI3K after treatment with thioridazine
using immunoblotting. Treatment with thioridazine
downregulated the phosphorylation, but not total levels,
of PDK1, Akt, and mTOR (Fig. 3C). These results suggest
that thioridazine stimulates changes in apoptotic cell
death, cell cycle progression, and the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrate that
thioridazine potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor
growth in vivo.

on anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity that could
target the VEGFR-2/PI3K/mTOR signal transduction in
ovarian tumor xenografts in vivo. As expected, the volume
of thioridazine-treated tumors was 70% less than those of
the controls. The expression of the proliferative markers
PCNA and Ki-67 was significantly lower in thioridazinetreated tumors, whereas the expression of anti-apoptotic,
oncogenic, and anti-proliferative proteins (including
Bcl-2, survivin, c-Myc, COX-2, ICAM-1, and XIAP)
was decreased significantly compared with the controls.
Collectively, these results suggest that thioridazine inhibits
ovarian tumor progression.
VEGF plays a role in tumor angiogenesis by
activating the proliferation and migration of endothelial
cells during microvessel formation in organ development
[9]. In cancer, the activity of endothelial cells plays a
pivotal role in regulating various vascular biological
and pathological functions. Although VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2 are structurally similar, they have distinct
functions during angiogenesis. VEGFR-2 plays a vital
role in activating the major downstream components
responsible for cell growth, endothelial cell invasion,
migration, differentiation, and embryonic angiogenesis
[20-22]. In contrast, VEGFR-1 has no role in the
proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [23].
In addition, HIF proteins regulate the expression of
VEGF, whereas hypoxic conditions upregulate HIF-1α

DISCUSSION
Thioridazine is used extensively to treat psychotic
diseases such as psychosis and schizophrenia owing to its
potent anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic effects. Recently,
we demonstrated that thioridazine dramatically suppressed
cell growth by inducing apoptosis, and that its angiostatic
effects were mediated by the inhibition of FAK/mTOR
signaling in ovarian cancer cells in vitro [6, 7]. In the
current study, we explored the direct effects of thioridazine

anti-CD31 antibodies. Thioridazine-treated tumors exhibited ~fourfold reduced CD31 staining. Bar = 50 μm. *, P<0.05 vs. control. (B)
Thioridazine downregulated the expression of VEGF and HIF-1α and the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, as assessed by the immunoblotting
of tumor samples. β-actin was used as the loading control. (C) Thioridazine decreased the phosphorylation of major components of the
PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-PI3K, -phosphoPDK1, -phospho-Akt, and -phospho-mTOR antibodies. The total non-phosphorylated proteins (PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and mTOR) were used
as loading controls. Protein expression levels were analyzed by densitometry.

expression. Activated HIF-1α promotes the proliferation
and invasion of endothelial cells, as well as migration
and capillary tubule formation in malignant tumors. As
expected, the current study revealed that VEGF and HIF1α levels and VEGFR-2 phosphorylation were inhibited
significantly in thioridazine-treated tumors compared
with the controls in vivo. PI3K/Akt signaling plays a vital
role in the various physiological functions of malignant
tumors. Akt activity is modulated by PI3K, which anchors
Akt to the cell membrane and allows it to be activated by
PDK1 [24]. Thioridazine treatment in vivo downregulated
the phosphorylation, but not expression, of PDK1, Akt,
and mTOR.
In conclusion, the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic
effects of thioridazine were confirmed in vivo using mouse
ovarian tumor xenografts, followed by immunoblotting
and immunohistochemistry. These data supply evidence
for the molecular mechanism by which thioridazine
inhibits human ovarian carcinoma growth in vivo.
Results revealed that the anti-tumor and angiostatic
effects of thioridazine were regulated by reducing the
phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and inhibiting PI3K/mTOR
signaling. Collectively, these results strongly suggest
that thioridazine might be a novel anti-cancer and antiangiogenic agent for ovarian carcinoma.

anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). In addition, the following
primary antibodies were used for immunohistochemical
analysis: anti-CD31 (PECAM-1), anti-Ki67, anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and antiPCNA (Dako, Denmark).

Mouse xenografts and immunohistochemistry
Briefly, 5–6-week-old BALB/c-nu/nu mice were
implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1.9 × 106 2774
tumor cells. When the tumors reached a volume of ~100
mm3, on day 14, animals were treated orally with 25 mg/
kg thioridazine every 3 days for 27 days. Tumors were
measured in three dimensions using calipers, and tumor
volume (in mm3) was calculated using the following
formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (a × b2)/2, where a =
length in mm, and b = width in mm. Body weight was
measured every other day. Mice were sacrificed 1 day after
the final injection. Tumors were then excised and weighed;
half of each tumor was frozen, and half was fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned for H&E staining and immunohistochemistry.
The antibodies described above were used in an automatic
immunohistochemical-staining instrument (Ventana,
Tucson, AZ) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sections were subsequently visualized at 200×
magnification; staining was assessed in >200 cells from
each section.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, mice, reagents and antibodies

Immunoblotting analysis

Human ovarian cancer cells (2774) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA), and were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Specific
pathogen-free BALB/c-nu/nu mice (5–6 weeks old)
were supplied by Orientbio (Sungnam, Korea). The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
at the Research Institute of the National Cancer Center
approved all animal studies. Thioridazine was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The following
primary antibodies against the following proteins were
used for western blotting: anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-9,
anti-c-Myc, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-p53, anti-survivin,
anti-COX-2 (all from Cell Signaling Technologies,
Beverly, MA), anti-PARP, anti-XIAP (both from BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-cyclin D1, anti-CDK4,
anti-p16, anti-p27, anti-phospho-PI3K, anti-PI3K, antiphospho-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-PDK1, anti-PDK1,
anti-phospho-mTOR, anti-mTOR, anti-ICAM-1, anti-HIF1α, anti-VEGF, anti-VEGFR-2, anti-phospho-VEGFR-2
(all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and

Tissues were collected, rinsed in PBS, and
centrifuged. The pellets were then resuspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.2] 150 mM KCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A)
containing a protease inhibitor cocktail, and incubated for
30 min. The protein concentration was determined using a
Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cell lysates were mixed with 6×
SDS loading buffer, and then were separated on 10–12%
gels using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to
Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA).
After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with the indicated primary antibodies.
The blots were then rinsed three times in wash buffer, and
incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. The protein bands were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ).
