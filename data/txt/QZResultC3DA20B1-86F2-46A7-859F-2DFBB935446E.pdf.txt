Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer is a multistep process that involves mutations and other alterations in oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes1. Genome sequencing studies have identified a large collection of genetic
alterations that occur in human cancers2–4. However, the determination of which mutations are
causally related to tumorigenesis remains a major challenge. Here we describe a novel CRISPR/
Cas9-based approach for rapid functional investigation of candidate genes in well-established
autochthonous mouse models of cancer. Using a KrasG12D-driven lung cancer model5, we
performed functional characterization of a panel of tumor suppressor genes with known loss-offunction alterations in human lung cancer. Cre-dependent somatic activation of oncogenic
KrasG12D combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of tumor suppressor genes
resulted in lung adenocarcinomas with distinct histopathological and molecular features. This
rapid somatic genome engineering approach enables functional characterization of putative cancer
genes in the lung and other tissues using autochthonous mouse models. We anticipate that this
approach can be used to systematically dissect the complex catalog of mutations identified in
cancer genome sequencing studies.

Lung cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed a multitude of recurrent mutations
and copy number alterations2–4. However, the determination of which mutations are
causally related to tumorigenesis remains a major challenge. Genetically-engineered mouse
models (GEMMs) of lung cancer have assisted in the functional characterization of putative
driver events identified in human lung tumors6,7,but these require modification of the
germline and cannot be performed in a highly parallel manner.

Author Manuscript

Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated the feasibility of using the CRISPR
(clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system to directly mutate
cancer genes in the liver following hydrodynamic delivery of plasmids carrying the CRISPR
components8, which relies on the efficient transfection of hepatocytes. To rapidly interrogate
cancer genes in the lung and other tissues, we developed pSECC (Fig. 1a), a lentiviral-based
system that delivers both the CRISPR system and Cre recombinase. In this setting, CRISPRinduced mutation of genes can be examined in the context of several of the well-studied
conditional Cre/loxP mouse models of lung cancer9 and other cancer types. To test this
system, we used GEMMs of lung adenocarcinoma, in which tumors are induced in
KrasLSL-G12D/+ (K) or KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53flox/flox (KP) mice upon intratracheal
administration of lentiviral vectors expressing Cre-recombinase10,11.

Author Manuscript

To validate pSECC, we developed the Green-Go (GG) reporter cell line, which expresses
GFP following exposure to Cre (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). To assess the efficiency of Cas9
in tumors in vivo, we targeted a Cre-activatable tdTomato knock-in reporter allele12 with
pSECC lentiviruses expressing an sgRNA against tdTomato (sgTom) or an empty vector
control (Extended Data Fig. 1d–e). At 10 weeks post-infection, we assessed knockdown of
tdTomato expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observed that 28% of tumors
lacked tdTomato expression, suggesting that the system was functional in vivo by editing an
endogenous allele in the context of a lung tumor (Extended Data Fig. 2a–e). Importantly,
animals infected with empty pSECC rarely contained non-tumor Tomato-expressing cells
(data not shown), indicating that there is minimal infection of non-epithelial cells when
using a low lentiviral titer.

We then proceeded to functionally characterize tumor suppressor genes using this approach.
Loss of NK2 homeobox 1(Nkx2.1),a master regulator of lung development13, or Phosphatase
and tensin homolog(Pten), a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling14
accelerates lung tumorigenesis in K and KP lung tumor models10,15,16. We infected K and
KP animals with pSECC vectors expressing validated sgPten, sgNkx2.1 and controls
(sgTom and empty vector) to induce lung tumors. Ten weeks post-infection, we sacrificed
animals to assess the effects of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in tumors by
histopathology, surveyor assays and deep sequencing of the targeted alleles (Fig. 1a). All
animals expressing sgRNAs targeting Pten or Nkx2.1 contained tumors with marked
histopathological differences compared to controls (Fig. 1b, d, and Extended Data Fig. 3a–
d).
Animals infected with sgNkx2.1-pSECC developed mucinous adenocarcinomas (MA)
typified by the presence of elongated cells, mucin production and glandular rearrangements,

in agreement with previous Cre/loxP-based (Nkx2.1flox/flox) data16(Fig. 1b). The majority of
tumors (61%, 54/88 tumors) from sgNkx2.1-pSECC animals lacked Nkx2.1 expression
(compared to 0/33 tumors from controls) (Fig. 1b–c). Importantly, 85% (46/54 tumors) of
these Nkx2.1-negative tumors stained positively for mucin (Fig. 1c), a biomarker of
mucinous adenocarcinomas16. Thus, although a subset of tumors appeared to partially or
fully escape CRISPR-mediated deletion of Nkx2.1, we were able to observe clear
phenotypes by examining the full spectrum of tumors generated by sgNkx2.1-pSECC.

Author Manuscript

Animals infected with sgPten-pSECC demonstrated complete loss of Pten protein in 74% of
tumors (40/54 tumors), which was accompanied by a concomitant increase in pAkt (S473),a
downstream biomarker of increased PI3-kinase pathway activity (Fig. 1d–e). These results
mimic previously published data using a Ptenflox/flox allele in K mice15. Collectively, these
data indicate that CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing leads to loss-of-function mutations in
this model and closely parallels what is seen with the use of traditional conditional alleles.

Author Manuscript

We next utilized this system to study adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), a tumor suppressor
whose functional role in lung adenocarcinoma has not been characterized. Of note, Apc is
found in a region that frequently undergoes copy number loss in human lung cancer4. We
infected animals with pSECC lentiviruses expressing a validated sgRNA17 targeting Apc. At
10 weeks post-infection, we observed a dramatic difference in the histopathology of sgApc
tumors compared to controls (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Importantly, tumors from
KrasLSL-G12D/+; Apcflox/flox mice, which express a conditional allele of Apc18, exhibited
identical histopathology (Fig. 1f). Tumors with Cas9-mediated deletion of Apc were highly
de-differentiated, invasive and had a significant stromal component (Fig. 1f). The majority
of these tumors (78%, 91/117) stained strongly for nuclear β-catenin, a marker of Apc
mutation in colon cancer and other settings19 (Fig. 1f–g). Furthermore, 77% (70/91) of
tumors with nuclear β-catenin stained positive for the transcription factor Sox9, which might
reflect a distal embryonic differentiation state20,21. Of note, we observed a statistically
significantly higher number of Sox9-positive tumors in KP-sgApc (29/33, or 88%) than in
K-sgApc mice (41/58 tumors, or 71%), suggesting a possible role for p53 in regulating this
change in differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 6b–c).

Author Manuscript

To further characterize the differentiation state of sgApc tumors, we stained serial sections
for lung differentiation markers, including Sox2, Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP),
Surfactant Protein C (SP-C), p63, Nkx2.1 and Sox9 (Extended Data Fig. 6a)22. Tumors from
KP-sgTom mice stained positively for CCSP, SP-C and Nkx2.1 and negatively for Sox2,
p63 and Sox9. In contrast, tumors from sgApc mice frequently stained positively for SP-C,
Nkx2.1 and Sox9 and negatively for CCSP, Sox2 and p63. A significant number of tumors
from sgApc mice had areas with low levels or complete absence of Nkx2.1, which
correlated with the levels of the Nkx2.1 transcriptional target SP-C22 (16/52 tumors, or
31%) (Extended Data Fig. 6d). These data indicate that these tumors are poorly
differentiated and that hyperactivation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway through loss
of Apcin Kras-driven lung adenocarcinomas results in tumors with varying degrees of
differentiation. These results also mimic what we observed in tumors from Apc conditional
mice (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 6e) and recapitulate recent observations in a

Our initial analysis demonstrated significant histological and pathway-specific differences
upon deletion of these tumor suppressors in lung tumors. To assess the overall impact of
these alterations on tumorigenesis, we measured tumor burden and grade in both K and KP
animals. Deletion of Pten and Apc significantly increased overall tumor burden, which
correlated with higher tumor grades (Grade 3 and 4) (Fig. 2a–c and Extended Data Fig. 3f–
g). Nkx2.1 deletion had a significant effect on overall tumor burden only in KP animals;
however, we observed a striking transition to highly dedifferentiated MA tumors in both K
and KP mice (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 3f–g and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d).
Conversely, Apc deletion had a significant effect on tumor burden only in K mice (Fig. 2a
and Extended Data Fig. 3f–g). Deletion of all three genes led to increased BrdU
incorporation, suggesting that the increased tumor burden is partly due to increased
proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 3h). These data demonstrate the tumor suppressive role of
Nkx2.1, Pten and Apc in the context of oncogenic Kras. Furthermore, the unique
histopathology observed for each targeted tumor suppressor gene in this Kras-driven model
illustrates the potential of this approach to rapidly model the effects of cooperative genetic
events in lung tumorigenesis and progression.

Author Manuscript

Using this in vivo somatic genome editing approach, we observed inter- and intra-tumoral
heterogeneity in terms of CRISPR-based loss-of-function of Pten in sgPten animals (Fig.
2d–e and Extended Data Fig. 5). Clones that acquired loss of Pten had increased PI3K/Akt
signaling and may, therefore, have had a selective advantage over tumors that retained wildtype Pten within the same animal. We observed that tumors with complete or sub-clonal loss
of Pten were significantly larger than tumors that retained Pten (Fig. 2d–e).

Author Manuscript

The histopathological and IHC analyses indicate that the pSECC system is highly efficient
in vivo, leading to robust target-specific phenotypic differences in lung tumors. To confirm
Cas9-mediated editing of the alleles and precisely characterize the events at singlenucleotide resolution, we performed deep sequencing of targetloci from whole lung and
tumor DNA. Within a 23bp window (± 10bp flanking the Protospacer Adjacent Motif
[PAM] sequence at each locus), the rate of mutations observed in the sgTarget samples was
significantly greater than in the control samples (Fig. 3a–c). Using the control samples as a
background model to analyze the mutational rate revealed that sgTarget samples were
enriched for mutations within 7bp upstream of the PAM sequences in predicted cutting sites,
strongly suggesting that they are not secondary consequences of tumor progression (Fig. 3d
and Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). The maximum per-base mutation frequency observed in
sgTarget samples was 71.7% in Nkx2.1, 66.06% in Pten and 39.91% in Apc (in contrast to
control samples: 0.11%, 0.73% and 0.14%, respectively). On average, 27.48% ± 10.3
(Nkx2.1), 44.64% ± 5.3 (Pten) and 13.54% ± 5.3 (Apc) read fragments covering this 7bp
locus harbored indels in sgTarget samples. Across all sgTarget samples, > 94% of observed
indels constituted nonsynonymous frame-altering events (Extended Data Fig. 7d–e and
Supplementary Tables 3–4).

Several studies have reported that Cas9 can bind to sites in the genome other than the
intended target site24–27, which could result in unintended editing at an off-target (OT) site.
To assess OT editing, we analyzed the top three predicted24 loci (Supplementary Tables 2)
for each sgRNA by deep sequencing. We observed negligible OT editing (Extended Data
Fig. 8). On average, 0.048% ± 0.031 (for sgNkx2.1), 0.26% ± 0.096 (for sgPten) and 0.051%
± 0.027 (for sgApc) of read fragments harbored indels in the OT sites (Supplementary
Tables 5–7). This data suggests that the observations reported for each of the sgRNAs arise
from deletion of the intended target and not from editing of another gene.

The goal of cancer genomics is to identify genetic events that underlie cancer initiation and
progression. The functional interrogation of putative cancer genes in appropriate
experimental models will elucidate which mutations identify bona fide cancer genes. This
study presents a novel approach to rapidly evaluate human cancer genome candidates and
assess cooperativity between genetic events in the context of well-established mouse models
of lung cancer. Moreover, our ability to model different lung adenocarcinoma subtypes
allows for the detailed study of subtype-specific molecular mechanisms controlling disease
initiation and progression. We anticipate that this approach can be readily adapted to many
existing Cre/loxP-based GEMMs of several cancer types to facilitate the rapid functional
assessment of new hypotheses generated by cancer genome studies.

Methods
Lentiviral vectors and sgRNA cloning

Author Manuscript

The U6-sgRNA-EFS-Cas9-2A-Cre (pSECC) lentiviral vector was constructed by
assembling four parts with overlapping DNA ends using Gibson assembly. Briefly, a 2.2kb
part (corresponding to the U6-Filler fragment from LentiCRISPR28), a 0.3kb part
(corresponding to the EFS promoter from LentiCRISPR28), a 5.3kb part (corresponding to a
Cas9-2A-Cre fragment, which was generated by assembly PCR) and a 5.7kb lentiviral
backbone were assembled using Gibson assembly following manufacturer guidelines.
Detailed cloning strategies and primer sequences are available on request. For sgRNA
cloning, the pSECC vector was digested with BsmBI and ligated with BsmBI-compatible
annealed oligos (Supplementary Table 1). sgRNAs were designed using CRISPR Design24
(which was also used to predict potential off-target sites; see Extended Data Fig. 8 and
Supplementary Tables 2) or E-CRISP29, except for sgApc which was previously reported17.
An extra G (required for U6 transcriptional initiation) was added to the 5′ end of sgRNAs
that lacked it.
Lentiviral production

Author Manuscript

Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral backbone
constructs and packaging vectors (delta8.2 and VSV-G) using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio).
Supernatant was collected 48 and 72 hours post-transfection, concentrated by
ultracentrifugation at 25,000 RPM for 90 minutes and resuspended in an appropriate volume
of OptiMEM (Gibco).

Cell culture and generation of Green-Go cells

Author Manuscript

Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and
gentamicin. Green-Go cells were generated by transducing 3TZ cells30 with a bicistronic
retrovirus containing an LTR promoter-driven inverted GFP (flanked by two sets of
incompatible loxP sites) and a PGK-driven puromycin resistance cassette. Transduced cells
were selected with puromycin and a single cell clone that expressed high levels of GFP 2–3
days after infection with a lentivirus expressing Cre recombinase was chosen.
Immunobloting

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (Pierce, #89900) supplemented with 1×
Complete Mini inhibitor mixture (Roche, #11 836 153 001) and mixed on a rotator at 4°C
for 30 minutes. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was quantified using the Bio-Rad
DC Protein Assay (Catalog #500-0114). 50–80 μg of total protein was separated on 4–12%
Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: antiFLAG (Sigma, F1804, 1:1,000), anti-Hsp90 (BD, #610418, 1:10,000), anti-Pten (Cell
Signaling, 9188, 1:1,000), anti-TTF1/Nkx-2.1 (Epitomics, EP1584Y, 1:1,000).
Mice

Author Manuscript

All animal studies described in this study were approved by the MIT Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. All animals were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6J x 129SvJ
genetic background. KrasLSL-G12D/+and p53flox/flox mice have already been described5,31.
Mice were infected intratracheally with lentiviruses as described32. We infected a total of 7
mice with Empty-pSECC and 6 mice with sgTom-pSECC (for a total of 13 control mice), as
well as 8 mice with sgNkx2.1-pSECC, 9 mice with Pten-pSECC and 9 mice with ApcpSECC. No randomization or blinding was used. Total lung area occupied by tumor was
measured on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides using NIS-elements software.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Lungs were perfused through the
trachea with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), fixed overnight, transferred to 70% ethanol and
subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of four micrometers and
stained with H&E for pathological examination. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was
performed on a Thermo Autostainer 360 machine. Slides were antigen retrieved using
Thermo citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in the Pretreatment Module. Sections were treated with
Biocare rodent block, primary antibody, and anti-Mouse (Biocare) or anti-Rabbit (Vector
Labs) HRP-polymer. The slides were developed with Thermo Ultra DAB and counterstained
with hematoxylin in a Thermo Gemini stainer and coverslipped using the Thermo Consul
cover slipper. The following antibodies were used for IHC: anti-TTF1/Nkx-2.1 (Epitomics,
EP1584Y, 1:1,200), anti-Pten (Cell Signaling, 9559, 1:100), anti-pAkt S473 (Cell Signaling,
4060, 1:100), anti-BrdU (Abcam, 6326, 1:100), anti-β-catenin (BD, 610154, 1:100), antiSox9 (Millipore, AB5535, 1:500), anti-RFP (Rockland, 600-401-379, 1:400), anti-Sox2

All pictures were obtained using a Nikon 80i microscope with a DS-U3 camera and NISelements software.
Genomic DNA isolation and Surveyor assay
Genomic DNA from entire snap-frozen left lung lobes or microdissected tumors was
isolated using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche) following manufacturer
guidelines. PCR products for surveyor assay were amplified using Herculase II Fusion DNA
polymerase (Agilent) (see Supplementary Table 1 for primers used for surveyor assay), gel
purified and subsequently assayed with the Surveyor Mutation Detection Kit
(Transgenomic). DNA was separated on 4–20% Novex TBE Gels (Life Technologies) and
stained with ethidium bromide.

Deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of Cas9 target loci

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For each target gene or potential off-target site, a genomic region containing the target
sequence was amplified using Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase and gel purified
(primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 1). Sequencing libraries were
prepared from 50ng of PCR product using the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit
(Illumina) and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq machines. In order to retain high quality
sequence for mutation analysis, Illumina MiSeq reads (150bp paired-end) were trimmed to
100mer paired end reads to drop lower quality 3′ ends of reads. Traces of Nextera adapters
were clipped from PE1 and PE2 100mer reads using the FASTX toolkit (Hannon Lab,
CSHL). Reads greater than 15 nucleotides in length were retained. Additionally, reads with
50% or more bases below a base quality threshold of Q30 were dropped from subsequent
analysis. Reference sequences with 10bp genomic flanks were indexed using the BurrowsWheeler Aligner (BWA) IS linear time algorithm33 and reads were aligned using the BWA
aligner. Reads with mapping quality greater than zero were retained. Overlapping
alignments of paired end reads due to short inserts were resolved in order to avoid double
counting of coverage and/or mutations observed in a single fragment. In order to minimize
alignment ambiguity in the presence of mutations (including indels), the GATK Toolkit34
was used to realign pooled cohorts mapping to a given locus. Mutations (base substitutions,
insertions and deletions) were assessed using a combination of Samtools35 and Annovar36
(indel quantification and annotation), NGSUtils/BAMutils software suite37 (total mutations
per position), and custom scripts. Mutation frequencies were adjusted for sample purity (see
next section) and per base substitution, insertion, and deletion frequencies were determined.
Significance of overall mutation rates across 10bp flanking the target locus was assessed
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing control and sgTarget sample events. Positional
enrichment for mutation frequency compared to control samples was assessed using the
conditional maximum likelihood odds ratio estimate (Fisher’s exact test) and was mean
centered and scaled (z-scores) across a 10bp flank on either side of the PAM sequence in
each sample. A number of other utilities/tools were used to enable various parts of the
analysis, including: BEDTools38, the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV)39, and Picard (http://
picard.sourceforge.net/). Statistical analyses and sequence enrichment plots were
implemented in R (http://www.R-project.org). Illumina MiSeq sequence datasets have been
deposited into the NCBI repository under BioProjectID PRJNA256245.

Tumor purity correction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Lung lobe and microdissected tumor genomic DNA was used to perform real-time PCR
based analysis to detect the relative levels of the un-recombined KrasLSL-G12D allele (from
non-tumor tissue) using forward primer 5′-CTCTTGCCTACGCCACCAGCTC-3′ and
reverse primer 5′-AGCTAGCCACCATGGCTTGAGTAAGTCTGCA-3′. To correct for
DNA loading of each sample, we amplified the chr5:10054507-10054621 region using
forward primer 5′-GAAGAAATTAGAGGGCATGCTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′
CTTCTCCCAGTGACCTTATGTA-3′. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using
KAPA Fast SYBR master mix in a Roche LightCycler Real-Time PCR instrument. To
calculate percent purity we performed the following calculations for each sample:
ΔCptumorX= CpChr5−CpK-rasLSL-G12D/+ to normalize for sample loading followed by 1/
ΔΔCp= 1/(ΔCptumorX−ΔCpLungControl) for each sample to compare relative purity to lung
tissue from KrasLSL-G12D/+ animals that were not infected with Cre. To validate the assay,
we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts from KrasLSL-G12D/+ mice treated with Cre
recombinase (or control FlpOrecombinase). Purity values are reported in Supplementary
Table 3.
Statistics
P-values were determined by Student’s t-test for all measurements of tumor burden and IHC
quantifications except for contingency tables, in which Fisher’s exact test or Chi-square test
were used. All error bars denote s.e.m.
