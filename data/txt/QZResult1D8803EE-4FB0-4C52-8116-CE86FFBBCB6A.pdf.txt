Interactions of Abiraterone, Eplerenone, and Prednisolone with
Wild-Type and Mutant Androgen Receptor: A Rationale for Increasing
Abiraterone Exposure or Combining with MDV3100—Letter
David End1, Arturo Molina2, Mary Todd3, and Michael L. Meyers3

We read with interest the report from Richards and colleagues (1) on the potential interactions of abiraterone, eplerenone, and prednisolone with wild-type and mutant androgen
receptor (AR). Abiraterone is a CYP17A1 inhibitor that blocks
androgen biosynthesis in the testes, adrenals, and castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors, producing androgen
ablation with signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt in patients with metastatic CRPC. The current report (1) and other studies (2)
suggesting that abiraterone downregulates AR expression and
produces antiandrogen activity beyond androgen depletion
merit further investigation.
The suppression of adrenal steroid biosynthesis via abiraterone inhibition of CYP17A1 reduces circulating cortisol, with
compensatory release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (3).
This induces increased adrenal secretion of mineralocorticoids
that can contribute to hypokalemia and hypertension. These
manifestations of mineralocorticoid excess are managed by
coadministration of low-dose prednisone (a prodrug of prednisolone) in patients treated with abiraterone acetate.
Richards and colleagues reported that prednisolone activated the AR in cells transfected with T877A-mutant AR with an
EC50 of 25.1 mmol/L. This suggested that coadministration of
prednisolone with abiraterone acetate could contribute to
disease progression. However, the EC50 is much higher than

the plasma concentrations of prednisolone (4–305 nmol/L)
measured in 15 patients with CRPC receiving abiraterone
acetate plus prednisolone. Furthermore, the authors extrapolated the reported prednisolone plasma concentrations to a
prior publication on the in vitro androgen agonist activity of
glucocorticoids at nanomolar concentrations in a cell line
bearing an AR ligand-binding domain double mutation
(T877A plus L701H) to ascribe clinical signiﬁcance (4). We
feel that this comparison is inappropriate in relation to the
current ﬁndings and the interpretation of the ﬁndings related
to abiraterone acetate therapy. The prevalence of this double
mutation is unknown without established clinical relevance.
The authors also reported ﬁndings using spironolactone and
eplerenone, which produced androgen agonist activity in vitro
in cells transfected with wild-type (spironolactone only) or
mutant AR at concentrations relevant to clinical activity. The
report suggested that this could contribute to disease progression if these drugs were used in patients with prostate cancer.
However, neither agent is proposed for use with abiraterone
acetate to ameliorate symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess.
Abiraterone acetate was studied in conjunction with lowdose prednisone/prednisolone in registration trials leading to
approval (5); only prednisone/prednisolone, not spironolactone or eplerenone, are speciﬁed in approved labeling. Given
the high concentrations of prednisolone investigated in the
reported in vitro studies, the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings
is not obvious.
