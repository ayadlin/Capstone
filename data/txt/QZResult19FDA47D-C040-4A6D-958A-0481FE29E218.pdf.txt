ABSTRACT
Purpose: DNA repair defects due to detrimental BRCA2-mutations confer
increased susceptibility towards DNA interstrand-crosslinking (ICL) agents and
define patient subpopulations for individualized genotype-based cancer therapy.
However, due to the side effects of these drugs, there is a need to identify additional
agents, which could be used alone or in combination with ICL-agents. Therefore, we
investigated whether BRCA2-mutations might also increase the sensitivity towards
TRAIL-receptors (TRAIL-R)-targeting compounds.
Experimental design: Two independent model systems were applied: a BRCA2
gene knockout and a BRCA2 gene complementation model. The effects of TRAILR-targeting compounds and ICL-agents on cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle
distribution were compared in BRCA2-proficient versus -deficient cancer cells in vitro.
In addition, the effects of the TRAIL-R2-targeting antibody LBY135 were assessed
in vivo using a murine tumor xenograft model.
Results: BRCA2-deficient cancer cells displayed an increased sensitivity towards
TRAIL-R-targeting agents. These effects exceeded and were mechanistically
distinguishable from the well-established effects of ICL-agents. In vitro, ICL-agents
expectedly induced an early cell cycle arrest followed by delayed apoptosis, whereas
TRAIL-R-targeting compounds caused early apoptosis without prior cell cycle arrest.
In vivo, treatment with LBY135 significantly reduced the tumor growth of BRCA2deficient cancer cells in a xenograft model.
Conclusions: BRCA2 mutations strongly increase the in vitro- and in vivosensitivity of cancer cells towards TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis. This effect is
mechanistically distinguishable from the well-established ICL-hypersensitivity of
BRCA2-deficient cells. Our study thus defines a new genetic subpopulation of cancers
susceptible towards TRAIL-R-targeting compounds, which could facilitate novel
therapeutic approaches for patients with BRCA2-deficient tumors.

INTRODUCTION

which is regulated by the immune-mediated clearance of
malignant and metastatic cells during the development of
tumors. This function is supported by studies showing a
correlation between loss of TRAIL-R-expression, poor
prognosis and tumor recurrence [30–33] and by in vivo
studies showing that TRAIL knockout (KO) mice exhibit
enhanced primary tumor and metastasis formation [34].
Thus, TRAIL represents a promising novel anti-cancer
therapy. Many types of recombinant TRAIL or agonistic
antibodies targeting TRAIL-R have been made available
for clinical use [29] and are currently tested in clinical
trials. However, none of the previously conducted trials
with TRAIL-R-targeting compounds reached their
endpoint of improving patients’ outcomes (reviewed
in [35]). One possible explanation for the failure of such
agents to reproduce the effects achieved in preclinical
experiments could be represented by the heterogeneity
of the distribution of cell surface-bound cell receptors,
as we previously suggested [31–33]. This idea seems
to be supported by a very recent clinical trial showing
that TRAIL-R2 imaging with radioactively labelled
tigatuzumab (CS-1008) is predictive of clinical benefit in
the treatment of patients affected by metastatic colorectal
cancer [35]. In addition, the existence of intracellular
mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL are likely limiting the
clinical efficacy of these agents [36].
BRCA2-mutations are known to confer
chemosensitivity to ICL-agents. Although this effect
is known to be mediated by cell cycle jamming in
consequence of impaired DNA repair, apoptosis is
eventually triggered in these cells. In the present paper we
assessed the possibility that BRCA2-deficient cells could
thus display enhanced sensitivity towards the action of
TRAIL in order to define a subpopulation of tumors highly
susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis which would
be highly likely to respond to the clinical application of
TRAIL-R targeting compounds. This hypothesis was
tested first in vitro applying a BRCA2 gene knockout (KO)
model of the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 [37] and
a BRCA2 gene complementation model of the BRCA2mutant pancreatic cancer cell line CAPAN1 [38]. The
in vitro results were consecutively validated in vivo using
LBY in a murine xenograft model of BRCA2-deficient
cancer cells. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of
the observed hypersensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cancer
cells towards apoptosis-inducing agents were explored.

The DNA repair system represents a central
mechanism of cellular homeostasis facilitating the detection
and consequent repair of exogenous and endogenous DNA
damage, thus preventing the perpetuation of potentially
detrimental mutations and cancer formation. It consists
of multiple DNA repair mechanisms which, depending
on the recognized DNA damage pattern and cell cycle
phase, activate different DNA repair pathways [1, 2]. Upon
recognition of DNA damage, a complex system of events is
triggered to restore genetic integrity. However, when DNA
damage accumulates beyond the capability of the DNA
repair system, apoptosis is triggered [3].
The Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway represents the
central DNA repair pathway for homologous recombination
and is activated in response to stalled replication forks
during the S-phase of the cell cycle [4]. Inactivation of this
pathway occurs in patients suffering from the rare recessive
disorder FA and is caused by bi-allelic germline mutations
in one of at least 15 FA genes [5]. In addition, FA pathwayinactivation occurs at low frequency in various cancer
entities among the general (non-FA) population, indicating
a selective advantage during carcinogenesis, either through
an early malignant transformation-promoting step due
to an increased mutation rate or through an increased
cellular tolerance towards abnormal DNA replication [6].
For example, proximal FA pathway inactivation due to
rare mutations in FANCC or FANCG has been reported
in pancreatic cancer [7, 8] and epigenetic inactivation of
FANCF was found in a large variety of different tumors,
including bladder cancer [9], breast cancer [10], cervical
cancer [11], head and neck cancer [12], lung cancer
[12] and ovarian cancer [13]. Even more prominently,
inactivation of the distal FA pathway through mutations
in the BRCA2 (FANCD1) gene has been reported in breast
cancer [14] (familial cases [15–17]), pancreatic cancer
[18, 19] and ovarian cancer [20], among others. Due to the
well-established hypersensitivity of FA pathway-deficient
tumor cells towards DNA-damaging ICL-agents, FA gene
defects define patient subpopulations for individualized
genotype-based therapies [21–23]. However, due to the side
effects of these agents, there is a need to identify additional
agents eliciting FA hypersensitivity, which could then be
applied either alone or in combination with ICL-agents
[23]. This concept was recently substantiated by reports of
strong clinically responses of FA pathway-deficient cancers
towards ICL-agents and PARP-inhibitors [24–28].
The two functional receptors for TRAIL,
TRAIL-receptor-1 (TRAIL-R1) and TRAIL-receptor-2
(TRAIL-R2), are expressed in most human tissues
and tumors and possess the particular ability to trigger
apoptosis in cancer cells but not in non-malignant cells
[29]. This tumor-selective pro-apoptotic effect of TRAIL-R
stimulation is thought to reflect the physiological role
played by the TRAIL-system during tumor-surveillance,

RESULTS
Genetic inactivation of BRCA2 enhances the
susceptibility of cancer cells towards TRAILR-mediated apoptosis
To assess the effects of BRCA2 status on the
sensitivity towards TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis,
proliferation assays were performed upon administration

of recombinant human TRAIL in parental BRCA2
wild type DLD1 colon cancer cells (termed DLD1),
heterozygote BRCA2+/− KO cells (clone termed A9A2)
and homozygous BRCA2−/− KO cells (two independently
established clones termed A10-1 and A10-3, respectively).
As a control, the cells were treated with the ICL-agent
MMC, for which the specific hypersensitivity of BRCA2deficient cells is well-established.
Upon treatment with MMC, we expectedly
observed a strongly reduced proliferation rate in the two
BRCA2−/−cell clones A10-1 and A10-3 as compared to the
parental BRCA2+/+ and heterozygote BRCA2+/− A9A2 cells
(IC50 ratio approx. 10). A similar pattern was observed
upon administration of TRAIL, which also caused a
dose-dependent proliferation decrease in both BRCA2−/−
clones as compared to control cells (IC50 ratio approx. 5)
(Figure 1A). Similar results were achieved after treatment
with the FAS-agonistic antibody anti-Apo-1, which
shows that the effects of BRCA2-status are not limited
to TRAIL-R stimulation, but affect mechanisms of the
activation of apoptosis common to other receptors of the
extrinsic signaling pathway (Figure S1).

DLD1 as well as the BRCA2-complementation CAPAN1
models using LBY135 [40] and tigatuzumab [41],
two TRAIL-R2-targeting antibodies which have been
recently made available for clinical application. These
experiments clearly confirmed the enhanced susceptibility
of BRCA2-deficient cells towards TRAIL-R-stimulation
(Figure 1C and 1D). Of note, BRCA2−/− cell clones
displayed a 35-fold increased sensitivity towards LBY135,
an effect significantly exceeding the well-established
effects of all common DNA-ICL agents [21, 37]. This
agent was thus expected to exert particularly strong effects
in the experimental in vivo setting. Consequently, LBY135
was used for subsequent experiments.

siRNA-mediated BRCA2 knockdown enhances
the sensitivity of cancer cells towards TRAILR-mediated apoptosis
To rule out clonal artefacts potentially occurring
in gene KO and gene complementation models, RNAinterference experiments using BRCA2-siRNA were
conducted in DLD1 cells. At 72 h after transfection with
BRCA2-siRNA at 25 or 50 nM, respectively, LBY135
treatment resulted in a small but significant decrease of
cell viability as compared to control-transfected cells
(IC50 ratio approx. 3 fold) (Figure 2). The quantitatively
smaller effects observed in the BRCA2 siRNA model as
compared to the BRCA2 KO model are likely attributable
to the incomplete protein depletion upon siRNA, an effect
previously observed by us [22, 23].

Susceptibility towards TRAIL-R-mediated
apoptosis is decreased by re-expression of
BRCA2 in BRCA2-deficient cancer cells
To rule out cell line- or method-dependent
phenomena, the data obtained in DLD1 cells were
confirmed in a BRCA2-complementation model
established by Wang et al. [38], employing the pancreatic
cancer cell line CAPAN1. This cell line harbors the
naturally occurring, inactivating BRCA2 6174delT
frameshift mutation accompanied by loss of the second
allele, the severe impact of which on BRCA2 function has
previously been extensively characterized [39]. In our
experiments, parental CAPAN1 cells (termed CAPAN1)
and empty-vector transfected cells (termed CAPAN1/
NEO) were compared with two independently established
CAPAN1 cell clones complemented by stably transfected
BRCA2 (termed BRCA2/236 and BRCA2/CIN). In these
cells, re-expression of BRCA2 decreased the sensitivity
towards MMC as well as towards TRAIL (Figure 1B).
However, the changes towards MMC were less obvious
than those observed in the DLD1 model (IC50 ratio
approx. 2), which might be attributable to the different
experimental approaches (stable BRCA2 overexpression
in the BRCA2-deficient CAPAN1 line versus complete
BRCA2 KO in the BRCA2-proficient DLD1 line), a
phenomenon previously observed in other studies [22, 23].

TRAIL-R stimulation causes early onset of
apoptosis without preceding cell cycle arrest in
BRCA2−/− cells
To analyze the mechanistic basis of the increased
susceptibility of BRCA2-deficient cancer cells towards
TRAIL-R-targeting agents, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
were determined upon treatment with LBY135 and the
results compared to those observed upon treatment with
MMC. First, cell cycle profiles were assessed by FACS
analysis after administration of MMC or LBY135 in
BRCA2-deficient vs. BRCA2-proficient cells. Then,
apoptosis rates were assessed by measuring sub-G1
events, which correspond to the fraction of cells showing
nuclear fragmentation in consequence of apoptotic death.
Hypersensitivity of FA pathway-deficient cells towards
ICL-agents is known to be associated with a late S-phase/
G2/M arrest [7, 21]. Accordingly, MMC treatment of
BRCA2−/− cells expectedly led to a dose- and timedependent early increase of the cell fraction in G2/M at 24
and 48 h as compared to control DLD1 cells (Figure 3A,
left panels). G2/M-arrest was followed by apoptosis at 48
h, which progressively increased and peaked at 72 h after
treatment (Figure 3A, right panel). In contrast, LBY135
caused apoptosis as early as 24 h after treatment without

compounds observed in vitro was transferable to the
in vivo setting, we applied a murine tumor xenograft
model. Tumors from parental DLD1 or corresponding
BRCA2−/− cells were induced in nude mice by
subcutaneous injection. Animals exhibiting a solid
palpable tumor mass at the injection site 5 days after tumor
inoculation were randomized to receive intraperitoneally
thrice a week LBY135 at 5 mg/kg or vehicle over a time
period of 21 days (parental DLD1 cells: control group:
N = 10, LBY135-treated group: N = 9. BRCA2−/− A10-3
cell clones: control group: N = 9; LBY135 group: N = 12).
Tumor growth rate was assessed by repeated tumor size
measurements of the lesions, using the initial tumor
lesion as denominator. LBY135 treatment caused a
strongly decreased tumor growth rate as compared to
vehicle-treated tumors specifically in tumors originating
from BRCA2−/− cells (LBY135-treated BRCA2−/− cells
on d21: 130 ± 22 mm3 vs. baseline 46 ± 7 mm3 [3.7 ±
1.1 fold increase]; control-treated BRCA2−/− cells on d21:
308 ± 34 mm3 vs. baseline 36 ± 3.4 [9 ± 1.3 fold increase]
– p < 0.001) (Figure 5A right panel), whereas no significant
differences were observed in tumors from parental cells
(LBY135-treated BRCA2+/+ cells on d21: 719 ± 146 mm3 vs.
baseline 88 ± 9 mm3 [8.7 ± 1.8 fold increase]; control-treated
BRCA2+/+ cells on d21: 663 ± 113 mm3 vs. baseline 75 ± 7
[8.8 ± 1.4 fold increase] – p = 0.70) (Figure 5A left panel).

DNA fragmentation and caspase cleavage
confirms increased apoptosis in BRCA2−/− cells
Apoptosis was validated by demonstration of
massive DNA fragmentation as a typical apoptosis feature
(Figure 4A) and increased cleavage of CASPASE3
(Figure 4B) in BRCA2−/− cells after treatment with
LBY135. Additionally, increased cleavage was also
observed for CASPASE8 in BRCA2−/− cells, suggesting
that increased apoptosis occurs as consequence of
the activation the death-inducing signaling complex
(DISC) upon TRAIL-R-stimulation. This pattern of
increased caspase cleavage was confirmed in the BRCA2complementation CAPAN1 model (Figure 4C).
Since TRAIL-R-stimulation could result in
necroptosis under certain circumstances [42], BRCA2−/−
and control DLD1 cells were additionally incubated with
LBY135 with or without the addition of necrostatin to block
necrosis induction. However, addition of necrostatin did not
affect cell morphology or apoptosis rates (data not shown).

TRAIL-R-induced apoptosis is not mediated
by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in
BRCA2-deficient cells

DISCUSSION

Since apoptosis triggered in response to DNA
damage is typically triggered by alteration of the balance
between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors that regulate
mitochondrial polarisation [43], we next analyzed the
baseline protein expression levels of principal mediators
of the mitochondrial signaling pathway. However, except
for a slight reduction of the expression of the pro-apoptotic
molecule PUMA, which was observable only in the
BRCA2−/− A10-3 but not the BRCA2−/− A10-1 clone (thus
likely reflecting a clonal phenomenon), no significant
changes in any of the tested regulators of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway were detected in BRCA2-proficient
or -deficient cells, regarding both baseline expression
(Figure 4D) and expression upon TRAIL-R stimulation
(data not shown). Importantly, FACS analyses showed that
membrane staining of TRAIL-R1 and –R2 did not differ
in these cell lines (Figure 4E). These data suggest that the
increased susceptibility of BRCA2-deficient cells towards
TRAIL-R-targeting compounds specifically potentiates
TRAIL-R-signaling and caspase 8 recruitment rather than
enhancing downstream mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.

Aiming at expanding the therapeutic exploitation
of BRCA2-deficiency for cancer therapy, we investigated
here whether deleterious BRCA2 mutations might
confer increased susceptibility towards TRAIL-Rtargeting agents. Such compounds, which are known to
induce apoptosis selectively in cancer cells, have been
recently developed and are currently undergoing clinical
investigation in multiple tumor entities [29, 44].
In agreement with previous studies [37], treatment of
BRCA2-deficient cells with MMC caused early cell cycle
arrest at 24 h after treatment, which was subsequently
followed by apoptosis reaching a peak at 72 h. In contrast,
apoptosis upon TRAIL-R stimulation was induced without
preceding or concomitant cell cycle arrest already at
24 h, as demonstrated by caspase cleavage and early
appearance of cellular apoptotic features. These data
show that the increased susceptibility of BRCA2-deficient
cancer cells towards TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis occurs
independently of a prior cell cycle arrest and can thus
mechanistically be distinguished from the well-established
effects of ICL-agents [37]. Of note, BRCA2-deficient cancer
cells displayed a significantly stronger hypersensitivity
towards TRAIL-R stimulation using LBY135 than towards
the classical ICL-agent MMC in our studies.
Using a murine xenograft model, we were able
to confirm these BRCA2 genotype-dependent effects of
TRAIL-R stimulation in vivo: tumor growth in mice was

significantly delayed upon intraperitoneal administration
of LBY135 specifically in BRCA2−/− cells, while no
significant differences in tumor growth kinetics were
observed in parental DLD1 cells. Our in vitro- and in vivodata thus clearly demonstrate a hypersensitivity phenotype
of BRCA2-deficient cells towards TRAIL-R-stimulation,
resembling and exceeding the effects of ICL-agents,
and could serve as a platform for clinical trials applying
TRAIL-R-agonistic antibodies specifically in patients with
BRCA2-mutant cancers.

To assess the distinct mechanisms of apoptosis
induction by MMC or TRAIL-R stimulation, respectively
(i.e. delayed apoptosis as a consequence of DNA-damage
and cell cycle arrest vs. direct apoptosis) we examined
the two main mechanisms of apoptosis induction, namely
the extrinsic (or receptor-mediated) and the intrinsic
(or mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. The extrinsic pathway
is triggered in cancer cells by the stimulation of apoptotic
membrane receptors like FAS and TRAIL-R [3] which lead
to CASPASE8 activation and, in turn CASPASE3 cleavage.

In contrast, the intrinsic pathway is initiated by
cell-internal stimuli including DNA repair errors, which
can occur either spontaneously or upon administration
of DNA-damaging agents [43]. This leads to a shift in
the pro-/anti-apoptotic balance towards pro-apoptotic
molecules (e.g. BAX, PUMA or NOXA), which
permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane, or to the
repression of anti-apoptotic molecules (e.g. BCL-2
and BCL-XL) which, conversely, lead to mitochondrial
stabilization [36]. Characteristically, accumulation of
unrepaired DNA damage can cause a cell cycle arrest
in the G2/M phase and subsequent apoptosis. This is
exemplified in our experiments by the observed early
G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis in BRCA2-deficient
cells upon MMC treatment. Similarly, a previous study
has shown an increase in the BAX to BCL-2 ratio and
elevated cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in
doxorubicin-treated BRCA2-knockout mice [45]. Due to
this role of the mitochondrial pathway in determining
apoptosis in BRCA2-deficient cells, we hypothesized that
the increased sensitivity of these cells towards TRAIL-R
targeting agents could be due to the increased recruitment
of the mitochondrial signalling pathway upon CASPASE8
cleavage. However, neither baseline- nor TRAIL-R
stimulation-induced expression levels of principal
regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (including
BAX, BIM, BID, BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, NOXA,
PUMA) differed between BRCA2-proficient and BRCA2deficient cells. The prompt increase of CASPASE8
cleavage upon stimulation of TRAIL-R-mediated
apoptosis specifically in BRCA2-deficient cells, which
do not differ in the baseline expression of membranebound TRAIL-receptors from their BRCA2-proficient
counterparts, along with the lack of typical changes in
the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway suggests that this
hypersensitivity phenotype is mediated at the level of
the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex
(DISC) and CASPASE8 recruitment. Interestingly, as
opposed to our results in BRCA2-deficient cells, a previous
study showed that MMC sensitizes cancer cells to the
pro-apoptotic effects of TRAIL by downregulating the
antiapoptotic proteins BCL2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL while
upregulating several pro-apoptotic proteins including
BAX and BIM. In addition, MMC induced an increase
of cell surface trafficking of both TRAIL receptors in
this study [46]. Taken together, these data indicate that
BRCA2 exerts antiapoptotic functions, which appear to be
independent from its previously described role within the
DNA repair system or mitochondrial pathway activation
and suggest a role for BRCA2 as a regulator of DISC.
Interestingly, preliminary data on isogenic RKO
cancer cells harbouring defects in the proximal FA
pathway revealed increased TRAIL-sensitivity only
upon FANCG inactivation, while FANCC deficient cells
remained unaffected (our own unpublished results).
These distinct and gene-specific functions of individual
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proximal FA genes [47] have previously been observed by
us in regard to ionizing radiation [21] and clearly warrant
further exploration.
Our study has also certain limitations. Despite
providing mechanistic insights, particularly by confining
the influence of BRCA2 on apoptosis to the level of
CASPASE8 recruitment or cleavage, the present work
does not clarify in-depth how exactly BRCA2 mediates the
sensitivity towards TRAIL-R stimulation. Specifically, the
mechanisms that lead to increased CASPASE8 recruitment
need to be further elucidated, including the involvement
of the caspase-antagonist FLIP [48], the mechanisms
controlling TRAIL-R clustering (e.g. O-glycosylation)
[49] or the roles of certain kinases such as PKC, as
recently suggested [50]. Furthermore, future proofof-principle ex-vivo experiments using primary tumor
samples could help to further strengthen the translational
relevance of our findings as a precondition prior to their
clinical application.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that BRCA2deficiency - modeled by two independent experimental
techniques - confers increased sensitivity towards TRAILR-stimulation in cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo.
These effects are mechanistically characterized through
early onset of apoptosis without concomitant cell cycle
arrest and appear not be related to the well-known
functions of BRCA2 during DNA-repair. Importantly,
while FA pathway- and particularly BRCA2-dependent
hypersensitivities have previously been convincingly
shown to be highly specific, reliably reproducible
in different model systems and restricted mainly to
ICL-agents [21, 37] and PARP inhibitors [51, 52], our
data now expand the therapeutically exploitable spectrum
to also include TRAIL R-targeting agents, providing a
pre-clinical basis for clinical trials of newly developed
TRAIL-R-agonistic antibodies in genetically defined
subsets of patients with BRCA2-deficient tumors. On
the one hand, patients developing resistance towards
ICL-agents could benefit from a second-line treatment
with TRAIL-R targeting compounds. On the other hand,
the combination of TRAIL-R targeting compounds with
ICL-agents is expected to either enhance the effects of
ICL-agents or facilitate a dose-reduction, thus mitigating
their side effects [23, 53]. Therefore, future pre-clinical
studies will need to assess whether ICL-agents and
TRAIL R-targeting drugs used in combination will cause
synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects in BRCA2deficient tumors [53]. Finally, recent studies in pancreatic
and other cancer tissue samples indicate that the
sub-cellular localization of TRAIL receptors influences
the cellular sensitivity towards TRAIL [31–33]. As the
recent clinical investigation of radio-labelled tigatuzumab
demonstrates [35], these drug combinations might be
thus particularly effective in those subsets of patients
with BRCA2-deficient tumors that display an uptake for
TRAIL-R-targeting antibodies.

at 140 V and then transferred onto PVDF membranes.
After blocking for 1 h in TBST (tris-buffered saline with
Tween-20) containing 5% milk or 1% milk and 1% bovine
serum albumin, membranes were incubated overnight with
the following primary antibodies: CASPASE3 (#9662),
CASPASE8 (#9508), CASPASE 9 (#9508) and BCL-XL
(#2764), purchased from Cell Signaling/New England
Biolabs GmbH (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), β-ACTIN
(#A5441) from Sigma Aldrich (Munich, Germany), Bcl-2
(#610539) and BCL-XL (#610746) from BD Biosciences
(Heidelberg, Germany), MCL-1 (#sc-12756), BAD (#sc8044), BAK (#sc-7873), PUMA (#sc-374223), and NOXA
(#sc-30209) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg,
Germany), BAX (#ab7977) from Abcam (Cambridge,
UK), BIM (#559685) from BD Pharmingen (Heidelberg,
Germany), XIAP (#IMG-5770) from Novus Biologicals LLC
(Littleton, USA). Corresponding secondary antibodies were
used at concentrations of 1:10.000. Detection was performed
using the Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific #34077 – Schwerte, Germany).
BRCA2 immunoblotting was performed using anti-BRCA2
antibody (#OP95, Merck Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany)
and ORC-2 (rabbit anti-ORC-2, #559266, purchased by BD
Pharmingen) as a loading control [55].

LBY135 was kindly provided by Novartis
(Nuernberg, Germany), tigatuzumab (CS-1008) by
Daiichi-Sankyo Pharma Development (Edison NJ, USA).
Protein A was added at 0.01 times the concentration of
LBY135 or tigatuzumab to facilitate antibody crosslinking.
Recombinant human TRAIL/TNFSF10, was purchased
from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, USA), Anti-Apo 1–3
from Alexis/ENZO Life Sciences (Lörrach, Germany).
Parental DLD1 cells along with the corresponding
heterozygote BRCA2+/− (termed A9A2) and homozygote
BRCA2−/− (termed A10-1, A10-3) were kindly provided
by Thomas Hucl and originally developed by him and
Eike Gallmeier in Scott Kern’s laboratory (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore/MD, USA) [37]. CAPAN1 cells along
with the corresponding empty vector-transfected CAPAN1/
NEO and two BRCA2-complemented CAPAN1/236 and
CAPAN1/CIN cell clones were kindly provided by MienChie Hung in July 2010 (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, Texas) [38]. BRCA2 gene knockout was tested
and confirmed in DLD1 cells on the genetic level by direct
sequencing directly upon arrival, on the protein level by
western blotting and on the functional level by assessment
of sensitivity towards MMC and RAD51 focus formation.
Likewise, BRCA2 gene complementation of CAPAN1 cells
was confirmed on the genetic level by direct sequencing, on
the protein level by western blotting and on the functional
level by assessment of RAD51 focus formation. Extensive
screening efforts earlier conducted by us and others have
previously illustrated the specific hypersensitivity of
BRCA2, FANCG- and/or FANCC-deficient cells towards
ICL-agents [21, 37] and PARP inhibitors [51, 52] and
demonstrated that these gene defects did not have any
effects towards most other therapeutic agents, including
gemcitabine [7, 37, 54], which was therefore used among
several other agents as negative control in our experiments
(data not shown). All cell lines were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine and
penicillin/streptomycin (PAA, Cölbe, Germany).

FACS analysis of surface receptors
DLD1 and A10-1 BRCA2−/− cell clones were
detached from the plates by 1% Trypsin-EDTA, washed
and incubated for 30 min. with the following monoclonal
FITC-coupled antibodies: TRAIL-R1 (ALX-804297F-T100), TRAIL-R2 (ALX-804-298F-T100) from
Enzo Life Science (Loerach, Germany) and control IgG1
(BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany).

Apoptosis and cell cycle assays
For cell cycle and apoptosis analyses, 8.0 × 104–
1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and, after
overnight incubation, treated with the indicated agents.
After propidium iodide staining, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS – Accuri C6 flow cytometer, BD
Biosciences San Jose, CA USA) was performed as
previously described [9]. Apoptosis was quantified by the
fraction of cells with sub-diploid DNA content (Sub-G1)
and confirmed morphologically by Hoechst 33342 staining
and fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Cell proliferation assays
1,000–1,500 cells were plated in 96-well plates,
allowed to adhere and then treated with the indicated
agents at the indicated concentrations. After 6 days, cells
underwent osmotic lysis in 100 µl H2O. After addition of
0.5% Picogreen (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany), fluorescence was measured (Cytofluor Series
4000, Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and
the proliferation index calculated, defining the untreated
samples as 1. Three independent experiments were
performed per agent, with each data point reflecting
triplicate wells. Error bars represent standard error of the
mean (SEM) from three experiments.

siRNA-mediated BRCA2 knockdown
Parental DLD1 cells were allowed to reach 30%–50%
conﬂuence and then incubated with oligofectamine
(Invitrogen) and siRNA directed against BRCA2
9487

Oncotarget

(Hs BRCA2 7, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or with
oligofectamine alone, which served as control. siRNA
were used at ﬁnal concentrations of 25 nM and 50 nM,
respectively. 72 h after transfection, the cells were used for
proliferation assays and immunoblotting.

For xenograft tumor induction, 8 week old nu/nu
nude mice were injected in both flanks with either 106
isolated DLD1 parental cells or with the corresponding
BRCA2−/− KO cells (A10-3 clone). Each group consisted
of 12 animals. After 5 days, animals displaying tumor
engraftment, i.e. solid palpable lesions at either one or
both of the injection sites, were randomized to receive a
solution of LBY135 at 5 mg/kg or vehicle intraperitoneally
thrice a week. Tumor growth was monitored daily over
a time period of 21 days through repeated assessment of
tumor volume, determined through measurement of the
two major tumor diameters with a caliper. These data were
expressed for each cell line as the ratio of the tumor size
to the initial tumor size (measured at day 5 after injection
of tumor cells). All animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines of the German law for animal
life protection and approved by the local ethics committee.
