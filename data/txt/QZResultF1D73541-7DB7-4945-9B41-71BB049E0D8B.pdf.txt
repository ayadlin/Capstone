ABSTRACT
The invasion-promoting MT1-MMP is a cell surface-associated collagenase with
a plethora of critical cellular functions. There is a consensus that MT1-MMP is a key
protease in aberrant pericellular proteolysis in migrating cancer cells and, accordingly,
a promising drug target. Because of high homology in the MMP family and a limited
success in the design of selective small-molecule inhibitors, it became evident that the
inhibitor specificity is required for selective and successful MT1-MMP therapies. Using
the human Fab antibody library (over 1.25×109 individual variants) that exhibited
the extended, 23-27 residue long, VH CDR-H3 segments, we isolated a panel of the
inhibitory antibody fragments, from which the 3A2 Fab outperformed others as a
specific and potent, low nanomolar range, inhibitor of MT1-MMP. Here, we report
the in-depth characterization of the 3A2 antibody. Our multiple in vitro and cellbased tests and assays, and extensive structural modeling of the antibody/protease
interactions suggest that the antibody epitope involves the residues proximal to the
protease catalytic site and that, in contrast with tissue inhibitor-2 of MMPs (TIMP-2),
the 3A2 Fab inactivates the protease functionality by binding to the catalytic domain
outside the active site cavity. In agreement with the studies in metastasis by others,
our animal studies in acute pulmonary melanoma metastasis support a key role of
MT1-MMP in metastatic process. Conversely, the selective anti-MT1-MMP monotherapy
significantly alleviated melanoma metastatic burden. It is likely that further affinity
maturation of the 3A2 Fab will result in the lead inhibitor and a proof-of-concept for
MT1-MMP targeting in metastatic cancers.

(CAT), a flexible hinge linker and a hemopexin domain
[7]. In addition, MT-MMPs also includes either a
transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic tail
domain (MT1-, MT2-, MT3- and MT5-MMP) or a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (MT4- and MT6MMP) that tethers these proteases to the cell membrane
[7]. MMPs are zinc-dependent proteinases and they share
the active site zinc binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH in
which the His residues coordinate the catalytic zinc ion
[8]. MMPs are synthesized as latent zymogens that require
proteolytic activation to become functional proteases.
In this process, the N-terminal inhibitory prodomain is
removed and the catalytic site of the emerging mature

Metastatic spread is frequently lethal to cancer
patients and the treatment options are frequently limited.
In multiple cancer types, the level of zinc-dependent
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is increased to allow
metastatic cells to degrade the extracellular matrix and to
invade the tissue and distant organs [1-5].
There are 23 individual MMPs in humans from
which 18 proteinases are soluble and 6 are membranetethered [membrane type (MT)-MMPs] [6]. Soluble
MMP proenzymes typically contain an N-terminal
inhibitory prodomain followed by a catalytic domain

enzyme becomes liberated and exposed. It is established
that pro-metastatic, collagenolytic membrane-tethered
MT1-MMP/MMP-14 functions as a main mediator of
the pro-migratory proteolytic events at the cell surface
[9, 10]. Expression of MT1-MMP directly correlates with
poor clinical outcome, blood vessel invasion and high
incidence of distant metastasis in multiple cancer types
[11-13]. MT1-MMP null mice are dwarfs with skeletal
abnormalities and soft tissue disorders, and they die prior
to adulthood, thus supporting the crucial function of MT1MMP in cell migration during gastrulation and collagen
turnover [14]. Overall, there is a consensus among
researchers that because of its importance in promoting
cell invasion and metastasis MT1-MMP is a promising
drug target in cancer and certain other pathologies [11-13,
15-19].
MT1-MMP is regulated both as a protease and as a
membrane-anchored protein. Similar with other MMPs,
the proteolytic removal of the inhibitory prodomain
is required for the conversion of the latent, 63 kDa,
MT1-MMP zymogen into the functionally active, 55
kDa, protease. The furin-like proprotein convertase
activity is essential to the prodomain removal and
MT1-MMP activation [20-22]. Once activated, MT1MMP can be efficiently inhibited by its natural protein
inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) [23].
The binding of TIMPs to the MT1-MMP active enzyme
results in the stoichiometric and proteolytically inactive
TIMP•MT1-MMP complex. There are four individual
TIMPs in humans (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4) [23, 24].
With the exception of TIMP-1, TIMPs are efficient, subnanomolar inhibitors of MT1-MMP [25, 26]. The MT1MMP/TIMP balance is arguably the most significant
factor in the regulation of the net proteolytic activity of
cellular MT1-MMP. As a membrane-tethered protease,
MT1-MMP is also regulated via cellular compartment
trafficking, internalization and recycling [4, 27, 28]. These
coordinated, multi-dimensional mechanisms regulate
MT1-MMP spatially and temporally, and they concentrate
the MT1-MMP activity on the leading and trailing edges
in migrating cells [10].
Through earlier trial and error, it became evident
that the inhibitor specificity is required for selective and
successful MMP therapies [29-33]. Accomplishing the
required target specificity and selectivity with smallmolecule MMP inhibitors is exceedingly difficult
and so far the success has been limited. Because the
catalytic mechanism and the catalytic domain fold are
largely conserved in the MMP family members, the
small-molecule inhibitors simultaneously interact with
multiple MMPs resulting in off-target effects and low
therapeutic efficacy [31-33]. As a viable alternative and
because of their potentially supreme selectivity, a few
human recombinant inhibitory antibodies are emerging
as both research tools and promising therapeutic agents
[34-36]. Among the currently developed anti-MT1www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MMP antibodies [17, 34, 37-41], the human recombinant
monoclonal DX2400 IgG is the most potent and selective
inhibitory antibody raised against human MT1-MMP
(Ki = 0.6 nM) [36].
We hypothesized that the antibodies that efficiently
inhibit MT1-MMP should resemble TIMP-2 (the
natural, most potent MT1-MMP inhibitor). TIMP-2
exhibits a long, convex-shaped loop that inserts into the
protease active site and blocks the catalytic function
[42, 43]. Accordingly, we suggested that the paratope/
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a MT1MMP-inhibitory antibody should be flexible and long
enough to access the active site cavity. We then customdesigned synthetic human Fab libraries carrying a 2327 residue long and flexible heavy chain (VH) CDR-H3
paratope that was inserted into the human antibody
framework. Here, we characterize a novel, selective and
potent, human recombinant 3A2 MT1-MMP antibody
identified in our hybrid Fab antibody library [43]. The
unique methodology we used in designing and selecting
this inhibitory antibody is described in our accompanying
manuscript (submitted). Our results support and extent
the investigations by others. Our current observations
demonstrate the importance of MT1-MMP in promoting
the metastatic process. Conversely, the selective anti-MT1MMP monotherapy is likely to alleviate the melanoma
metastatic burden and, ultimately, to perform similarly
in certain other metastatic cancers with the enhanced
expression and activity of MT1-MMP.

RESULTS
The 3A2 Fab is an efficient inhibitor of MT1MMP
We synthesized the human Fab antibody library
(over 1.25×109 individual variants) that exhibited the
extended, 23-27 residue long, VH CDR-H3 segments
(submitted). These Fab constructs were expressed in E.
coli, purified from the E. coli cell lysates and the purified
samples (purity >95%) were then used in our studies. We
next identified over twenty binders from which fourteen
performed as potent inhibitors of MT1-MMP. In our
current study, four of the most efficient Fab antibody
binders of MT1-MMP were then selected for the in-depth
analysis and characterization (Figure 1A).
Using the Fab ELISA tests with the individual
catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (MT1-CAT) as bait
for the increasing concentrations of the Fab fragments,
we confirmed that the 3A2 (VH CDR-H3 sequence
VKLQKDKSHQWIRNLVATPYGRYVMDY), 2B5 (VH
CDR-H3 sequence IGVNAWAVKMSQRMLATRGSGWY
VMDY) and 3E9 (VH CDR-H3 sequence NGRY

PWNGRWVKLYGMDY) was far less efficient in our
ELISA binding tests. The Kd value of the 3A2 Fab (8 nM)
was comparable with that of the DX2400 Fab (2 nM; VH
CDR-H3 sequence GRAFDI), which is currently the most
potent inhibitory antibody developed against human MT1MMP [35, 36] (Figure 1B). Our additional cleavage tests
using the Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 peptide as a cleavage
substrate and the increasing concentrations of the Fab
fragments as inhibitors revealed that both the 2B5 and
3A2 Fab antibodies performed as efficient, low nanomolar
range, antagonists of MT1-MMP. Thus, the IC50 value of
the 3A2 Fab was 18 nM, suggesting that this Fab sequence

is only 2-fold less efficient against MT1-MMP compared
with the DX2400 Fab (8.5 nM). In turn, neither the 3B10
nor 3E9 Fab fragments inhibited MT1-MMP activity (IC50
> 5,000 nM for both) indicating that the binding efficacy
does not always directly correlate with the inhibitory
potency (Figure 1C).

The 3A2 Fab performs as a selective inhibitor of
MT1-MMP
To test if the 3A2 antibody performs not only as
an efficient but also as a selective inhibitor, we evaluated

its off-target interactions against a panel of the purified
MMPs. Because earlier we have already proved that the
3A2 antibody did not cross-react with the soluble MMP2 and MMP-9 (submitted), here we evaluated the more
closely related enzymes from the MT-MMP sub-family,
including MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5MMP and MT6-MMP. For these purposes, the increasing
concentrations of the 3A2 Fab were used to inhibit the
cleavage activity of these five MT-MMPs against the
Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 substrate. Our results clearly
indicated that the 3A2 Fab was highly specific against
MT1-MMP (IC50 = 18 nM). The 3A2 Fab was incapable
of inhibiting MT4-MMP and MT6-MMP (IC50 > 5,000 nM
for both), the proteases that are less related to MT1-MMP.
An insignificant inhibitory efficacy of the 3A2 Fab was
observed against MT2-MMP (IC50 ≈ 1,800 nM), MT3MMP (IC50 ≈ 335 nM) and MT5-MMP (IC50 ≈ 425 nM)
(Figure 1D).

proMMP-2 activation pathway, MT1-MMP cleaves the
Asn37-Leu38 scissile bond in the proMMP-2 prodomain
sequence. This cleavage transforms the MMP-2 zymogen
into the 64 kDa activation intermediate. The latter then
autolytically generates the 62 kDa mature enzyme
[49, 50]. To elucidate if the 3A2 antibody inhibits the
functional activity of cellular MT1-MMP, we co-incubated
human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells that express naturally
MT1-MMP with the 3A2 Fab for 16-18 h. For comparison,
HT1080 cells were also co-incubated with TIMP-1, TIMP2 or either the DX2400 Fab or IgG. The non-inhibitory
MT1-MMP 3G4 antibody was used as an irrelevant
antibody control. GM6001 hydroxamate was used as an
additional control. To increase the MT1-MMP cellular
activity, HT1080 cells were stimulated with phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate. Conditioned medium aliquots
were then analyzed by gelatin zymography. As expected,
primarily the 68 kDa proMMP-2 zymogen was revealed
in the intact HT1080 cells, while the significant levels
of the 64 kDa activation intermediate and the 62 kDa
mature enzyme of MMP-2 were present in the stimulated
HT1080 cells (Figure 2A). Both GM6001 (1,000 nM)
and TIMP-2 (100 nM) blocked the proMMP-2 activation
in the stimulated HT1080 cells, while TIMP-1 (a poor
inhibitor of MT1-MMP) and a non-inhibitory MT1-MMP
3G4 antibody were both ineffective (1,000 nM, each).
Our quantification of the zymogen:activation intermediate
ratio in the MMP-2 samples demonstrated a comparable
inhibitory efficacy of the 3A2 and DX2400 Fab fragments
(Figure 2A).
To corroborate these data and demonstrate that
the inhibition of MMP-2 activation was caused by the
inactivation of cellular MT1-MMP rather than by the
antibody cytotoxicity, we determined if the MT1-MMP
antibodies affected cell viability. For these purposes,
we used normal mammary epithelial 184B5 cells which
are more fragile compared with the apoptosis-resistant
cancer cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h with a high,
1 µM, concentration of the antibodies. Viable cells were
then assessed using an ATP-Lite assay. Our data clearly
demonstrated that none of the inhibitory antibodies had an
effect on cell viability (Figure 2B).

Inhibition of MT1-MMP proteolysis of α1antitrypsin serpin by the 3A2 Fab
Because the 3A2 Fab outperformed other Fab
constructs, our further studies were focused on the 3A2
antibody alone. The 3A2 Fab was efficient not only in
suppressing the peptide cleavage by MT1-MMP but also
MT1-MMP proteolysis of the protein substrates. Thus,
human α1-antitrypsin (AAT) serpin is a clinically relevant
protein target of MMP proteolysis as well as a common
and convenient substrate for testing the functional
activity of MMPs in vitro. MMPs normally cleave the
56 kDa AAT near the C-terminus to generate the 52 kDa
N-terminal and the 4 kDa C-terminal fragments [44-48].
In agreement, at a 1:50 enzyme-substrate molar ratio,
MT1-CAT almost fully proteolyzed AAT in 1 h. Inhibition
of MT1-MMP proteolysis was already observable at the
low, 20 nM, concentration of the 3A2 antibody. A 200
nM 3A2 Fab concentration caused an almost quantitative
inhibition of MT1-MMP proteolysis of AAT. Similar
results were also observed with the DX2400 Fab (Figure
1E). As controls, we co-incubated AAT with TIMP-1
(an inefficient MT1-MMP inhibitor), TIMP-2 (a potent
MT1-MMP inhibitor) or the broad spectrum hydroxamate
MMP inhibitor GM6001 (IC50 = 0.4 nM against MT1MMP). As expected, both TIMP-2 (20 nM) and GM6001
(100 nM) readily abolished MT1-MMP proteolysis of
ATT, whereas TIMP-1 (1,000 nM) was without effect.
In sum, under our experimental conditions the 3A2 Fab
inhibitory potency was similar with that of both TIMP-2
and DX2400 Fab.

3A2 Fab inhibits collagenolysis mediated by
cellular MT1-MMP
Because MT1-MMP is a collagenase, we next
tested if the 3A2 Fab was capable of inhibiting the
collagenolytic activity of cellular MT1-MMP. For these
purposes, we performed a type-I collagen (COL-I)
degradation assay using 184B5-MT1 cells and assessed
the 3A2 inhibitory potency in comparison with that of
GM6001, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and both DX2400 Fab and
IgG. As an additional control, we used 184B5-mock
cells, which do not express MT1-MMP and, as a result,
do not proteolyze COL-I. Cells were plated for 5 days

cells were negative. Both GM6001 (1,000 nM) and
TIMP-2 (100 nM) blocked COL-I degradation in 184B5-

MT1 cells, while TIMP-1 (1,000 nM) was inactive
suggesting that MT1-MMP rather than other MMPs was
a key in COL-I cleavage in our cell system. Consistently,
the 3A2 Fab (200 nM) and both the DX2400 Fab (200
nM) and IgG (100 nM) quantitatively inhibited MT1-

activation, cells were stimulated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml). Cells were then co-incubated with the 3A2 and
DX2400 antibodies (20-200 nM, each) and also with the non-inhibitory MT1-MMP 3G4 IgG antibody (20-200 nM), TIMP-1 (1,000 nM),
TIMP-2 (100 nM) and GM6001 (1,000 nM) controls. Medium aliquots were next analyzed by gelatin zymography to identify the status
of MMP-2. Cells alone, no inhibitors were added to the cells. Bottom, the digitized zymogen:activation intermediate ratio in the MMP2 samples. White and grey rectangles, zymogen and activation intermediate, respectively. The numbers indicate the percentage of the

experiments performed in triplicate. C. The 3A2 Fab antibody inhibits COL-I degradation by cellular MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP-deficient
184B5-mock and MT1-MMP-overexpressing 184B5-MT1 cells were plated onto COL-I layers and then incubated alone or co-incubated
for 5 days with the 3A2 Fab (200 nM), DX2400 Fab or IgG (200 nM and 100 nM, respectively), TIMP-1 (1,000 nM), TIMP-2 (100 nM)
or GM6001 (1,000 nM). After the removal of cells, COL-I was stained with Coomassie. The representative images from three independent
experiments performed in triplicate are shown. D. Cell invasion through COL-I. 184B5-mock (mock) and 184B5-MT1 (MT1) cells (1×105,

concentrations DX2400 IgG. GM6001 (1,000 nM) and 10% FBS were used as a control and a chemoattractant, respectively. Migration
efficiency was calculated relative to MT1 cells, no inhibitor and 10% FBS (=100%). Data are means ± SE from three individual experiments

MMP-dependent collagenolysis in 184B5-MT1 cells
(Figure 2C).

To corroborate these results, we tested if the 3A2
antibody was capable of inhibiting COL-I degradation by
the cellular murine MT1-MMP. For these purposes, we
plated murine B16F1-mMT1 cells onto slides coated with
COL-I and then incubated the cells with or without the
3A2 Fab, the DX2400 Fab or IgG, TIMP-2 or GM6001.
In 5 days, cells were removed and the slides were fixed,
stained using Coomassie and observed using a microscope.
Intact B16F1-mMT1 cells readily degraded COL-I layer.
On a contrary, there was no significant degradation of
COL-I in cells co-incubated with GM6001 (1,000 nM),
TIMP-2 (100 nM) or the DX2400 antibody either in
Fab or IgG format (200 nM and 100 nM, respectively)
(Figure 3B). Overall, our data indicated that similar with
human MT1-MMP both the 3A2 and DX2400 antibodies
performed as potent inhibitors of the murine protease.

3A2 Fab inhibits MT1-MMP-dependent cell
invasion
Because cellular MT1-MMP plays a major role in
promoting cell invasion, we evaluated if the 3A2 antibody
was capable of affecting cell invasion through a layer
of COL-I. For these purposes, we performed a COL-I
invasion assay using Boyden migration chambers in which
porous membranes were coated with a thin layer of COL-I.
In the assay we used 184B5-MT1 cells and evaluated
the 3A2 Fab inhibitory potency in comparison with that
of both the DX2400 Fab and IgG antibodies. The cells
were plated in serum-free DMEM in the upper chamber.
DMEM-10% FBS was added to the lower chamber as
a chemoattractant. The inhibitors were added to both
chambers. The 184B5-mock cells that do not produce
MT1-MMP and, as a result, do not migrate efficiently
serve as a control [51, 52]. In turn, 184B5-MT1 cells
stably transfected with MT1-MMP acquired an ability to
migrate through COL-I (Figure 2D). GM6001 (1,000 nM)
blocked migration of 184B5-MT1 cells to a level observed
in MT1-MMP-deficient 184B5-mock cells. There was a
noticeable repression of migration efficiency of 184B5MT1 cells in the presence of the 3A2 and DX2400 Fab
fragments (500 nM each). The full-length DX2400 IgG,
however, exhibited in a dose-dependent manner a more
efficient inhibition suggesting that the Fab fragments
underperform in comparison with the respective fulllength antibody format.

3A2 Fab reduces pulmonary melanoma
metastasis in mice
We next evaluated the potency of the 3A2 Fab in
reducing the pulmonary metastasis in the experimental
melanoma metastasis model in mice. We specifically
selected B16F1 cells for our in vivo studies because of
their high metastatic propensity. To specifically focus
on the MT1-MMP function in metastasis, we employed
the B16F1-mMT1 cells with the enforced expression of
murine MT1-MMP and the respective control B16F1mock cells transfected with the original plasmid alone.
Multiple assays confirmed the overexpression of
the functionally active MT1-MMP in B16F1-mMT1
relative to the B16F1-mock cell control. Thus, high level
of MT1-MMP in B16F1-mMT1 cells was detected in cell
extracts analyzed by Western Blotting with the MT1-MMP
3G4 antibody (Figure 4A). Gelatin zymography analysis
of medium aliquots demonstrated that B16F1-mMT1
cells, but not the B16F1-mock control, were capable of
efficiently activating MMP-2 (Figure 4A). Finally, the
fluorescent MP-3653 reporter (a liposome tagged with a
fluorochrome and functionalized with a PEG-5000 chain
spacer linked to an inhibitory hydroxamate warhead) that
binds to the active cellular MT1-MMP alone and that
does not interact with the MT1-MMP proenzyme nor
the catalytically inactive MT1-MMP enzyme•TIMP-2
complex [53], readily highlighted B16F1-mMT1 cells
but not the control cells (Figure 4A). Based on these
tests, we concluded that the control B16F1-mock cells
were deficient in MT1-MMP, while the stably transfected
B16F1-mMT1 cells overexpressed this membrane
protease.
In our animal tests, B16F1-mMT1 cells were
injected i.v. at day 1 into athymic nude mice (n=12,
mMT1 mice). Mice injected with B16F1-mock cells
(n=6, mock mice) served as a control. Six mice from the
mMT1 group received five injections of the 3A2 Fab i.p.
(10-15 mg/kg at day 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12) (Figure 4B). Six

3A2 Fab inhibits cellular murine MT1-MMP
Because our animal studies involve mice and
because there is a four residue difference in the MT1-CAT
peptide sequence in mice versus humans (Supplementary
Figure S1), we determined if the anti-human 3A2 Fab
was species-specific. For these purposes, we performed
the MMP-2 activation assay using murine melanoma
B16F1 cells with the enforced expression of murine
MT1-MMP (B16F1-mMT1 cells). Because B16F1 cells
do not express MMP-2 naturally, the purified proMMP-2
zymogen was added to the serum-free DMEM. Cells were
then incubated in this medium with or without the 3A2
or DX2400 Fab antibodies. Medium aliquots were then
analyzed by gelatin zymography. The conversion of the
68 kDa proMMP-2 into the 64 kDa activation intermediate
and the 62 kDa mature enzyme was readily observed in
the untreated B16F1-mMT1 cells (Figure 3A). Both the
3A2 and DX2400 Fab fragments, in a dose-dependent
manner, inhibited cellular murine MT1-MMP and blocked
MMP-2 activation. We also confirmed that the 3A2 and
DX2400 antibodies did not affect the viability of B16F1mMT1 cells (data not shown).

other mMT1 mice and the mock mice (n=6) received
an injection i.p of vehicle alone. Additional three mice
were left intact and did not receive cells nor the antibody.
At day 23, mice were euthanized, and their lungs were
surgically removed, weighed and photographed (Figure
4C and 4D, Supplementary Figure S2A-S2C). Western
blotting analysis of the tissue extract confirmed the

continuing expression of MT1-MMP in the lungs
from both the mMT1 and mMT1+3A2 animal groups.
In turn, the lungs of the intact and mock mice did not
exhibit any noticeable levels of MT1-MMP. Because of
the massive melanoma lesions, the lung weight in the
mMT1 group (0.717 ± 0.160 g) greatly exceeded that

mice (0.175 ± 0.023 g). In agreement, the number of
metastatic nodules in the mMT1 group (198 ± 31) was
approximately 4-fold higher relative to the mock control
(55 ± 10). Furthermore, the nodules were bigger in
size in the mMT1 mice relative to the control animals
(Supplementary Figure S2A-S2B). In general, these
observations agree well with the results by others [12,
13, 19] and support the pro-metastatic role of MT1MMP in cancer. Importantly, the 3A2 antibody injections
significantly reduced the lung weight (0.328 ± 0.123 g)
and both the number (95 ± 28) and the size of metastatic
lesions in mice from the mMT1+3A2 group when
compared with the untreated mice from the mMT1 group

(Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure S2B-S2C), making
these parameters similar to those we recorded in the
MT1-MMP-deficient mock control.

The 3A2 Fab contained the 27-residue long, flexible
VH CDR-H3 to mimic the convex-shaped loop of TIMP-2
that interacts with the active site of MT1-MMP [54, 55].
To elucidate the mechanism of MT1-MMP inhibition
by the 3A2 antibody and identify the 3A2 epitope, we

site in the MT1-CAT molecule with that of the 3A2 and
DX2400 antibodies. For these purposes, we developed
several competitive ELISA methodologies. In the 3A2/
TIMP-2 ELISA, the 3A2 Fab was coated on plastic and
then allowed to bind to the constant amount of MT1-CAT
jointly with the increasing levels of TIMP-2. The bound
MT1-CAT was then measured using the rabbit MT1-MMP
antibody followed by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. We observed that
TIMP-2, in a dose-dependent manner, competed with the
3A2 Fab for the binding to MT1-CAT. However, even at a
high, 80:1, TIMP-2 - MT1-CAT molar ratio, TIMP-2 was
incapable of fully outcompeting the binding of the 3A2

Fab to MT1-CAT, thus implying that there was a partial
overlap between the TIMP-2 and the 3A2 binding regions
(Figure 5A). Similar observations were obtained in our
DX2400/TIMP-2 ELISA that employed the immobilized
DX2400 Fab (Figure 5A), suggesting an overlap among
the TIMP-2 and the 3A2 and DX2400 binding regions
in MT1-CAT. Our additional 3A2/DX2400 ELISA, in
which the immobilized 3A2 Fab was allowed to bind
to the constant amount of MT1-CAT jointly with the
increasing concentrations of DX2400 Fab, confirmed
that the DX2400 Fab, in a dose-dependent manner, albeit
only partially, also competed the 3A2 antibody binding to
MT1-CAT (Figure 5A).

3A2 Fab does not directly interact with the active
site zinc in MT1-MMP

competitive ELISA tests, suggested that, in contrast with
TIMP-2 and hydroxamate inhibitors, the inhibitory 3A2
and DX2400 antibodies caused MT1-MMP inactivation
without any deep penetration into the active site cavity
and without direct interference with the catalytic zinc ion.

We next determined if the 3A2 and DX2400
inhibitory mechanism resembles that of TIMP-2 and
hydroxamate inhibitors, both of which directly interact
with the active site Zn2+ binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH
in MT1-MMP [54-56]. Our 3A2/GM6001 ELISA in
which the immobilized 3A2 Fab was allowed to bind to
the constant concentration of MT1-CAT supplemented
with the increasing concentrations of GM6001 revealed
that, even at an exceedingly high, 400:1 GM6001 - MT1CAT molar ratio, the binding of the 3A2 Fab to MT1-CAT
remained unaffected (Figure 5A). This suggests that the
3A2 Fab does not interact directly with the catalytic Zn
binding motif in the MT1-MMP active site.
To corroborate these results, we next determined
if the 3A2 and DX2400 antibodies were able to affect
the binding of the fluorescent hydroxamate-based MP3653 reporter to cellular MT1-MMP [53]. Because of
the steric hindrance between the antibody and bulky
liposome-based reporter, we expected that the antibody
binding would limit the concurrent binding of the reporter
hydroxamate warhead to the MT1-MMP active site. In
these binding experiments, we used breast carcinoma
MCF7-MT1 cells stably transfected with MT1-MMP and
the control MT1-MMP-deficient MCF7-mock cells. Cells
were co-incubated with the MP-3653 reporter alone or
jointly with the 3A2 Fab or the DX2400 in its Fab or
IgG format. As controls, cells were co-incubated with the
reporter in the presence of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, GM6001
or the non-inhibitory MT1-MMP 3G4 IgG antibody. The
MP-3653 reporter readily bound to cell surface-associated
MT1-MMP in the untreated MCF7-MT1 cells but not in
MCF7-mock cells (Figure 5B). Both TIMP-2 (at a 2:1
inhibitor - reporter molar ratio) and GM6001 (at a 4:1
hydroxamate - reporter molar ratio) totally abolished the
binding of the reporter to MCF7-MT1 cells, while TIMP1 (even at a high, 40:1 inhibitor - reporter molar ratio)
was inactive. In agreement, the non-inhibitory MT1MMP 3G4 antibody also did not affect the binding of
the reporter to MCF7-MT1 cells. To our surprise, neither
the DX2400 Fab or IgG, nor the 3A2 Fab exhibited
any significant repression of the MP-3653 reporter
fluorescence in MCF7-MT1 cells. The 3A2 Fab size (≈ 75
Å in length, ≈ 50 Å in width) is >100-fold less compared
with the 10 nm PEG-5000 spacer [57] of the liposomebased reporter (Supplementary Figure S3). The PEG-5000
spacer of the MP-3653 reporter is functionalized with
the hydroxamate warhead which chelates the active site
catalytic zinc in MT1-MMP. Accordingly, it is reasonable
to expect that the hydroxamate warhead binding to the
catalytic zinc did not provide any steric hindrance for
TIMP-2, and, accordingly, for the 3A2 or DX2400 Fab
antibodies. These results, especially if combined with our

Modeling of interactions of the 3A2 Fab with
MT1-MMP
The results of our binding and competition
experiments, and the availability of the X-ray structures
of multiple human antibodies, TIMP-2, MT1-MMP and
MT1-MMP•TIMP-2 complex stimulated us to build a
crude model of the 3A2 Fab - MT1-CAT interactions.
To estimate the space occupied by the 3A2 Fab and
TIMP-2 relative to MT1-CAT, we used as templates the
structures of the MT1-MMP•TIMP-2 complex (PDB
1BQQ), of an anti-TDRD3 Fab complexed with the
tudor domain of human TDRD3 (PDB 3PNW) and of
GM6001 bound to the anthrax toxin lethal factor (PDB
4PKW). To model the 3A2 Fab structure, we used the
residue sequences of the VL and VH chains of the antiTDRD3 Fab [58] as a template. We next replaced the
original anti-TDRD3 sequences Y91GYPI95 in VL CDR-L3,
F29SSSSI34 in VH CDR-H1, S50ISSSYGYTY59 in VH
CDR-H2 and T99VRGSKKPYFSGWAMDY115 in VH
CDR-H3 with the respective VL and VH CDR sequences
of the 3A2 Fab (SSYSLIT, LSYSSM, SIYPYSGYTY
and
VKLQKDKSHQWIRNLVATPYGRYVMDY,
respectively) (Table 1).
Earlier we reported that the binding of the 3A2
Fab to MT1-CAT was affected by the F260A mutation
in the MT1-MMP sequence. Other mutations, including
T190A, F198A, Y203A, F204A and N231A (all
residues are within a 15 Å distance from the catalytic
Zn2+ atom), did not affect the antibody binding to the
protease (Supplementary Figure S1) (submitted). These
data allowed us to restrict the docking area in MT1MMP. Accordingly, we selected the N225EDLN229,
S250SDPS254 and F260YQWMDTEN268 surface regions in
the MT1-MMP structure as the 3A2 potential epitopes.
Conversely, the SSYSLIT, LSYSSM, SIYPYSGYTY
and VKLQKDKSHQWIRNLVATPYGRYVMDY VL and
VH CDR sequences represented the potential 3A2 Fab
paratopes.
We then modeled a putative quadri-molecular
complex that involved TIMP-2, GM6001, MT1-CAT and
the designed 3A2 Fab. According to our modeling, the
top scored position indicated that there was an overlap of
the 3A2 Fab moiety with the space occupied by TIMP2 in the MT1-MMP molecule (Figure 6A). These results
correlated well with the partial competition between
TIMP-2 and the 3A2 Fab we observed in our competitive
ELISA assays (Figure 5A). Our model also indicated that
TIMP-2, but not the 3A2 Fab, interacted with the catalytic

vicinity in MT1-MMP. Left, close-up of the hypothetical MT1-CAT•TIMP-2•GM6001 complex shows that the bound GM6001 penetrates
into the space occupied by TIMP-2 [46, 48, 49]. As a result, TIMP-2 and GM6001 compete for their binding to MT1-MMP. Right, two
rotated close-ups of the MT1-CAT•3A2 Fab •GM6001 complex clearly indicate that the 3A2 Fab cannot interact with the catalytic zinc
vicinity (black sphere) in the MT1-MMP active site. As a result, the 3A2 Fab did not compete with GM6001 for the binding to MT1-CAT.

Our binding and inhibitory in vitro and cellbased tests and assays convincingly demonstrated
that the 3A2 antibody is both an efficient and selective
inhibitor of cellular MT1-MMP rather than a broadspecificity MMP inhibitor. According to our tests, the
selectivity and efficiency of the 3A2 Fab was similar to
that of the DX2400 Fab, the most potent and selective
human function-blocking anti-MT1-MMP antibody. The
conversion of the DX2400 Fab into the full-length human
IgG caused a further 10-fold increase in the antibody
potency. Therefore, we expect that a similar improvement
would take place with the 3A2 Fab fragment, suggesting
that the 3A2 Fab is a very promising lead antibody against
pro-tumorigenic/metastatic MT1-MMP.
Interestingly, the 3A2 antibody binding mode was
dissimilar from that of hydroxamates that chelate the
active site catalytic zinc in MT1-MMP and of natural
protein inhibitors (such as TIMP-2) the inhibitory loop
of which penetrates deeply into the protease active site
pocket [54-56]. According to our binding, competition
and modeling studies, the 3A2 Fab epitope only partially
overlaps with the TIMP-2 binding site in the MT1-MMP
catalytic domain and does not reach out to the catalytic
zinc proximity. We believe that our modeling provided
a structural rationale for our experimental results and
sharpened a focus for our on-going mutagenesis and
antibody fine-tuning efforts. Taken together, our studies
generated a roadmap for the subsequent mutagenesis and
structure-based affinity maturation of the 3A2 antibody.
Furthermore, because of its selectivity and
low nanomolar inhibitory potency, the 3A2 antibody
represents a valuable tool for the analysis of the MT1MMP functional significance in cancer. Earlier work
by others demonstrated that in a model of advanced
peritoneal ovarian cancer, MT1-MMP-dependent
invasion and metastasis was effectively inhibited by
i.p. administration of the anti-MT1-MMP monoclonal
antibody [17]. Similarly, another selective, albeit
distinct, anti-MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody repressed
metastasis of breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells in
a mouse orthotopic xenograft model [34]. We then used
the 3A2 Fab to assess if the low, 10-15 mg/kg, antibody
amount affected the development of metastatic lesions in
the experimental pulmonary melanoma metastasis model
in mice. Our results provided experimental evidence that
the anti-MT1-MMP monotherapy caused a significant
reduction in both the number and the size of melanoma
pulmonary metastases. Our results, especially if combined
with the results by others [11-13, 19], suggest that MT1MMP plays the most critical role in the metastatic
invasion rather than in tumor development and growth.
Accordingly, we now believe that therapeutic targeting of
MT1-MMP would be most beneficial for patients suffering
from metastatic cancer and that our data would contribute
to the design of the future anti-MT1-MMP clinical trials.

Zn2+ in the MT1-MMP core, and, as a result, there was an
expected overlap of GM6001 with the TIMP-2 structure
(Figure 6B). These observations are in agreement with the
results by others [29, 54-56] as well as the data from our
ELISA and cell-based tests (Figure 5A, 5B). To validate
these data, we are currently in the process of transforming
the 3A2 Fab into its full-length IgG format. We will then
determine the crystal structure of the MT1-CAT•3A2 IgG
complex to better understand the molecular mechanism of
MT1-MMP inhibition by the 3A2 antibody.

DISCUSSION
Proteases, including MMPs, are both valuable
diagnostic markers and pharmacological targets.
Accordingly, the MMP inhibitors are expected to be
valuable drugs in multiple pathologies and, especially
in cancer. Ubiquitous pro-invasive MT1-MMP is an
archetype membrane-associated MMP and a focus of
numerous extensive studies leading to an appreciation
of this protease key functions in cell migration and
metastasis [59]. Naturally, this cell surface-associated
protease gradually became a promising drug target.
However, because of homology in the active site region of
MMPs, the small-molecule active site-targeting inhibitors
(primarily, hydroxamates that chelate the catalytic zinc
atom in the MMP active site) cross-reacted with multiple
MMPs rather than with MT1-MMP alone [29]. Off-target
effects and low net efficacy of these inhibitors caused in
their failure in clinical trials [30-32]. As a result, it is now
broadly accepted that high level of specificity is required
for pharmacological targeting of MT1-MMP.
Accordingly, high selectivity is a key parameter in a
design of a successful anti-MT1-MMP therapy. Functionblocking antibodies represent a valuable alternative to
small-molecule MMP inhibitors. Several MT1-MMP
antibodies, both murine and human, have been recently
developed and partially characterized [17, 34-36, 40, 41].
All of these antibodies target the exosites rather than the
catalytic site region of MT1-MMP. Antibody targeting of
the active site region that is buried in the MMP globule is
a challenge, especially if the conventional approaches are
employed in the library construction and antibody design.
To overcome this challenge, we designed a human
Fab antibody library in which the antibody constructs
exhibited the long, 23-27 residue, VH CDR-H3 [43].
The length of these CDR significantly exceeded that (912 residues) in human and murine antibodies [60] and
correlated with an average CDR size recorded in the
camelid antibodies [61]. Using MT1-CAT as bait, we
identified over 20 binders from which 14 performed as
inhibitors of MT1-MMP rather than as broad-specificity
antagonists. The most efficient and selective inhibitor
was the 3A2 Fab that we extensively characterized and
reported here.

was isolated from the p2AHT1A72 cells (a derivative
of HT1080 cells transfected with both the adenoviral
E1A gene and the full-length MMP-2 cDNA) [50]. The
individual catalytic domains (CAT) of human MT1-MMP,
MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP and
MT6-MMP were expressed in E. coli One Shot BL21
Star (DE3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified
proteases were then isolated from the inclusion bodies
using metal-chelating chromatography and refolded to
restore their native conformation [45]. Only the samples
with the purity >95% were used in our subsequent studies.
The refolded MT-MMPs were readily used in activity
assays. The concentration of the catalytically active
MT-MMP samples was measured using a fluorescent
assay by titration against a standard GM6001 solution of
known concentration and Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 as a
substrate. The steady-state rate of the substrate cleavage
was plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration and
fitted with the equation V=SA(E0−A(E{(E0+I+Ki)−[(E0+I
+Ki)2−E(0I]0.5}), where V, SA, E0, I and Ki are the steadystate rate of substrate hydrolysis, specific activity (rate per
unit of MMP concentration), MT-MMP concentration,
inhibitor concentration and the dissociation constant of the
MT-MMP•inhibitor complex, respectively [64, 65].

General reagents
The reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise.
The
[(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl]-Pro-Leu-GlyLeu- [N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-α,β-diaminopropionyl]Ala-Arg-NH2 (MCA-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2) fluorogenic
substrate was acquired from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN). Both murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal
MT1-MMP antibodies (3G4 and AB8345, respectively),
human α1-antitrypsin (AAT) and a broad spectrum
hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs (GM6001) were
purchased from EMD Millipore (Temecula, CA). TMB/E
substrate was from SurModics (Eden Prairie, MN). The
mammary epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM) that
included a bovine pituitary extract supplement and DMEM
were from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) and Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA), respectively. The MT1-MMP
MP-3653 fluorescent reporter that exhibited an inhibitory
hydroxamate warhead was described earlier [53]. Human
TIMP-1 was purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA). The DX2400 function-blocking human full-length
IgG1 (DX2400 IgG) antibody was kindly provided to us
by Kadmon (New York, NY).

Purified Fab fragments
The cloning, expression and isolation of the
DX2400 Fab fragment was reported earlier [66]. Both
the DX2400 full-length IgG and Fab samples were used
in our experiments for comparison purposes. From the
twenty purified human Fab constructs that were capable
of binding to MT1-MMP (submitted), the 2B5, 3A2, 3B10
and 3E9 Fab constructs were further characterized in this
study.

Cells
Human breast carcinoma MCF-7, fibrosarcoma
HT1080 and mammary epithelial 184B5 cells were
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Mouse melanoma
B16F1 cells were a generous gift by Ralph A. Reisfeld (The
Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). MCF-7, HT1080
and B16F1 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin (10 μg/
ml). Both B16F1 cells stably transfected with the original
pcDNA3-zeo vector (B16F1-mock cells) or the pcDNA3zeo plasmid encoding the full-length murine MT1-MMP
proenzyme (B16F1-mMT1 cells) and both MCF-7 cells
stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3-zeo vector
(MCF7-mock cells) or the pcDNA3-zeo plasmid encoding
the full-length human MT1-MMP (MCF7-MT1 cells)
were obtained earlier [62, 63]. 184B5 cells were routinely
maintained in MEGM-5% FBS supplemented with bovine
pituitary extract (26 µg/ml) and gentamicin. 184B5 cells
stably transfected with the original pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO
lentiviral vector (184B5-mock cells) or the lentiviral vector
encoding the MT1-MMP C-terminally tagged with a V5 tag
(185B5-MT1 cells) were constructed earlier [51].

Protease inhibition assay
The cleavage assay was performed in triplicate in
wells of a 96-well plate using the purified individual CAT
of MMPs (5 nM) and the fluorescent peptide Mca-PLGLDpa-AR-NH2 substrate (1 µM) in 0.2 ml 50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, containing 10 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 10
μM ZnCl2. Prior to the reactions, increasing concentrations
of the Fab antibodies (0-5,000 nM) were co-incubated with
the protease samples for 30 min at ambient temperature.
Initial reaction velocity was monitored continuously
at λex=320 nm and λem=400 nm using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer. The IC50 values were calculated by
determining the inhibitor concentrations that inhibited the
cleavage activity by 50%. SigmaPlot was used as fitting
software.

COL-I degradation assay

Assays were conducted in wells of a 96-well flat
bottom, white wall plates. 184B5 and B16F1-mMT cells
(7.5×104) were grown for 16 h in MEGM-5% FBS and
DMEM-10% FBS, respectively. After washing with
PBS, fresh FBS-free medium (0.1 ml) containing the
Fab antibodies (1,000 nM) was added to the cells and
incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. The

PBS) and then air dried for 16 h. The COL-I coating was
washed twice for 30 min at ambient temperature with sterile
H2O and rehydrated for 2 h at 37°C in 0.4 ml DMEM.
Seeded cells (1×105) were allowed to attach for 4 h. Fresh
DMEM (0.4 ml) containing the 3A2 Fab (200 nM), the
DX2400 Fab or IgG antibodies (100-200 nM), TIMP-1
(1,000 nM), TIMP-2 (100 nM) or GM6001 (1,000 nM) was
then added to the cells. At day 3, cells were replenished with
fresh medium supplemented with the respective inhibitors
and incubation was continued for an additional 2 days. Cells
were next detached with 0.25% trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA.
COL-I was fixed using 4% p-formaldehyde and stained
with Coomassie Blue R250. The images were captured
using a Nikon TE-2000 microscope with a ×20 objective
and a CCD camera. COL-I degradation appeared as clear
zones in the blue background.

MMP-2 gelatin zymography and Western
blotting
Following incubation of the cells (1×105/well of a
48-well plate) in serum-free medium (150 µl), the status
of MMP-2 was analyzed by gelatin zymography of the
medium aliquots (15 μl) using precast 10% acrylamide
gels co-polymerized with 0.1% gelatin (Life Technologies)
as described previously [53]. To stimulate the MMP-2
activation, HT1080 cells (1×105) were stimulated for 24
h using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) with
or without the presence of the Fab antibodies (20-200
nM), TIMP-1 (1,000 nM), TIMP-2 (100 nM) or GM6001
(1,000 nM). We also used the B16F1-mMT1 cells that
expressed the murine MT1-MMP and the respective
control B16F1-mock cells transfected with the original
plasmid alone. In the latter, cells (1×105) were seeded for
24 h in DMEM-10% FBS in wells of a 48-well plate. Cells
were replenished with fresh DMEM (150 µl) containing
purified proMMP-2 (5-10 nM) alone or jointly with the
Fab antibodies (25-200 nM) or GM6001 (1,000 nM).
In 18 h, the medium aliquots (15 μl) were analyzed by
gelatin zymography, while cells were washed with PBS
and then lysed in TBS containing 50 mM N-octyl-β-Dglucopyranoside, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride,
10 mM EDTA, and a protease inhibitor cocktail set
III. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation
(14,000×g; 30 min). The supernatant aliquots (5 μg total
proteins) were separated by electrophoresis in a 4–12%
gradient NuPAGE-MOPS gel (Life Technologies) and
analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP AB8345
antibody followed by the secondary HRP-conjugated

Cell invasion assays
The assays were conducted in wells of a 24-well, 8
μm pore size Transwell plate (Corning; Corning, NY). A 6.5mm insert membrane was coated using 0.1 ml rat tail COL-I
(0.3 mg/ml; BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ), air dried
for 16-18 h and then rehydrated for 1 h in 0.2 ml DMEM.
The inner/lower chamber contained DMEM-10% FBS as
a chemoattractant. The cells (1×105) were co-incubated for
60 min in DMEM alone or supplemented with the 3A2 and
DX2400 Fab fragments (500 nM, each), DX2400 IgG (50200 nM) or GM6001 (1,000 nM) prior to plating cells into
the outer/upper chamber. The inhibitor concentration was
identical in both the outer and inner chambers. The cells
were allowed to migrate for 16-18 h. The cells were then
removed from the membrane top surface using a cotton
swab. The cells on the membrane bottom surface were fixed
and stained using 0.2% crystal violet-20% methanol. The
incorporated dye was extracted using 1% SDS and the A590
of the extract was measured using a microplate reader. Data
are means ± SE from 3 individual experiments conducted in
triplicate. Cell invasion level was calculated relative to the
intact 184B5-MT1 cells (=100%).

Biotinylation of MT1-CAT
The refolded MT1-CAT aliquot (0.2 mg/ml in 0.7 ml
50 mM HEPES pH 7.5) was labeled for 30 min on ice at a
1:20 enzyme-biotin molar ratio using EZ-Link sulfo-NHSLC-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Excess biotin was
removed using a 0.7-ml protein desalting spin-column.

was added to the wells and incubation continued for an
additional 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS/T and
then with H2O, TMB/E substrate (0.1 ml) was added
to the wells. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 M
H2SO4 (0.1 ml) and the resulting A450 value was measured
using a plate reader. Data are means ± SE from at least 3
individual experiments performed in triplicate.

Fab antibody binding to MT1-CAT measured by
ELISA

Cell-based assay using the fluorescent MP-3653
reporter

The wells of a 96-well Maxisorp ELISA plate (Nunc;
Rochester, NY) were coated with Streptavidin (3 μg/ml, 125
μl 15 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 4°C for 18 h, then
blocked with 0.5% gelatin in TBS-0.075% Tween (TBS/T)
for 1 h at 37°C. Following two washes with TBS/T, the plate
was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature with the
biotinylated MT1-CAT sample (25 nM). The unbound MT1CAT was removed using multiple washes with TBS/T (5
min each). Increasing concentrations of the Fab antibodies
(0-8,000 nM; 50 μl TBS/T-0.5% gelatin) were allowed to
bind to MT1-CAT for 1 h at ambient temperature. Following
extensive washing with TBS/T, HRP-conjugated goat antihuman Fab (dilution 1:10,000; 50 μl TBS/T-0.5% gelatin) was
added to the wells and incubation continued for an additional
1 h. Following extensive washing with TBS/T and then with
H2O, TMB/E substrate (0.1 ml) was added to the wells. The
reaction was stopped using 1 M H2SO4 (25 µl). The resulting
A450 values were measured using a plate reader. The Kd values
were calculated by determining the inhibitor concentrations
that bound 50% of the MT1-MMP molecules. SigmaPlot was
used as fitting software. Statistical analyses were performed
using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. P values below
0.05 were considered significant. Data are means ± SE from
at least 3 individual experiments performed in triplicate.

Cells were plated in DMEM-10% FBS on a 15-mm
glass coverslip and allowed to reach a 25-50% confluency.
The cells were then washed in PBS and co-incubated for
30 min at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with either 0.2%
BSA alone or jointly with the 3A2 Fab, the DX2400 Fab
or IgG format, the 3G4 IgG control, TIMP-1 (1,000 nM,
each), TIMP-2 (50 nM) or GM6001 (100 nM). The MP3653 reporter (25 nM) was next added to the cells and
incubation continued for an additional 3 h. Cells were then
washed in PBS and fixed in 4% p-formaldehyde, mounted
in the VectaShield mounting medium containing DAPI for
the nuclear staining (Vector Lab; Burlingame, CA) and
examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
a digital camera.

Melanoma pulmonary metastasis in mice
To readily develop pulmonary metastatic lesions,
at day 1, 5-6 week-old female athymic Foxn1nu nude
mice (Envigo; Indianapolis, IN) received a single tail
vein injection of B16F1-mock and B16F1-mMT1
cells [0.2x106 in 0.2 ml Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS)] [62, 67]. Six and twelve animals received
B16F1-mock and B16F1-mMT1 cells, respectively.
Additional 3 mice were left intact and served as a control
for normal behavior and the normal lung weight. At day
1, 3, 5, 8 and 12, six animals from the B16F1-mMT1
group also received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of
the 3A2 Fab (10-15 mg/kg in 150 µl HBSS), while other
mice received the vehicle alone. At day 23, mice were
euthanized according to the NIH guidelines. The lungs
were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS and weighed.
For each mouse, the lungs were photographed and then
sectioned (Supplementary Figure S2A-S2C). Metastatic
nodules were counted using the digitized lobe images.
The lung samples were next snap-frozen. The sections
(0.15 mg each) of the lungs were extracted in 0.9 ml 20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mM NaCl,
0.5% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 1% Triton X-100,
0.1% SDS, a protease inhibitor cocktail set III, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA and 10 µM
GM6001. The solubilized material was separated from
the pellet by centrifugation (14,000×g; 30 min). The
protein concentration was then adjusted in the samples
to reach 3 mg/ml. Sample aliquots (20 μg total protein

Competition between the Fab antibodies and
TIMP-2 for the binding to MT1-CAT measured
by ELISA
Wells of a 96-well Maxisorp ELISA plate were
coated with the 3A2 or DX2400 Fab aliquots (2 μg/ml
each, 125 μl 15 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 4°C
for 18 h and then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS-0.075%
Tween (PBS/T) for 1 h at 37°C. The follow-on procedures
were carried out at ambient temperature. Following
washes with PBS/T, MT1-CAT (25 nM; PBS/T-1% BSA)
alone or jointly with increasing concentrations of TIMP2 (2-2,000 nM), DX2400 Fab (2-2,000 nM) or GM6001
(10-10,000 nM) was added to the wells and incubation
continued for 2 h. The unbound material was removed
using multiple washings in PBS/T (5 min each) and then
the rabbit MT1-MMP Ab8345 antibody (0.5 µg/ml; 0.1 ml
PBS/T-1% BSA) was added for 2 h. Following extensive
washing with PBS/T, the HRP-conjugated donkey antirabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution, 0.1 ml PBS/T-1% BSA)

In our modeling studies, we used the crystal
structure of an anti-TDRD3 Fab in its complex with the
tudor domain of human TDRD3 (PDB 3PNW) [58], MT1CAT complexed with TIMP-2 (PDB 1BQQ) [54] and the
GM6001 hydroxamate bound to the anthrax toxin lethal
factor (PDB 4PKW) [68]. The structures were analyzed
and superimposed using PyMOL. The 3A2 Fab fold was
engineered using the peptide sequence of the VL and VH
chains of the anti-TDRD3 Fab [58] as a template. In
the latter, the sequences VL CDR-L3 (Y91GYPI95), VH
CDR-H1 (F29SSSSI34), VH CDR-H2 (S50ISSSYGYTY59)
and VH CDR-H3 (T99VRGSKKPYFSGWAMDY115) were
replaced by SSYSLIT, LSYSSM, SIYPYSGYTY and
VKLQKDKSHQWIRNLVATPYGRYVMDY, respectively
(Table 1). We then combined the structure of the VL and
VH chains from 3PNW with the structure of the modified
CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 regions. The
structure of the modified CDR regions was modeled using
the server version of the Modeller program available from
ModBase [69] and the crystal structure of human prolactin
receptor complexed with Fab (PDB 4I18) [70]. Using the
FATCAT program [71], the modeled VH chain of the 3A2
Fab was then reoriented to the position of the VH chain
present in the 3PNW structure. The resulting structure
was then used in our docking experiments. The proteinprotein docking was performed using ZDOCK on-line
server [72]. For restricting docking area of MT1-MMP
with the 3A2 Fab, we selected N225EDLN229, S250SDPS254
and F260YQWMDTEN268 sequences as MT1-MMP
epitopes and the SSYSLIT, LSYSSM, SIYPYSGYTY and
VKLQKDKSHQWIRNLVATPYGRYVMDY modified
sequences in both CDRs VL and VH chains of the Fab as
paratopes. Figure 6 shows the top scored, most probable
relative fold of the hypothetical MT1-MMP•TIMP-2•3A2
Fab•GM6001 quadri-molecular complex.
