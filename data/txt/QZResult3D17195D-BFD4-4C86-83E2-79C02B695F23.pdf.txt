ABSTRACT
USP22, a member of the deubiquitinases (DUBs) family, is known to be a key
subunit of the human Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (hSAGA) transcriptional
cofactor complex. Within hSAGA, USP22 removes ubiquitin from histone proteins,
thus regulating the transcription and expression of downstream genes. USP22 plays
important roles in many cancers; however, its effect and the mechanism underlying
HCC chemoresistance remain unclear. In the present study, we found that USP22
was highly expressed in chemoresistant HCC tissues and cells and was correlated
with the prognosis of HCC patients who received chemotherapy. Silencing USP22
in chemoresistant HCC Bel/Fu cells dramatically inhibited proliferation, migration,
invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro; suppressed tumorigenic and
metastatic capacities in vivo; and inhibited drug resistance-related proteins (MDR1,
LRP, MRP1). Mechanistically, we found that USP22 knockdown exerts its function
through down-regulating PI3K and activating Smad4, which inhibited phosphorylation
of Akt. Silencing Smad4 blocked USP22 knockdown-induced Akt inhibition in Bel/Fu
cells. Our results, for the first time, provide evidence that USP22 plays a critical role in
the development of chemoresistant HCC cells and that high USP22 expression serves
as a molecular marker for the prognosis of HCC patients who undergo chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

(PRFA) are applicable treatment options for a portion of
HCC patients; the majority of advanced HCC patients
still require systemic chemotherapy [3]. However, the
development of chemoresistance occurs in most HCC
patients, leading chemotherapy failure [4].
Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) is a member
of the deubiquitinases (DUBs) family. USP22 consists
of 525 amino acids, and there is a putative ubiquitin
hydrolase containing a C-terminal peptidase domain and
an N-terminal UBP-type zinc ﬁnger motif that mediates

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common malignancies and accounts for the second highest
cancer-related mortality. There are approximately 800,000
new cases of liver cancer and 750,000 deaths worldwide
per year. There is a high incidence of HCC in China, with
China alone accounting for approximately 50% of the
total number of cases and deaths [1, 2]. Liver resection,
transplantation and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation

the association of these enzymes with other proteins [5–7].
In addition, as a crucial subtype of human Spt-Ada-Gcn5
acetyltransferase (hSAGA), USP22 promotes the stability
of multiple cancer-associated protein targets through
deubiquitylation and influences oncogene accumulation [7,
8]. Furthermore, USP22 has been considered to be a protooncogene because its expression is signiﬁcantly upregulated
in malignant tumors of several tissues, including the cervix,
colon and liver [9, 10], and it participates in regulating
proliferation, metastasis and recurrence [6].
Multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor cells is
characterized by resistance to a variety of different structures
and different functions or to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents. MDR alters the microenvironment and decreases
the efficacy of cytotoxic agents, leading to increased
DNA repairation, decreased cell apoptosis and changes in
drug metabolism [11, 12]. In general, the most important
mechanism underlying MDR is the overexpression of the
adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC)
super-family of transporters, which efflux both cytotoxic
agents and targeted anticancer drugs using ATP driven
energy [13]. P-gp, LRP and MPR1 are reported to be MDRrelated genes. Up-regulation of these proteins promotes
chemoresistance, whereas down-regulation of them makes
tumor cells more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents
[14, 15]. Moreover, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) is also regarded to be an important pathological
process in acquired resistance [16]. Therefore, clarification
of the causes and mechanism of MDR is very important for
HCC patients undergoing chemotherapy.
In this study, we found that USP22 was
overexpressed in chemoresistant HCC tissues, indicating
that USP22 might be correlated with the development of
chemoresistance in HCC. In addition, we present evidence
that USP22 promotes Bel/Fu cell growth, migration,
invasion, EMT and chemoresistance. These functional
effects of USP22 were exerted through up-regulation of
Smad4 and suppression of Akt.

and 1C). As shown in Figure 1D and 1E, the USP22
expression level in the chemoresistance group was higher
than in the chemosensitive group. We also tested USP22
expression in vivo, and the HCC cell lines expressed
higher levels of USP22 than cells of the normal liver cell
line L02 (Figure 1F and 1G). Interestingly, compared with
Bel-7402 (Bel) cells, USP22 expression was higher in Bel7402/5-fluorouracil (Bel/Fu) cells.
We next examined USP22 protein expression in
HCC samples using IHC. As expected, USP22 expression
was higher in the R group than the nR group (Figure 2A
and 2B). To further determine the relationship between
USP22 expression and clinicopathological parameters,
these 52 cases were divided into two subgroups: “low
USP22 expression” and “high USP22 expression”, as
defined in the immunohistochemical analysis subsection
of the “materials and methods” section. Significant
correlations were found between USP22 expression and
the tumor size, tumor differentiation and TNM stage.
There were no statistically significant differences between
USP22 expression and the other clinicopathological
parameters, such as patient age, gender, HBsAg and AFP
(Table 1). The association between USP22 expression and
survival time was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
The overall survival time of the high USP22 expression
group was significantly shorter than that of the low USP22
expression group (Figure 2C). These results indicate a
functional role of USP22 in the chemoresistance of HCC.

USP22 knockdown inhibited growth of HCC
chemoresistant cells
To test the functions of USP22 in HCC
chemoresistance, we silenced USP22 in Bel/Fu cells,
and the expression of USP22 was verified by RT-PCR
and western blotting (Figure 3A and 3B). As shown in
Figure 3C to 3E, silencing USP22 significantly inhibited
proliferation and generated a smaller number of colonies
in Bel/Fu cells. To further understand the role of USP22
in the control of HCC chemoresistant cell growth, we
performed flow cytometry. Silencing USP22 promoted
Bel/Fu cell apoptosis (Figure 3F and 3G), but had no effect
on cell cycle progression (Figure 3H and 3I). We also
found that USP22 knockdown enhanced the anti-growth
and pro-apoptotic effect of 5-Fu in Bel/Fu cells (Figure 3J–
3L). USP22 knockdown also decreased the expression
of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and increased the expression of
cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9. In addition,
USP22 knockdown combined with 5-Fu treatment further
enhanced the down-regulation of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and upregulated cl-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 (Figure 3M).
Bel/Fu-control cells and Bel/Fu-USP22-shRNA
cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. The
tumor size was measured every week for up to 5 weeks.
Consistent with the in vitro observations, silencing USP22
led to a dramatic decrease in tumor volume and weight
compared with the control cells (Figure 4A–4C), and also

RESULTS
Aberrant expression of USP22 in HCC was
correlated with chemoresistance
To investigate whether USP22 is involved in HCC
chemoresistance, the clinical data and tissues of 52 HCC
patients who received TACE treatment after curative
resection between 2009 and 2012 at the Second Hospital
of Dalian Medical University were collected. The mRNA
expression levels of MDR1, LRP and MRP1 in HCC
tissues were determined using RT-PCR (Figure 1A).
Based on the expression levels of MDR1, LRP and MRP1,
the HCC tissues were divided into the chemoresistance
(no-Resistance, nR) group and chemosensitive
(Resistance, R) group. Both mRNA and protein expression
of USP22 were detected in these two groups (Figure 1B

Taken together, these results suggest that USP22 is an
important regulator of growth and chemoresistance in
HCC chemoresistant cells.

cells.

USP22 knockdown decreased MDR-related
genes expression through up-regulation of
Smad4 and suppression of Akt

USP22 knockdown suppressed migration and
invasion of HCC chemoresistant cells

To better understand the mechanisms by which
USP22 is involved in the development of chemoresistance
in HCC, we performed gene expression profiling on Bel/
Fu-USP22-shRNA cells and control cells. Microarray
analyses identified a list of genes that were significantly
differentially expressed after USP22 knockdown,
including down-regulation of PI3K, Akt and up-regulation
of Smad4 (data not shown). Gene set enrichment analysis
indicated that proliferation, motility, cell movement
and invasion related gene signatures were significantly
changed in USP22 silenced cells, including the PI3K/
Akt pathway (Figure 6A), supporting the idea that USP22
regulates proliferation, migration and invasion of Bel/
Fu cells. We verified PI3K, Akt and Smad4 expression
by western blotting, and the results agreed with those of
the microarray analyses (Figure 6B). These data led us to
hypothesize that USP22 regulates these functions possibly
via regulating Smad4 and the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Next, we assessed the effect of USP22 on migration
and invasion of HCC chemoresistant cells. Silencing
USP22 decreased the migration and invasion of Bel/Fu
cells, and combination with 5-Fu further decreased the rate
of migration and number of invading cells (Figure 5A–5D).
EMT has been confirmed to be a key contributor to
tumor migratory and invasive capacities. We investigated
whether USP22 exerts the anti-migration and antiinvasion activities that accompany EMT regulation. The
assessment of EMT in cell lines has been reported based
on the analysis of changes in the expression of molecular
markers, including E-cadherin and N-cadherin [17, 18].
As shown in Figure 5E, the expression of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin was higher in USP22 silenced cells than
in the control cells. In contrast, the mesenchymal marker,
N-cadherin, was decreased in USP22 silenced cells.
Therefore, these findings suggest that USP22 promotes

with clinicopathological parameters in these 52 HCC
cases. Patients with high expression of USP22 and low
expression of Smad4 significantly has lower AFP, smaller
tumor size and higher TNM stage (Table 2).
We next examined whether Smad4 and PI3K/
Akt are crucial for USP22 regulated chemoresistance

in HCC cells. Compared with Bel/Fu-con-shRNA cells,
silencing UPS22 inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K
and Akt, enhanced epxression of Smad4 and promoted
phosphorylation of Smad4 (Figure 6C). mRNA expression
of MDR-related genes were also decreased after USP22
konckdown (Figure 6D). By contrast, silencing Smad4
rescued the impaired phosphorylation of Akt and the

but has no effect on p-PI3K (Figure 6E and 6F). And
silencing Smad4 made Bel/Fu-USP22-shRNA cells rechemoresistance to 5-Fu (Figure 6G and 6H).
These results suggest that USP22 knockdowninduced chemosensitivity of HCC cells by downregualting PI3K and Akt, and Smad4-mediated Akt
suppression as well.

whether USPP22 is involved in HCC chemoresistance; the
underlying mechanism is also unknown.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to identify the effect of USP22 on chemoresistance in
HCC. We found that USP22 expression was higher in
HCC chemoresistant tissues than in chemosensitive ones,
and a high USP22 expression was correlated with a poor
prognosis. Silencing USP22 in Bel/Fu cells inhibited
proliferation, migration, invasion and chemoresistance
both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that USP22 exerted
its function through PI3K/Akt pathway. Silencing Smad4
reversed the inhibition of Akt and MDR-related genes
caused by USP22 knockdown in Bel/Fu cells (Figure 7).
5-Fu can interfere with nucleoside metabolism and
result in DNA synthesis disorders and RNA dysfunction,
leading to cytotoxicity and cell death and has already
been used in a variety of tumors [24]. Many factors
have been identified in the development of resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents, such as elevated expression of drug
efflux transporters; changes in drug kinetics; amplification of
drug targets or the transition from epithelial to mesenchymallike cells, which comprises genetic variation; and the tumor
microenvironment [25]. In our study, when we silenced
USP22 in Bel/Fu cells, the expression of MDR1, LRP and
MRP1 decreased and cells transitioned from mesenchymal to
epithelial-like cells, leading to enhanced sensitivity to 5-Fu.
These results may be the reason why high USP22 expression
indicates insensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, tendency
to metastasis and a poor prognosis in HCC.

DISCUSSION
HCC easily acquires chemoresistance. Thus,
conventional chemotherapy treatments achieve poor
efficacy in patients with advanced HCC and show
little benefit to overall survival. Deubiquitination is
the process of removing ubiquitin from a substrate.
As a crucial type of post-translational modification,
deubiquitination is involved in diverse biological
behaviors, including regulation of protein activity and
cellular homeostasis. A disturbed balance between
ubiquitination and deubiquitination also results in a variety
of pathologic processes [19, 20]. USP22 is a novel human
deubiquitinating enzyme. USP22 may deubiquitinate H2A
and H2B, subunits of the hSAGA complex that activate
transcription factors and promote carcinogenesis [21]. Our
previous work has demonstrated that increased expression
of USP22 in HCC might be important for tumor
progression and can serve as an independent biomarker
for poor survival [22, 23]. However, it remains unclear

The PI3K pathway comprises a family of
intracellular signal transducer enzymes with three key
regulatory nodes: PI3K, AKT, and mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR). PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid
kinases that are composed of a regulatory subunit and
a catalytic subunit that are encoded by different genes.
One of the main functions of PI3K is to synthesize the
secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol triphosphatase
(PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2).

The generation of PIP3 activates PI3K, following Akt
recruitment at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.
At the membrane, another PH-domain containing serine/
threonine kinase, named 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase-1 (PDK1), phosphorylates Akt [26].
Akt activation by phosphorylation regulates critical
cellular activities, such as protein synthesis, growth,
differentiation, metabolism, and survival, as well as
tumorigenesis [26, 27]. Our present study identified

a list of genes differentially expressed after USP22
knockdown, including Smad4 and genes of the PI3K/
Akt pathway. Silencing Smad4 reversed the inhibition
of Akt and MDR-related proteins according to USP22
knockdown. Therefore, we suggest that USP22 regulates
the chemoresistance of HCC by Smad4/Akt-dependent
MDR-related genes modulation.
In summary, USP22 knockdown results in the upregulation of epithelial marker and the down-regulation
of mesenchymal marker, thereby preventing Bel/Fu cells
from becoming metastatic. Moreover, USP22 knockdown
also decreases MDR-related genes expression by inhibiting
Akt phosphorylation, and USP22 knockdown mediated
Smad4 up-regulation is crucial for Akt suppression. Both
the regulation of EMT and the expression of MDR-related
genes are responsible for the enhanced sensitivity to 5-Fu
in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we suggest USP22 to be
a new therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of
chemotherapy in HCC patients.

Human tumor tissues were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight and subsequently embedded in
paraffin wax. Sections were cut at a thickness of 4 μm and
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological
analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for
different markers in arrays as previously described [28].
The proportion of stained cells (lower, < 30% staining;
higher, ≥ 30% staining) was semiquantitatively determined
following published protocols [29].

Cell lines and cell culture
The normal human liver cell line L02 and the HCC
cell lines HepG2, SK-Hep-1, Li-7, Huh7, SMMC-7721,
and Bel-7402 were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Danvers, MA, USA). Cells
from the lines L02, HepG2, SK-Hep1, Huh7, and SMMC7721 were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Li-7 and Bel-7402 cells were
cultured in 1640 medium (Invitrogen). To obtain 5-Furesistant Bel-7402 (Bel/Fu) cells, Bel-7402 cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
1.0  ×  10-7 mol/l 5-Fu (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) for 6 months. Once the drug resistance assessment
was successful, the cells were cultured in 1640 medium.
All media were supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen).
Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and specimens
Tumor tissues that were used for RT-PCR and
western blotting were collected from 52 HCC patients
who underwent TACE after curative resection with
informed consent between 2009 and 2011 at the Second
Hospital of Dalian Medical University. Tumor staging
was based on the 6th edition of the tumor-node-metastasis
(TNM) classification of the International Union Against
Cancer. Follow-up data were summarized at the end of
March 2016, with a median observation time of 34.4
months. The study protocols were approved by the
Hospital Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of
Dalian Medical University. Written informed consent
based on the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from
the patients.

Establishment of USP22 knockdown and Smad4
stable expression cell lines
Lentiviral vector-mediated RNA interference was
used to infect Bel/Fu cells as a negative control, and a
USP22-special shRNA lentivirus was prepared and used
to infect Bel/Fu cells as previously described [30]. Bel/
Fu cells expressing Smad4 were established as previously

described [31]. The expression of USP22 and Smad4 was
confirmed by western blotting analysis.

Cells were seeded into 6-cm culture plates. The cell
monolayers were wounded using 200-μl micropipette
tips and photographed using microscopy at desired time
points. The migration distance of each cell was measured
by Image-pro Plus.

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates in triplicate at
densities of 3000 per well. Cell viability was monitored
at desired time points using the Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK8, KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell invasion and migration assay
The invasion of cells was measured in matrigelcoated (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) transwell inserts
(6.5 mm, Costar, Manassas, VA, USA) containing
polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores. The inserts were
coated with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml Matrigel matrix according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A quantity of
2 × 105 cells in 200 μl of serum-free medium were plated
in the upper chamber, whereas 300 μl of medium with
10% fetal bovine serum were added to the lower well.
After 24 h incubation, the cells that invaded the lower
surface of the membrane were fixed and stained. Five
random fields were counted at ×10 magnification for each
membrane. Migration assays were similar to invasion
assay except that the transwell insert was not coated with
matrigel.

Colony formation assay
A total of 500 cells/well were seeded into 6-well
plates in triplicate. After 2 weeks of growth, the cells were
fixed and stained with crystal violet. Visible colonies were
counted according to the cell numbers in each colony.

Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2×105 cells/
well). For cell cycle analysis, the cells were harvested
and resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4°C
and left overnight. The fixed cells were centrifuged and
washed with PBS. After incubation with 100 μl of RNase
A (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, cells were resuspended
in 400 μl of PI (50 μg/ml) and placed in the dark at room
temperature for 30 min. For apoptosis analysis, the
cells were digested and resuspended in binding buffer
to prepare single cell suspensions. Then, the cells were
stained using the annexin V-FITC reaction reagent (5 μl of
annexin V-FITC, 5 μl of propidium iodide) and incubated
in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the
stained cells were analyzed.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Blocked with 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by the primary
and second antibodys sequentially. The nuclei were
stained with DAPI. The images were captured using a

Nude mice were purchased from the SPF Laboratory
Animal Center at Dalian Medical University. All animals
were used in accordance with institutional guidelines, and
the current experiments were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee. Bel/Fu-Con-shRNA cells
(1 × 107/ 100 µl) were resuspended in PBS and inoculated
subcutaneously into 6 nude mice that were 4 weeks old.
In a similar procedure, Bel/Fu-USP22-shRNA cells were
inoculated into 18 nude mice that were 4 weeks old. Two
weeks later, when the tumor diameters had reached 4 mm
to 5 mm, 12 of the Bel/Fu-USP22-shRNA inoculated
mice were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 6/group)
that were administered either 30 mg/kg 5-Fu in the 5-Fu
group or normal saline in the NS group. These agents
were intraperitoneally injected three times per week for
six weeks. The tumors were measured weekly and the
tumor volume was calculated according to the formula
length × width2/2. The mice were killed at six weeks after
inoculation, and the weight of the tumors in each mouse
was measured.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer on ice
supplemented with 1 mM PMFS and 1 mM phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail to obtain total cellular protein. Protein
concentrations were determined using a BCA protein
assay kit. The protein samples (30 μg) were mixed
with loading buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes
were then blocked and incubated with the primary and
secondary antibodies. Then, the bands were visualized by
chemiluminescence.

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed by
all authors.

Total RNA quality and quantity were determined
using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and NanoDrop ND-1000.
Affymetrix HU U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The data were initially
normalized by robust multiarray average (RMA)
normalization algorithms in expression console software
(Affymetrix). Significantly altered genes between USP22
knockdown and its control cells were considered by scatter
plots, and the genes were up- and downregulated ≥ 5-fold.
Clustering analysis was performed using the gene list by
Gene Cluster v3.0 software. Gene set enrichment analysis
was conducted using ConceptGen (http://conceptgen.
ncibi.org/core/conceptGen/index.jsp). Gene sets were
obtained either from ConceptGen or from published gene
signatures.

Statistical analysis
The correlations between USP22 expression and age,
sex, tumor size, TNM stage, and other clinicopathologic
parameters (Table 1) were evaluated using a chi-square (χ2)
test. The correlations of clinicopathologic parameters among
the four groups were evaluated using fisher's exact test. The
survival probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and the significant difference between high USP22
and low USP22 groups was determined using the log-rank
test. Comparisons among multiple groups were made with
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Dunnet t-test. All experiments were repeated three times.
Data were expressed as the mean ± SD and were analyzed
using the Student’s t-test. The statistical significance of
the differences between mean values was determined by
P < 0.05. SPSS 16.0 software was used for all statistical
analysis.
