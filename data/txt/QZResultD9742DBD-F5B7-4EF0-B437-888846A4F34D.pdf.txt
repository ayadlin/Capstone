Abstract
Combining cell-cycle checkpoint kinase inhibitors with the
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine offers clinical
appeal, with a mechanistic rationale based chieﬂy on abrogation of
gemcitabine-induced G2–M checkpoint activation. However, evidence supporting this mechanistic rationale from chemosensitization studies has not been consistent. Here we report a systematic
deﬁnition of how pancreatic cancer cells harboring mutant p53
respond to this combination therapy, by combining mathematical
models with large-scale quantitative biologic analyses of single cells
and cell populations. Notably, we uncovered a dynamic range of
mechanistic effects at different ratios of gemcitabine and CHK1
inhibitors. Remarkably, effective synergy was attained even where
cells exhibited an apparently functional G2–M surveillance mechanism, as exempliﬁed by a lack of both overt premature CDK1

activation and S-phase mitotic entry. Consistent with these ﬁndings, S–G2 duration was extended in treated cells, leading to a
deﬁnable set of lineage-dependent catastrophic fates. At synergistic
drug concentrations, global replication stress was a distinct indicator of chemosensitization as characterized molecularly by an
accumulation of S-phase cells with high levels of hyperphosphorylated RPA-loaded single-stranded DNA. In a fraction of these cells,
persistent genomic damage was observed, including chromosomal
fragmentation with a loss of centromeric regions that prevented
proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Together, our results
suggested a "foot-in-the-door" mechanism for drug synergy where
cells were destroyed not by frank G2–M phase abrogation but rather
by initiating a cumulative genotoxicity that deregulated DNA
synthesis. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3583–95. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

(3, 4). This has subsequently inspired an accumulating body of
evidence associating CHK1 inhibition with G2–M checkpoint
abrogation, characterized by premature chromosomal condensation, inﬂated mitotic index, and aberrant chromosomal structures
(5–7). Against this background, ongoing clinical trials of CHK1
inhibitors with DNA-damaging agents are chieﬂy based on the
notion of G2–M checkpoint abrogation (8). Nonetheless, owing
to the multiple roles of CHK1 in cell-cycle regulations, it is not
deﬁnitive if this represents the predominant mechanism of chemosensitization (9).
Among all chemotherapy agents, the greatest potentiation by
CHK1 inhibitors has been reported with antimetabolites, notably gemcitabine (10). Gemcitabine is standard for patients with
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, one of the most intractable
of human malignancies (11). Here, we took a systematic
approach to elucidate how pancreatic tumor cells responded
to gemcitabine and CHK1 inhibition. Using mathematical
models coupled with cytotoxicity assays, we ﬁrst identiﬁed
concentration ratios of gemcitabine and CHK1 inhibitors that
induced synergistic growth inhibition. We then used population- and single-cell–based assays to quantitatively deﬁne cellcycle modulation and cell behaviors. Our study reveals a level
of mechanistic complexity that offers conceptually important
insights into the dynamic interplay between gemcitabine and
CHK1 inhibition.

The DNA damage response (DDR) to a vast majority of genomic insults is orchestrated by the activation of 2 key PI3K-related
kinases, ATM and ATR. Upon recruitment to damage sites, ATM
and ATR phosphorylate a number of substrates, including checkpoint kinase CHK1 (CHEK1), which in turn mediate cell-cycle
arrest to facilitate DNA repair (1). An intact ATM/ATR-CHK1
signaling cascade is integral to genomic integrity and therefore
survival. Because cancer cells frequently harbor surveillance
defects, they are reliant on the residual functional processes of
the DDR machinery (2). Inhibition of the DDR with checkpoint
kinase inhibitors thus heralds a promising cancer therapeutic
strategy for chemosensitization.
Early prototypes of nonselective checkpoint kinase inhibitors
caffeine and UCN-01 have been shown to induce unscheduled
mitosis following abrogation of DDR-induced cell-cycle arrest

Mechanistic Insights on CHK1 Inhibition

(IMR-90) were obtained from either the European Collection
of Cell Cultures or the ATCC. They were authenticated using
either Promega GenePrint10 System or Promega PowerPlex
16HS kit and were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS (GIBCO).
Murine pancreatic cancer cells K8484 were established from a
KRasG12D; p53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mouse (12) and were grown in
DMEM with 5% FBS. All cell lines were grown up to a maximum
of 20 passages and for fewer than 6 months following resuscitation. They were routinely veriﬁed to be mycoplasma-free using the
Mycoprobe Mycoplasma Detection Kit (R&D Systems). Gemcitabine (Tocris), S1181 (Sentinel Oncology; patent application:
WO/2011/141716, compound Example 20), CHIR-124 (Selleck
Chemicals), roscovitine (Sigma-Aldrich), Cdc7i (PHA 767491,
Tocris), and CDK1i (RO-3306, Calbiochem) were dissolved in
DMSO in aliquots of 10 to 30 mmol/L, kept at 20 C, and used
within 3 months. Final DMSO concentrations (0.2%) were kept
constant in all experiments.
Cell-cycle synchronization and ﬂow cytometry
For G1–S synchronization, thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile PBS and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mmol/L
following a 16-hour block/8-hour release/16-hour block protocol.
For G2–M synchronization, CDK1i (RO-3306, Calbiochem) was
dissolved in DMSO and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 9 mmol/L for
20 hours. To analyze cell-cycle distributions, cells were trypsinized,
ﬁxed with either 70% ethanol or 4% paraformaldehyde, stained
with antibodies, and counterstained with propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed on the BD FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Ten thousand or more events were collected per
sample, and data were processed using the FlowJo software.
Clonogenic assay
Cells were plated 24 hours prior to treatment. Following treatment, equal numbers of viable cells from each sample were
reseeded in fresh medium and left to grow. Seven days later, cells
were ﬁxed with 70% methanol and stained with 5% Giemsa
(Sigma-Aldrich). Colonies were imaged and quantiﬁed using the
ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Plating efﬁciency was
calculated from the ratio of the number of colonies to the number
of cells seeded. The number of colonies that arose after treatment
was expressed as surviving fraction. This was derived from the ratio
of the number of colonies formed after treatment to the number of
cells seeded multiplied by plating efﬁciency of the control.
Immunostaining and immunoblotting
For immunostaining, cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, stained with

antibodies, and counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). To visualize centromeres and kinetochores,
100% methanol ﬁxation method was used. EdU and TUNEL
Click-iT assays were performed on paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed
samples based on Click-iT reaction according to manufacturer's
instructions (Life Technologies). For immunoblotting, wholecell extracts were obtained by lysis in RIPA buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L sodium chloride,
1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and
resolved using the SDS-PAGE gel system (Life Technologies).
Blots were analyzed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR).
IncuCyte time lapse imaging
Images were acquired with the IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging
microscopy (Essen Bioscience) at every 3 hours under cell culture
conditions with 10 objective. Averaged cell conﬂuence was
calculated from 3 random ﬁelds of view per well using the
IncuCyte in-built algorithm. Relative conﬂuence values were
obtained by normalizing each value to the time zero value in
each sample.
Metaphase spreads
Cells were treated with 0.1 mg/mL colcemid for 45 minutes,
trypsinized, and treated in a dropwise manner with prewarmed
0.075 mol/L KCl. After 15-minute incubation at 37 C, cells were
sequentially ﬁxed in freshly prepared methanol:acetic acid mix
(3:1 then 3:2). After an overnight incubation at 20 C, cells were
dropped onto coverslips and stained with ProLong Gold Antifade
Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism built-in tests. For
comparison among three or more groups, an ordinary one-way
ANOVA analysis followed by post hoc tests was performed. The
following asterisk rating system for P value was used:  , P  0.05;

, P  0.01;  , P  0.001;  , P  0.0001.
Supplementary Materials and Methods include antibodies;
cytotoxicity agent combination assay and synergy calculation;
acquisition, processing, and analysis of live cell time lapse
sequences; and quantitative ﬂuorescence-based microscopy.

Results
Mathematical modeling identiﬁes effective synergy between
gemcitabine and CHK1i at sub-GI50 concentrations
A drug discovery program identiﬁed S1181 as a novel selective
small-molecule inhibitor of CHK1 (IC50 ¼ 2.5 nmol/L; Fig. 1A;

treated with gemcitabine (x-axis) and S1181 (y-axis) in an 8  8 concentration checkerboard format for 72 hours. Cell viability was determined by measuring
the total protein content using the sulforhodamine B assays. The experimental data (left, values are percentage growth inhibition compared with control) were
analyzed independently with the three synergy models (Bliss, Loewe, Highest Single Agent). The predicted inhibition data by these models (middle) was
subtracted from the experimental data (left), yielding a ﬁnal difference value for each combination (right). The greater a difference value was, the more synergistic
that particular combination was. Concentrations that yielded effective synergy (as deﬁned in the text) are boxed in white in data prediction panel. Data, mean  SD,

Mechanistic Insights on CHK1 Inhibition

Supplementary Fig. S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Using
S1181 as a CHK1i tool compound, we performed sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity assays to test its effects with gemcitabine on
human cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1, HT-29) and a
mouse pancreatic cancer cell line, K8484, obtained from a
KRasG12D; p53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mouse. To objectively identify
the presence and region of synergy, we assessed each combination assay independently with three established mathematical
models, that is, Bliss, Loewe, and Highest Single Agent models
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods). To further the
stringency of our criteria, we deﬁned "effective synergy" as the
minimum concentrations that produced more than 90% growth
inhibition. Consistently, effective synergy was found at sub-GI50
concentrations in all tumor cell lines but not in nonmalignant
IMR-90 cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Target inhibition occurred at synergistic concentrations, as
demonstrated by attenuation of CHK1 autophosphorylation at
S296 and phosphorylation of ATR targets CHK1 S317 and CHK1
S345 (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1C; ref. 13). With 24 hours of
combination treatment, ATM S1981 nuclear foci were observed,
alongside the upregulation of its downstream substrates CHK2
T68 and H2AX S139 (gH2AX), implying elevated DNA
damage that involved fork breakage (Fig. 1C and D). With
72 hours of combination treatment, cell viability was severely
affected, as evidenced by increase in gH2AX, cleaved PARP and
caspase-3, apoptotic bodies, and TUNEL staining (Supplementary
Fig. S1D–S1F). Long-term clonogenic assays corroborated a durable synergistic relationship between the two agents (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Fig. S1G). Together, the data demonstrate that
sub-GI50 concentrations of gemcitabine and CHK1i are sufﬁcient
to yield synergistic growth inhibition.
Forced mitotic entry is not a common determinant of effective
synergy
A widely held assumption is that CHK1 inhibition abrogates
the G2–M checkpoint by triggering inappropriate CDK activation,
leading to forced mitotic entry. To test this notion in the context of
effective synergy, we interrogated CDK activation status (Fig. 2A).
Unexpectedly, we found no apparent disinhibition of CDK activity (i.e., no decrease in the inactive form CDK Y15) upon gemcitabine þ CHK1i treatment at synergistic concentrations. To rule
out potential off-target effects of S1181, we used another structurally distinct potent CHK1-speciﬁc inhibitor CHIR-124 and
achieved similar outcomes at relevant synergistic concentrations
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
We investigated whether these molecular changes were accompanied by forced mitosis. Both quantitative immunoblotting and
cytometry for mitotic marker HH3 S10 (pHH3) conﬁrmed
that the synergistic combination did not substantially elevate the
mitotic population compared with single-agent controls (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, DNA content of the
mitotic cells treated with the synergistic concentrations was near

4N regardless of treatment duration (24–72 hours), suggesting an
absence of forced S-phase mitotic entry (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S2D; see data for 10 nmol/L gemcitabine þ 1 mmol/L S1181).
Cancer cells display divergent mechanistic interpretations at
different concentration ratios
A potential caveat of the above ﬁndings is that they were
attained under ﬁxed ratio of gemcitabine and CHK1i and thus
did not capture the dynamic range within which synergy may
arise. To address this, we revisited the synergy plots and paired
up a ﬁxed concentration of CHK1i with low and high gemcitabine
(Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2E). CHK1i with low gemcitabine,
while synergistic, neither triggered CDK inactivation nor substantially altered the percentage of pHH3-positive population compared with single-agent control (Fig. 2C, compare lane 3 with
lane 5). Conversely, with high gemcitabine, there was obvious
G2–M checkpoint override exempliﬁed by decreased CDK Y15
and elevated pHH3 (Fig. 2C, compare lane 4 with lane 6).
Quantiﬁcation of DNA content shows that, independent of
treatment duration, pHH3-positive cells in high gemcitabine
were consistently <3N, a signature of premature S-phase mitotic
entry (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2D; see data for 100 nmol/L
gemcitabine þ 1 mmol/L S1181).
We did a reverse set of experiments, where a ﬁxed gemcitabine
was coupled with increasing CHK1i (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig.
S2F). With low synergistic CHK1i, we did not see gross G2–M
checkpoint abrogation, as there was little change in the levels of
CDK Y15 and pHH3. With higher CHK1i, CDK activation
(reduced CDK Y15) that promoted mitotic entry (elevated pHH3)
became more apparent. All these experiments were reproducible
in cell lines with different synergistic concentrations (Fig. 2C
and D; Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F). To further verify these
ﬁndings in the same setting, we used yet another cell line HT-29,
which has previously been shown to undergo unscheduled mitotic entry with CHK1 inhibition (14), and reached the same conclusions (Fig. 2E): with low synergistic gemcitabine (30 nmol/L)
and CHK1i (1 mmol/L), the percentage of mitotic cells was
not considerably different from single-agent controls and they
had 4N DNA content; with high gemcitabine (300 nmol/L)
and CHK1i (5 mmol/L), there was an increase in <4N mitotic
cells. Collectively, while our data are in line with previous reports
on G2–M checkpoint abrogation at relatively high concentrations
of gemcitabine or CHK1i, they argue for the hitherto discounted
possibility that this is dispensable at optimal synergistic ratios of
gemcitabine and CHK1i.
Delayed S progression is a denominator of cytotoxicity,
regardless of the mode of elimination
The foregoing experiments suggest that forced mitotic entry is
inadequate to explain the effective synergy between gemcitabine
and CHK1i. First, the principle of effective checkpoint abrogation
would apply if cells experience supraphysiologic levels of DNA

Mechanistic Insights on CHK1 Inhibition

damage in the ﬁrst instance; such was not the case with sub-GI50
gemcitabine alone (Figs. 1 and 2). Second, cells treated with
gemcitabine at synergistic concentrations in the absence of CHK1i
remained cycling for at least 72 hours, incongruent with the
notion of an alarmed G2–M checkpoint (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Third, given the nominal extent of checkpoint activation,
checkpoint abrogation by CHK1i would be more a conditional
than an absolute requirement for synergy, explaining the absence
of overt perturbation on CDK1 activity (Fig. 2).
To validate these conclusions, we reasoned that there must
be a mechanistic underpinning that preceded G2–M checkpoint
abrogation. We performed quantitative ﬂow cytometry to determine cell-cycle proﬁles. Consistently, gemcitabine þ CHK1i
at synergistic concentrations resulted in an increase in S-phase
population (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3B and Supplementary
Table S2). To directly correlate spatiotemporal conﬁguration
of cell-cycle dynamic with treatment conditions, we harnessed
the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator
(Fucci) technology, which distinguished S/G2–M cells from
G1 cells based on ﬂuorescently tagged forms of geminin (green)
and Cdt1 (red), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3C; ref. 15).
In tandem, we developed a live-cell tracking methodology
that allowed measurement of S–G2 duration in an automated
and reproducible fashion (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods). Analyzing more than 2,000 single cells, we found
that the averaged S–G2 duration in gemcitabine-treated cells
(10.4  0.25 hours) was 2 hours longer than control (8.6 
0.16 hours) and CHK1i (8.2  0.16 hours; Fig. 3B). Gemcitabine þ CHK1i prolonged the interphase residence time by
another 3 hours (13.3  0.53 hours), consistent with the
accumulation of the S-phase population (Fig. 3A).
Time lapse analysis showed diverse cell fates following
gemcitabine þ CHK1i (Fig. 3C). To facilitate comparative
analyses without compromising the complexity, the ﬁrst-generation fate proﬁle of each individual cell from the time of
treatment to the end of ﬁrst mitosis (if occurred) was plotted
(Fig. 3D). Of the 115 asynchronous cells, 83 cells proceeded to
the next cell cycle whereas 32 cells experienced adverse fate in
the ﬁrst observed cell cycle. Among these 32 cells, 2 died in
mitosis, 15 failed cytokinesis, whereas the remaining 15 experienced prolonged arrest (3), senescence (7), or death (5) in S–
G2 interphase without ever entering mitosis. Notably, 23 of 29
cells in the fourth quartile of S–G2 duration experienced
adverse fates. All these data stood in contrast to the ﬁrstgeneration fate proﬁles of the control, where all the 100 cells
entered mitosis following a relatively short S–G2 duration and

successfully underwent cytokinesis (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Together, these data support a model where, irrespective of how
a cell is eliminated, prolonged S duration appears to be a key
that presages an unfavorable biologic event.
Cell fate is inﬂuenced by the extent of agent exposure across
generations
If the above hypothesis is generally applicable, we postulated
that there should be a lineage-dependent phenomenon where cell
fate could be extrapolated from the initial state of a cell. To test
this, we ﬁrst performed a pedigree examination (Supplementary
Fig. S3E). We tracked cells that underwent one mitotic division to
identify daughter cells derived from the same mother. We then
determined the fate of 75 pairs of sisters. We found that most
sisters shared the same fate upon gemcitabine þ CHK1i. On the
basis of this and our earlier results, we reasoned that cell fate
decision could be dependent on the degree of maternal exposure
during S–G2. Strikingly, we found that offspring of mothers with
protracted S–G2 progression were more prone to some form of
adverse fate (failed cytokinesis, interphase arrest, senescence,
death) than those with mothers of shorter S–G2 duration
(Fig. 3E). Furthermore, linearity between the S–G2 duration and
mitotic duration implies a causal connection between the interphase state and subsequent mitotic state, providing an explanation to previous work that implicates CHK1i in activating the
spindle assembly checkpoint (16).
Next, we asked whether S–G2 duration progressively lengthened through generations. To address this in a manner that ensured complete retrieval of temporal data, we focused on cells
that were in G1 phase at the start of each experiment and that
had at least one dividing daughter. Signiﬁcantly, S–G2 duration
doubled over two generations (Fig. 3F). This was accompanied
by a 5-fold increase in mitotic duration (Supplementary Fig. S3F).
Furthermore, virtually all second-generation cells affected by the
temporal inﬂation failed to divide, consistent with the phenomenon seen in the ﬁrst-generation population. As a unifying validation to all our ﬁndings, we determined the S–G2 and mitotic
durations of cells that proceeded into the second cell cycle to
correlate them to their fate. Whereas 72% (83 of 115 cells)
underwent division in the ﬁrst cell cycle, the percentage dropped
to 15% (25 of 164 cells) in the second round (Supplementary
Fig. S3G). Moreover, in daughters that attempted a second mitosis, we again saw a positive association between the length of S–G2
and mitosis, with those cells at the higher ends being more
vulnerable to cytokinesis failure (Supplementary Fig. S3H).
Together, our lineage-tracing analyses highlight the effects of

Mechanistic Insights on CHK1 Inhibition

agent exposure during interphase and how that could propagate
across the descendants of an insulted cell.
CHK1 inhibition triggers global replication stress by
deregulating the replication checkpoint
The distinctive phenotype of perturbed S progression
prompted us to interrogate the intra-S replication activity upon
treatment. First, we synchronized MIA PaCa-2 cells at the G1–S
border and released them into treatment conditions, labeling with
EdU over 1 to 4 hours (Fig. 4A). To enumerate the fraction of
replicating cells, we used quantitative ﬂuorescence-based microscopy, which enabled the analysis of thousands of single-cell
measurements based on multiple parameters of the ﬂuorescent
readout (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). We found
that CHK1i caused a more rapid initial uptake of EdU in MIA
PaCa-2 cells compared with control or gemcitabine 2 to 3 hours
following release. When asynchronous populations of another
cell line HT-29 were treated with CHK1i and then labeled with a
shorter pulse of EdU, we again observed a signiﬁcant increase in
replicating cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Collectively, the data
suggest enforced initiation and promotion of DNA synthesis with
CHK1 inhibition.
Forced DNA synthesis is a source of replication stress (17). In
response to replication stress, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)coating trimeric RPA protein is recruited and phosphorylated at
multiple sites, with RPA32 S4/8 being found in the most
hyperphosphorylated form of the protein (18). We observed
an increase in phosphorylated RPA upon gemcitabine þ CHK1i
treatment but not with either agent alone (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). This exclusivity highlights the dependency between the
two agents in deregulating the replication program. Furthermore, quantitative microscopy reveals that cells with the highest degree of RPA32 S4/8 were also experiencing substantial
fork breakage, as evidenced by co-staining with gH2AX (Fig. 4B;
Supplementary Fig. S4C). The majority of these cells were in
S-phase (Supplementary Fig. S4D). High-resolution confocal
imaging shows nucleus-wide staining of activated RPA in these
cells, indicative of long stretches of ssDNAs with stalled replication forks (Supplementary Fig. S4E). On the other hand,
gH2AX was found in heterochromatic regions, consistent with
the presence of replication intermediates refractory to repair
(19). Together, the data suggest that gemcitabine þ CHK1i
overloads the replication machinery through improper initiation and promotion of DNA synthesis, eventually leading to the
pathologic outcome of unresolved DNA lesions.
A reverse prediction was that suppression of DNA synthesis
should relieve global replication stress. To this end, we exploited

the paradigm that CHK1 regulates origin activity and that origin
activity requires CDK2 (20). We found that application of a
broad CDK inhibitor roscovitine with gemcitabine þ CHK1i
reversed S-phase accumulation within 12 hours (Fig. 4C). By 24
hours, roscovitine markedly subdued gH2AX and RPA32 S4/8
expressions in treated cells, indicating mitigation of replication
stress (Fig. 4D). These results were reproduced by inhibiting
Cdc7, another regulator of origin ﬁring (Fig. 4C and D).
Given that inhibition of CDKs and Cdc7 is cytostatic, a
counter-argument would be that the apparent rescue was an
indirect effect of reduced genome incorporation of gemcitabine. To address this, we asked whether restraining DNA
replication in gemcitabine þ CHK1i could abolish the synergistic growth inhibition. We performed long-term proliferation
studies (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Fig. S4F). Signiﬁcantly, cell
proliferation was restored to control levels by roscovitine and
Cdc7i, partially or fully so depending on cell lines. Substituting
roscovitine with a speciﬁc CDK1i at subarresting concentrations did not redress growth retardation by gemcitabine þ
CHK1i (Supplementary Fig. S4G). Together, these data show
that, at sub-GI50 concentrations, CHK1i synergizes with gemcitabine mainly by perturbing the S-phase homeostasis
through deregulated DNA replication, not by G2–M checkpoint abrogation.
Mitotic aberrance is a consequence of deranged replication
machinery
Emerging evidence suggests that genomic insults in interphase
can persist into mitosis (21). Given that a fraction of cells
underwent prolonged mitosis upon gemcitabine þ CHK1i, we
proceeded to determine the nuclear morphology of these cells.
Aberrant mitotic architectures were signiﬁcantly found in the
combination treatment (Fig. 5A and B). These included misaligned metaphases, lagging chromosomes, and anaphase bridges.
When cells were synchronized at the G2–M border and released
into gemcitabine þ CHK1i, there was no evidence of gross mitotic
aberrance (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This ruled out the possibility
that CHK1 mitotic role was compromised (22). Together, the data
suggest that preceding replication mishap is responsible for the
aberrant mitotic manifestations.
We noticed that misaligned metaphases with dramatic dispersion of chromosomes were particularly common with CHK1
inhibition. Previous studies have invariably attributed this
feature to checkpoint bypass but have variously described it
as disorganized spindle (23), centromere fragmentation (24),
and failure of chromosomes with intact centromeres to align
along the metaphase plate (14). To clarify, we stained cells for

Mechanistic Insights on CHK1 Inhibition

tubulin and found apparently normal bipolar microtubule
organization (Fig. 5A). With z-stack confocal analysis, we
found core component of kinetochore outer plate HEC1 colocalizing exclusively with chromosomes at the metaphase plate
(Fig. 5C). This was accompanied by the presence of genome
material separate from the plate, indicative of acentric chromosomes. Similar spatial conﬁguration was also observed with
centromere DNA-binding CENP-B. Given that (peri)centromeric structures arise from heterochromatin, damage in this region
would conceivably result in their defective formation. This is
consistent with the observation that only with CHK1 inhibition
(with or without gemcitabine) did gH2AX propagate into
heterochromatin (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
An alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation was
chromosomal fragmentation, a phenomenon increasingly recognized as a form of mitotic death but often confused with
premature chromosomal condensation (PCC; ref. 25). To formally investigate this possibility, we performed immunoﬂuorescence and found that (i) gH2AX decorated aberrant mitoses,
more so in those with severely tattered chromosomes (Fig. 5D),
(ii) mitoses were EdU-negative and were not actively replicating
(Fig. 5E), and (iii) mitotic aberrance was not abolished by CDK
inhibitor cotreatment (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Furthermore,
independent of combination treatment duration (24–72
hours), metaphase spreads showed various stages of chromosomal breakage demonstrated by differential cut sizes, suggesting that it was a cumulative process that occurred at single-cell
level (Fig. 5F). Together, these data conﬁrm chromosomal
fragmentation, preclude PCC (26), and premise that the replication crisis invoked by gemcitabine þ CHK1i could progressively culminate in mitotic disaster.

Discussion
An overwhelming body of literature proposes that checkpoint
abrogation by CHK1i in gemcitabine-treated cells drives them
into premature mitosis. However, such abrogation has never been
formally established as the cause of chemosensitization (9).
Importantly, G2–M checkpoint bypass by CHK1i does not always
correlate with gemcitabine sensitization (7). Our ﬁndings explain
some of these apparent discrepancies.
We have demonstrated that the mechanistic properties of
effective synergy between gemcitabine and CHK1i are in fact
consistent but contingent on the degree of genotoxicity
induced. This in turn is concentration-sensitive. The salient
features of this modulation are generalized in Fig. 6A. By itself,
low yet synergistic concentrations of gemcitabine retard DNA
synthesis but do not elicit permanent proliferation blockade.
Thus, delayed but timely mitotic CDK1 activation enables cells
to cycle into mitosis. This places a limit on the extent of CDK1
disinhibition and hence checkpoint abrogation when CHK1 is
inhibited. Counterintuitively, at higher gemcitabine concentrations (which by themselves are cytotoxic), the same extent
of CHK1 inhibition triggers unscheduled CDK1 activation and
premature S-phase mitosis. One scenario explaining this phenomenon is the synchronizing effects of high-concentration
gemcitabine. At high concentrations, cells are uniformly and
often irreversibly blocked in S-phase. Addition of CHK1i hence
promotes simultaneous premature mitosis of these arrested
cells, leading to an apparent inﬂation in CDK1 activity and
mitotic index with <4N state. Virtually all functional studies

www.aacrjournals.org

on CHK1i to date that have reported such phenomena base
their conclusions on the higher end (>GI50) of gemcitabine
concentrations, as much as 10 to 200 times above the concentrations where effective synergy is typically observed
(7, 14, 27–29).
We have shown that the immediate response of cells upon
addition of CHK1i to gemcitabine at lower, synergistic concentrations is not premature S-phase mitotic entry. Instead,
cells experience prolonged interphase with enhanced DNA
damage and replication stress, reminiscent of the nucleus-wide
replication catastrophe when ATR signaling is perturbed (30). A
fraction of these cells enter mitosis, often with disastrous
consequences. While this in principle suggests G2 abrogation,
given the global mitotic CDK1 suppression and substantial
delay in mitotic entry as well as the low concentrations of the
agents used, the data are also compatible with the notion of
G2 checkpoint adaptation. It has been shown that G2 adaptation can occur in human cells and is possible following pharmacologic concentrations of genotoxic agents (31, 32). Taken
together, as opposed to blatant checkpoint abrogation, our
study illustrates a "foot-in-the-door" phenomenon (Fig. 6B).
This model proposes that premature S-phase mitotic entry is
not the predominant route to chemosensitization. Instead,
CHK1i synergizes with gemcitabine via a more subtle and
far-reaching mechanism, that is, ﬁrst by engaging cells in
disorderly replication and then committing them to elimination processes that could take place in and beyond mitosis.
Our mechanistic study raises several key issues regarding the
development of CHK1i as cancer therapeutics. First, largely
based on preclinical studies that have used high concentrations
of genotoxic agents, emerging consensus on treatment regimen
advocates a delayed administration of CHK1i (10, 33). However, it is uncertain if any of the enhanced effect seen with a
staggered regimen represents true synergy or if it is a result of
accelerated (but not necessarily synergistic) cytotoxicity. In the
most promising clinical trial so far, 2 patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma exhibited stable disease lasting more than 10
months, and there was a partial response in a patient with
cholangiocarcinoma, in a phase I dose escalation study, when
CHK1i MK-8776 was given only 30 minutes after gemcitabine
(34). We have shown with the aid of mathematical models that
noncytotoxic concentrations of gemcitabine and CHK1i could
yield effective synergy in tumor cells when given together. We
propose that simultaneous administration of both agents warrants further investigation. This is especially germane in view of
the variable intratumoral gemcitabine levels expected in
patients, owing to short half-life and poor drug delivery
(12). Second, dose-dependent toxicities are a major cause of
drug attrition. Clinical development of several checkpoint
kinase inhibitors has been discontinued, the most recent being
AZD7762 given its untoward cardiotoxicity (35). We have
shown that a threshold of CHK1 inhibition beyond that necessary for synergy is required for overt checkpoint abrogation.
As our data suggest that inhibition of S-phase activities of
CHK1 is more relevant to chemosensitization, concurrent
administration of gemcitabine and CHK1i would in principle
obviate the need for G2–M checkpoint abrogation. We anticipate that metronomic gemcitabine, where low doses are given
at frequent intervals, represents an opportunity where the
synergistic interaction between the antimetabolite and CHK1i
could be exploited (36). Third, low doses of gemcitabine and

CHK1i would permit the possibility of triple drug therapies.
This is potentially applicable to treatment modalities to which
S-phase cells are particularly vulnerable, for example, radiotherapy. In support of this and the notion that G2–M bypass is
dispensable for synergy, radiosensitization has been reported to
occur most optimally when CHK1 is inhibited during S-phase,
but not when G2–M abrogation is maximal (37). Attractive
concepts on chemoradiosensitization with checkpoint kinase
inhibitors have been proposed but remain largely unexplored
(10). Our data illustrate a distinct mechanistic perspective on
CHK1 inhibition that serves as a reference for future combination and scheduling work.
