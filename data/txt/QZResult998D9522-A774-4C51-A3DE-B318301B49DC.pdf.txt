Proteotoxic stress targeted therapy (PSTT)
Michael Y. Sherman
while inhibition of proteasome blocks their degradation,
the combination of these treatments could synergistically
precipitate a selective demise of cancer cells. Indeed, it
was demonstrated that downregulation or inhibition of
Hsf1 can potently enhance sensitivity of cancer cells
to Bortezomib [16, 17]. Accordingly, a lot of efforts
and resources have been invested in academic labs and
industry in development of inhibitors of Hsf1 and various
chaperones, but so far there have been no breakthroughs.
The paper by Neznanov et al. [18] offers an
alternative approach towards sensitization of cancer
cells to proteasome inhibitors. Instead of inhibition of
chaperones, this group proposes to cause a buildup of
abnormal polypeptides by heat shock. They demonstrated
that a mild non-toxic heat shock strongly enhances
apoptosis caused by sub-toxic concentrations of
Bortezomib. Although there are no data on the effects
of heat shock beyond cell culture models, an interesting
possibility is that a combination of local hyperthermia and
Bortezomib could be beneficial for treatment of localized
tumors. Furthermore, since only mild heat treatment was
necessary for the synergistic effect with Bortezomib,
there is a possibility that the fever-range temperature,
which could be triggered by pyrogenes can be sufficient
for enhancement of Bortezomib-induced anti-cancer
effects. This possibility opens up a range of approaches
towards treatment.
As an alternative way of generating abnormal
proteins, the authors used puromycin. This inhibitor
accepts growing polypeptide chains, and aborts further
growth, leading to the release of incomplete chains,
which of course cannot fold properly and are toxic. At
low sub-toxic concentrations, puromycin could strongly
potentiate killing of cancer cells by Bortezomib. In
this set of experiments, the authors tested not only cell
culture models, but also a mouse model of multiple
myeloma. They demonstrated that Bortezomib alone
only partially reduced growth of multiple myeloma
tumors transplanted into syngenic animals. On the other
hand, a combination of Bortezomib and low doses of
puromycin led to almost complete inhibition. Overall, the
combination of proteasome inhibitors with puromycin,
heat shock or other treatments that generate a buildup
of abnormal polypeptides represents a novel, and
potentially powerful approach towards cancer treatment.

About a decade ago a multiple myeloma patient
demonstrated a complete response to a proteasome
inhibitor Bortezomib. This case generated a lot of
hopes, and after successful clinical trials Bortezomib
was approved by FDA and became the drug of choice
for this disease. A high sensitivity of multiple myeloma
to proteasome inhibition is probably related to extensive
production immunoglobulins by the cancer cells.
Bortezomib prevents degradation of these proteins, which
accumulate and cause a strong ER stress, eventually
triggering apoptosis [1, 2]. Unfortunately, many patients
show only partial response to Bortezomib, in part due
to the development of resistance [3]. Among multiple
mechanism of resistance to Bortezomib, cells upregulate
expression of molecular chaperones, e.g. Hsp27, which
protect from the buildup of abnormal protein species [47]. The balance between toxicity of abnormal polypeptides
and protective function of chaperones defines the
outcome of the treatment with proteasome inhibitors.
Bortezomib has also been tested in trials for
treatment of solid tumors, either alone or in combination
with other drugs, and results have been promising. The
selective sensitivity of various cancer cells to proteasome
inhibitors as compared to normal cells is probably because
cancer cells have to handle higher levels of abnormal
polypeptides, since they are exposed to adverse conditions
of tumor microenvironments, oxidative stress and because
of genetic instability and associated accumulation of
mutant proteins [8]. Accordingly, cancer cells often have
increased levels of molecular chaperones, like Hsp72 or
Hsp27, as well as the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1
[9]. Furthermore, it was found that cancers have special
requirements for these factors, since Hsf1 and hsp72
knockout mice demonstrate dramatic resistance to certain
types of cancer, e.g. skin or breast cancer [10-12]. These
data led to a concept of the “non-oncogene addiction”
of cancers to Hsf1 and molecular chaperones, and
predicted that inhibition of chaperones could be a potent
novel approach towards development of therapeutics
[8]. In fact, there have been number of publications that
pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated depletion
of Hsf1, Hsp72 or Hsp27 can selectively cause apoptosis
or growth inhibition in various types of cancer [9, 13].
Furthermore, anti-sense RNA against Hsp27 has been
tested and demonstrated promising results with bladder
cancer [14, 15]. Since downregulation of Hsf1 or
chaperones increases the generation of abnormal proteins,
