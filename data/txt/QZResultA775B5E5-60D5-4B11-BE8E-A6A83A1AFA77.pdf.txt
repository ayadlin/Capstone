ABSTRACT
The purpose of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy
and safety of endostar, a recombinant product of endostatin, combined with taxanebased regimens for HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.Women
with ages between 18–70 years with histologically confirmed MBC documented as
HER-2-negative were included. Endostar was administered at 7.5 mg/m2, d1–14,
q21d and was continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, consent
withdrawal, or completion of 24 months of endostar, whichever came first. Taxanebased chemotherapy was continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
consent withdrawal, or up to 8 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall response
rate (ORR). Fifty-seven patients were recruited. The ORRs for the whole population,
first-, second-, and third-line therapy or beyond were 68.4%, 79.3%, 54.5%, and
16.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.8 (8.0–12.1) months, yet the median
OS was still not attained. For the patients receiving first-, second-, and thirdline therapy or beyond, median PFS was 11.9, 7.5, and 7.4 months, respectively
(P=0.048). No significant difference in median PFS between hormonal receptorpositive and -negative patients was observed. The most common drug-related grade
3–4 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (80.7%) and leukopenia (77.2%). Six
(10.5%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia. The most frequent drug-related
grade 3–4 non-hematologic toxicities were liver dysfunction (10.5%) and peripheral
neurotoxicity (8.8%). No treatment-related deaths were reported. We conclude that
Endostar combined with taxane-based regimens may be effective and safe for the
treatment of HER-2-negative MBC. However, further investigations on its long-term
efficacy and toxicity are warranted.

Antiangiogenesis is a promising antitumor strategy
that inhibits tumor vascular formation to suppress tumor
growth. Several antiangiogenic targeting molecules
have been tested and are now used for cancer treat­
ment. However, bevacizumab, as a monoclonal antibody
directed against circulating vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), was removed from MBC indication in
December 2010 based on the poor results of cost-benefit
analysis. In addition, neither sunitinib nor sorafenib,
which are anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), had a major impact in MBC [2]. It is
thus imperative to develop another strategy that inhibits
angiogenesis in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Despite significant improvements in the treatment
of early-stage breast cancer, approximately 20%–40% of
patients develop relapse and distant recurrence, whereas
some present with de novo metastatic disease. The
treatment intent in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients
is primarily noncurative, i.e., palliative, in nature. Overall,
5-year survival rates are reported to approximate 24% [1].
Therefore, treatments that provide more clinical benefit
among these patients, especially the human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-negative subgroup, which
lacks anti-HER-2 therapies, will continue to be sought.

Endostar is a recombinant product of endostatin,
which is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis [3].
Animal studies have shown that endostatin is capable of
blocking the proliferation and organization of endothelial
cells into new blood vessels in vitro and inhibiting
angiogenesis and growth of both primary tumors and
secondary metastasis [3]. Although previous clinical
studies showed that endostatin alone did not result in
significant improvements in cancer progression, it can
be beneficial when combined with other chemotherapies.
A phase III clinical trial on 493 stage IIIB and IV nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients showed
that the addition of endostar to a vinorelbine/cisplatin
regimen resulted in significant and clinically meaningful
improvement in response rate, median time to progression,
and clinical benefit rate compared to the chemotherapeutic
regimen alone [4]. Regarding breast cancer, in vivo studies
showed that the combination of paclitaxel and P125Aendostatin inhibited mammary cancer growth, delayed
the onset of multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas,
decreased tumor angiogenesis, increased the survival of
treated mice in the prevention model, and inhibited lung
and lymph node metastasis in the intervention model [5].
Sun et al. also reported that the tumor-inhibiting effect
of the paclitaxel-cisplatin (TP) regimen combined with
recombinant human endostatin on breast cancer is better
than that of the TP regimen alone in xenograft-bearing
nude mice [6]. Moreover, in a prospective, randomized,
controlled, phase II neoadjuvant trial, the combination
of rh-endostatin with chemotherapy produced a higher
tumor response rate without increasing toxicity in breast
cancer patients [7]. Considering these promising data, this
prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of endostar combined with taxane-based
regimens for HER-2-negative MBC patients.

or beyond were 68.4%, 79.3%, 54.5%, and 16.7%,
respectively. Although not statistically significant
(P=0.542), a numerically higher response rate (78.6%) was
observed in patients who had not received taxanes, either
in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting or metastatic setting,
compared to the 65.1% observed in those pretreated with
taxanes. Objective response was not associated with
hormonal receptor status, visceral involvement, liver
metastasis, lung metastasis, and the number of metastatic
sites (data not shown).
After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the
median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.8 (8.0–
12.1) months, yet the median overall survival (OS) was
still not achieved. The patients not pretreated with taxanes
showed a trend of longer median PFS compared to those
pretreated with taxanes (P=0.058). For the patients
receiving first-, second-, and third-line therapy or beyond,
median PFS was 11.9, 7.5, and 7.4 months, respectively
(P=0.048). No statistically significant difference in median
PFS between hormonal receptor-positive and -negative
patients was observed.

Toxicity
The toxicity profile of the combination treatment
was acceptable and manageable. The most common drugrelated adverse events (AEs) are presented in Table  3.
The most common grade 3–4 hematologic toxicities
were neutropenia (80.7%) and leukopenia (77.2%). Six
(10.5%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia. The
most frequent grade 3–4 non-hematologic toxicities were
liver dysfunction (10.5%) and peripheral neurotoxicity
(8.8%). The endostar-related or -possibly-related AEs
included grade 1–2 arrhythmia (2 patients) and grade 1–2
hypertension (3 patients), which were well controlled with
antiarrhythmic drugs and myocardial nutritional medicine,
and antihypertensives, respectively. No epistaxis and
proteinuria were observed. Dose adjustment due to AEs
was performed on 18 patients (31.6%). No treatmentrelated deaths were reported.

RESULTS
Patients
Between January 2011 and December 2014, 57
patients with invasive ductal carcinoma were recruited.
The characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.
The median age was 50 years (range: 34–69 years).
Fifty (87.7%) patients were hormonal receptor-positive.
Twenty-nine (50.9%) patients had ≥ 3 metastatic organ
sites, and visceral involvement was noted in 48 (84.2%)
patients. Twenty-nine (50.9%) patients had no previous
chemotherapies for metastatic disease.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to
prospectively investigate the efficacy and toxicity of
endostar combined with taxane-based regimens for HER2-negative MBC patients. Actually, as a recombinant
product of endostatin, the antiangiogenesis mechanism
of endostar involves its broad spectrum of activity that is
focused on preventing angiogenesis, including interfering
with TNF-alpha activation of JNK, inhibiting cyclin D1,
blocking FGF signal transduction, and suppressing Ras/
Raf kinases and decreasing ERK-1 and p38 activity
[10–13]. Our results demonstrated an ORR of 68.4% in
patients with HER-2-negative MBC, which met its primary
endpoint, with a 60% ORR for the whole population.

Efficacy
The median number of treatment cycles was 4
(range: 2–8 cycles). Treatment efficacy is summarized
in Table 2. The overall response rates (ORRs) for the
whole population, first-, second-, and third-line therapy

Antiangiogenic approaches represent a promising
new strategy for the treatment of cancer. Although the
VEGF signaling pathway, a well-recognized angiogenic
factor playing a crucial role in regulating tumor
angiogenesis [14] and normal vascular development
[15, 16], is considered as a good antitumor target, the
routine role of bevacizumab in the management of HER2-negative MBC remains controversial. Meta-analysis
has shown that its addition to first-line chemotherapy
in MBC patients is associated with an increase in ORR
and prolonged PFS in three randomized phase III trials,
namely, E2100, AVADO, and RIBBON-1 [17]. Even
in the second-line setting (RIBBON-2), significant
improvements in PFS with bevacizumab were observed
(median 7.2 vs. 5.1 months for chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab vs. chemotherapy alone; P=0.0072) [18].
Although the FDA has removed the MBC indication
from bevacizumab, taxane plus bevacizumab is still
recommended by various guidelines, including the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines, and is continued to be used in clinical practice
especially for those with immediately life-threatening
disease or severe symptoms, thereby suggesting that
antiangiogenic approaches are still considered in breast
cancer treatment and thus deserve further assessment.
In the present study, the ORR and PFS of the 29
patients receiving the combination therapy as first-line
treatment was 79.3% and 11.9 months, respectively,
which were markedly higher than those of chemotherapy
plus bevacizumab in E2100, AVADO, and RIBBON-1
[17] and consistent with the results of a neoadjuvant trial
showing that the ORR significantly increased from 67.7%
to 90.9% when combined with rh-endostatin [7]. Even in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

second- and third-line or more settings, the PFS of this
combination still reached more than 7 months, which
is similar to that reported in RIBBON-2 [18]. Our data
also showed that this combination is effective in patients
pretreated with taxanes, with an ORR of 65.1% and a PFS
of 8.9 months. No statistically significant associations of
ORR or median PFS with hormonal receptor status were
observed, indicating that the combination might be equally
effective between luminal and triple-negative subtypes.
Considering its promising efficacy, this combination
regimen is thus worthy of further investigation in a
randomized phase III study.
With regard to safety, the combination of endostar
with taxane-based regimens did not result in any
significant changes to the AE profile of taxane-based
regimens nor did it increase fatal toxicities. Different
from the observation of increased rates of hypertension
(e.g., in E2100 [14.8%] and RIBBON-1 [8.9%]) and
proteinuria (e.g., in E2100 [3.5%] and RIBBON-1 [3.9%])
in prior studies with bevacizumab [19], the incidence
of hypertension in our study was only 5.3%, and no
proteinuria was detected.
The present study has several limitations. First,
the sample size was relatively small. Second, the study
consisted of a heterogeneous patient population as
patients received endostar combined with taxane-based
regimens in different treatment lines, which resulted
in some uncertainty regarding the treatment effect.
The heterogeneity among different taxane-containing
chemotherapies should also be noted and suggested
that the results be interpreted with caution. However,
these could provide some useful information to design a
randomized study focusing on a determined treatment line

measured. Despite of these limitations, the present study
is the first to reveal the potential efficacy and toxicity of
endostar in MBC.
In conclusion, this pilot clinical trial provides
evidence that endostar enhances the antitumor effects
of taxane-based chemotherapy in MBC patients with
well-tolerated toxicities. Furthermore, the preliminary
results support the setup of a larger sample, multicenter,
randomized, phase III clinical trial to provide a definitive
validation for the use of endostar in future strategy against
HER-2-negative MBC.

end of treatment, radiographic assessment was performed
every 2 months within the first 6 months and every 3
months thereafter until disease progress. Survival status
was assessed every 3 months after disease progress.

Statistical methods

Treatment

The primary endpoint was ORR (CR plus PR).
Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, and safety.
Sample size was calculated on the basis of Simon’s
two-stage minimax design [8]. The ORR of combination
was hypothesized as 65% with the addition of endostar
in the whole HER-2-negative MBC population compared
with 45% for taxane-based regimen [9]. The design had
90% power with a type I error of α=0.05. When 14 of
the first 31 patients enrolled achieved complete response
[CR] or partial response [PR], the study was moved to the
second stage, and when there were 30 out of a total of 54
patients responded to the treatment, the study was deemed
positive and has proven the hypothesis. The sample size
was calculated as 57, which included a 5% dropout rate.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS
version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). PFS was defined as
the interval between inclusion and documented disease
progression, or death as a result of any cause in patients
with no evidence of disease progression. OS was defined
as the interval between inclusion into the study and death.
Safety issues, including incidence and severity of AEs,
were also investigated. PFS and OS were estimated, and
95% confidence intervals were calculated by means of the
Kaplan-Meier method. All P values reported were twosided and were considered significant when <0.05.

Taxane-based chemotherapy choices included
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 qw (12.3%); ABX 130 mg/m2 qw
(43.9%); GT: paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 d1+gemcitabine 1,000
mg/m2 d1d8 q21d (14.0%); or XT: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2
d1+capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 bid d1–14 q21d (29.8%).
Chemotherapy was continued until progressive disease,
unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or up to 8
cycles, whichever came first. Dose modifications were
made if grade 4 neutropenia lasted longer than 3 days,
grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia and/
or grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except alopecia
and inadequately treated nausea/vomiting). In this case,
treatment was interrupted for up to 2 weeks until resolution
to grade ≤ 2, and doses of administered chemo drugs
were reduced permanently by 20%–25% in subsequent
cycles. When the observed toxicity did not resolve after
2 weeks or dose modifications occurred more than twice,
the patient was withdrawn from the study. In addition,
patients who experienced any grade 4 non-hematological
toxicity were withdrawn from the study. Administration of
prophylactic G-CSF was not permitted in the study.
Endostar was administered at 7.5 mg/m2, d1–14, q21d
and was continued until progressive disease, unacceptable
toxicity, consent withdrawal, or completion of 24 months
of endostar, whichever came first. When chemotherapy
was discontinued before progressive disease, the patients
continued treatment with endostar monotherapy. No
reduction in endostar dose was permitted.

Assessment
Pretreatment assessment included a detailed medical
history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and
assessment of performance status. Laboratory evaluation
included a routine blood count, biochemistry including
electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, and urinalysis.
AEs and concomitant medications were recorded at the end
of each cycle throughout the study period until 30 days after
the last dose of a study treatment was administered. Those
AEs assessed by the investigators as “;possibly related” or
“related” to study drug treatment were defined as the “drugrelated AEs”. Toxicity was evaluated and graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for AEs, version 4.0.
Radiographic scans (Computed Tomography scans
or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) for efficacy evaluation
were conducted at baseline and every two treatment cycles
thereafter per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. The best overall
response was reported. For patients without progress at the
