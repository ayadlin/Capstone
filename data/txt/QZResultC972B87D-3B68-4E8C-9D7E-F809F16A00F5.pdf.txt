BACKGROUND. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities (CCA) were detected in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative cells in some patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who attained a cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate. In some
patients, CCA/Ph-negative status was associated with myelodysplasia or acute
myeloid leukemia. The objective of the current study was to determine the prognostic impact of CCA/Ph-negative cells.

METHODS. The authors compared the pretherapeutic risk factors (Kruskall-Wallis test), exposure to
cytotoxic drugs (chi-square test), and overall and progression-free survival (Kaplan-Meyer and logistic
regression analysis, respectively) of 515 patients with mostly chronic-phase CML who were treated
with imatinib mesylate after failure of interferon-a according to whether they attained a major cytogenetic response (MCR) (n 5 324 patients), an MCR with CCA/Ph-negative status (n 5 30 patients),
or no MCR (n 5 161 patients).

RESULTS. CCA/Ph-negative status most frequently involved chromosomes Y, 8, and 7. No significant
differences in pretherapeutic risk factors were detected between patients who attained an MCR with
and without CCA/Ph-negative cells, except that exposure to alkylating agents was more frequent in
patients with CCA/Ph-negative cells, and overall and progression-free survival were identical. With a
median follow-up of 51 months, only 2 patients developed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

CONCLUSIONS. The overall prognosis for patients who had CML with CCA/Ph-negative status was
good and was driven by the CML response to imatinib mesylate. Isolated CCA/Ph-negative cells in
the absence of morphologic evidence of MDS do not justify a change in therapy. Cancer

KEYWORDS: chronic myeloid leukemia, cytogenetic abnormalities, Philadelphia chromosome, BCRABL, imatinib.

I

matinib mesylate has become the standard of care
for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML).1 Greater than 50% of patients with
late chronic-phase CML after failure of interferon-a
(IFN)-based therapy and >80% of newly diagnosed
patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response
(CCR).2 It is believed generally that Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph)-negative hematopoiesis is normal
and is derived from residual nonleukemic hematopoietic stem cells. Unexpectedly, clonal cytogenetic
abnormalities (CCA) were noted in Ph-negative cells
from some patients who had a cytogenetic response
to imatinib. In various studies, the frequency of
patients with CCA in Ph-negative status (CCA/Phnegative) ranged from 2% to 15%.3–6 Although it was
reported initially only in pretreated patients, subsequent case collections also included patients who
received imatinib up-front.7 The majority of the
chromosomal abnormalities observed in these
patients are typical of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and several
patients have developed overt MDS and/or AML.8,9
However, because most of the available data are
derived from case collections without a control
group, the overall prognosis for such patients compared with patients who have CML without CCA/Phnegative cells is unknown, raising difficult management questions for patients who have attained a
major cytogenetic response (MCR) or a CCR to imatinib. To provide prognostic information, we performed a systematic analysis of a large population of

patients with late chronic-phase disease who were
treated with imatinib in a pivotal Phase II study.10

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Cohort
The study CSTI0110, which was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, enrolled 532 patients with CML
who had failed IFN-based therapy.10 In 454 of these
patients, chronic phase was confirmed subsequently,
17 patients had accelerated phase, 12 patients fulfilled criteria for blast crisis (in 11 of 12 patients, this
was based solely on the presence of lymphadenopathy), and 49 patients had missing data. All of these
patients were included in the data review. However,
for the comparison between patient groups according
to cytogenetic response, 17 patients were excluded. In
12 of these patients, either no baseline cytogenetic
results were available, or they were Ph-negative/
BCR-ABL-positive. In 5 additional patients, CCA/Phnegative status could not be confirmed, because the
cytogenetic reports were unavailable for review,
resulting in a cohort of 515 patients. Informed consent was obtained from all patients according to the
Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were treated at an
initial dose of 400 mg imatinib daily. All cytogenetics
database entries between December 1999 and July
2002 were reviewed. On the case report forms (CRFs),
cytogenetic results were captured as 1) the total number of metaphases analyzed, 2) the total number of
Ph-positive metaphases, and 3) additional chromo-

MCR indicates major cytogenetic response; CCA/Ph2, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells; WCC, white blood cell count; BM, bone marrow, PB, peripheral blood.
Results did not differ significantly except for promyelocytes (%) in BM at baseline. Of the 532 patients enrolled, 17 patients were excluded from the current analysis. In 12 patients, no baseline cytogenetic results
were available or the patients were Ph-negative at baseline. In 5 patients, CCA/Ph2 status could not be confirmed because of the lack of cytogenetic reports for review. The results from this analysis did not differ when these patients were included. Because of the skewed nature of the data, the P values reported were based on the Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric version of the analysis of variance).

somal abnormalities. However, entering complete
karyotypes was not required. To identify patients with
CCA/Ph-negative status, we searched the database for
entries of additional chromosomal abnormalities and
then eliminated those reports with 100% Ph-positive
metaphases. Because the accepted definition of a
clonal abnormality is that it is present in at least 2
metaphases, we excluded reports of only a single
metaphase carrying an additional abnormality. For all
remaining patients, copies of the original reports

were requested from the centers for central review.
For patients who had confirmed CCA/Ph-negative
status, additional cytogenetic reports and follow-up
information (including a possible diagnosis of MDS)
were requested and reviewed. For analysis of progression and survival, follow-up data were included up to
the end of July 2005. Progression was defined as progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, loss of
complete hematologic response, loss of MCR, or
death on treatment from any cause.

Statistical Methods
Baseline variables (Table 1) were skewed; therefore,
comparisons between groups were done using the
Kruskal-Wallis test. The frequency of exposure to cytotoxic agents before imatinib therapy in the 3
groups was tabled, and chi-square P values were calculated for the association between exposure to cytotoxic agents and group. The relation between groups
(MCR with CCA/Ph-negative cells, MCR without
CCA/Ph-negative cells, no MCR) and the incidence
of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia
were investigated by univariate logistic regression
analyses. Survival functions for both overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons between groups were done using the log-rank
test. Statistical data analysis was performed using the

groups were performed with and without including
these patients.
In 30 patients (5.8%), CCA/Ph-negative status
was confirmed (Table 2). The median time on imatinib before the first detection of CCA/Ph-negative
cells was 8.6 months (range, 2.8–47 months). The
patients were followed for a median of 51.5 months
(range, 8.6–67.1 months) after the first detection of
CCA/Ph-negative cells. A median of 8 cytogenetic
analyses (range, 0–20 cytogenetic analyses) after the
first detection CCA/Ph-negative cells was reviewed.
The chromosomes most frequently involved were

8 (8 patients; 27%) (Fig. 1). In 6 patients (Patients 3,
10, 16, 17, 18, and 20; 20%), abnormalities were
detected in more than 1 chromosome on at least 1
occasion (Table 3). In 4 of these patients, the
abnormalities occurred in the same clone, sometimes
undergoing evolution, whereas there were 2 independent clones in the remaining 2 patients. Two
patients exhibited the same chromosomal abnormality both in Ph-positive cells and in Ph-negative cells
(2Y in Patient 14 and 18 in Patient 19). In both
patients, Ph-positive metaphases without the additional abnormalities were detected at some point
during follow-up, essentially excluding the possibility
that the abnormalities were acquired before the Ph
status, suggesting that the abnormalities were
acquired independently by the Ph-negative and Phpositive cell clones. In the patient with trisomy 8, it
remains formally possible that the additional copy of
chromosome 8 was lost as part of clonal evolution in
a Ph-positive cell.

Longitudinal Observations
In 4 patients (Patients 1, 2, 23, and 24), the abnormalities in Ph-negative cells were noted only once.

Two of these patients (Patients 1 and 24) had only 1
follow-up karyotype available for review, and the
other 2 patients had 3 follow-up karyotypes each.
The remaining patients showed extremely variable
patterns over time. Several patients had a more or
less rapid rise of abnormal metaphases to 100% of
the Ph-negative cells (Fig. 2) (Patients 7 and 30). The
2 patients with MDS belonged to this category. In
other patients, the proportion of abnormal Ph-negative metaphases remained at a low level throughout
the follow-up period (Fig. 2) (Patients 13 and 20),
whereas other patients had large fluctuations that
seemed to occur at relatively regular intervals (Fig. 2)
(Patients 8 and 14).

Pretherapeutic Disease Features
To determine whether specific pretherapeutic features (age, sex, time from diagnosis, spleen size,
complete blood count parameters, and bone marrow
blasts) were associated with subsequent CCA/Phnegative status, we divided the cohort into 3 groups,
which included 1) patients who attained an MCR
without any CCA/Ph-negative cells, 2) patients who
attained an MCR with CCA/Ph-negative cells, and 3)

ciated parameters, such as bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts, were observed between patients
with and without MCR, consistent with the greater
likelihood that lower risk patients would attain an
MCR,10 whereas no significant differences were observed between patients who attained an MCR with
or without CCA/Ph-negative cells (Table 1). The median time from starting imatinib to achieving MCR
was similar in patients with and without CCA/Phnegative cells (3.27 months vs 5.8 months in patients
without vs with CCA/Ph-negative cells, respectively;
P 5 .48).
In a small group of patients, we previously
reported an association between exposure to cytarabine and idarubicin and CCA/Ph-negative status.8
Thus, we analyzed the 3 groups of patients for exposure to cytotoxic agents before study entry. Because
of the multitude of different drugs used, mechanistically similar agents were grouped together (Table 4).
We were unable to confirm the previously reported
findings but observed that a history of exposure to
alkylating agents was more common in patients with
CCA/Ph-negative status compared with patients who
attained an MCR but had no CCA/Ph-negative cells
(10% vs 1.23%; P 5 .006; odds ratio, 8.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.89–41.78).

nificantly between patients who attained an MCR
with and without CCA/Ph-negative cells; however,
both OS and PFS were significantly shorter in
patients who did not attain an MCR (P < .0001 for
both). The results were comparable when the analysis was limited to patients with confirmed chronicphase disease and were not influenced by the inclusion of the 5 patients who had possible but not
proven CCA/Ph-negative status (data not shown).
Similarly, exclusion of the 8 patients who had loss of
the Y chromosome yielded comparable results with
no difference between patients who achieved an
MCR with and without CCA/Ph-negative status (data
not shown). These results suggest that the prognosis
for patients with CCA/Ph-negative status is similar to

(G-CSF) and transient interruptions of imatinib therapy. The option of an allogeneic transplantation was
evaluated, but no matched donor was identified, and
the patient refused a haploidentical transplantation.
Patient 30 developed monosomy 7 in 3 of 20 metaphase cells approximately 4 years after initiating
imatinib therapy. Trilineage dysplastic changes in the
bone marrow were appreciated first 1 year later, at
which time the monosomy 7 clone comprised 75% of
the metaphase cells and included megaloblastic
eryhtropoiesis, micromegakaryocytes, and a left shift
of the myeloid series without increased blasts. Imatinib was continued. Morphology remained stable
without increased blasts over the subsequent 16
months, but the patient developed progressive pancytopenia and required erythropoietin for anemia
and G-CSF for neutropenia.
In a small, single-center series, we previously
observed grade 3 cytopenias in 5 of 8 patients with
CCA in Ph-negative cells.8 Thus, we compared the
incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia between the 3 groups (Tables 5,
6), but we failed to identify any significant differences, although there was an association between
neutropenia and lack of MCR, in line with published
observations.12,13

Development of MDS and acute leukemia
At a median follow-up of 51 months (range, 3–67
months) after the first detection of CCA/Ph-negative
cells, 2 patients developed MDS, accounting for an
overall incidence of 6.7% in patients with CCA/Phnegative status. Both patients had a rapid and progressive increase in abnormal Ph-negative metaphases to 100%. Patient 3 developed an abnormal
clone that was characterized by inv(1)(p?32.3p?31.2),
del(10)(q24q24) after 12 months on imatinib. Incipient MDS was suspected morphologically at 18
months. At 22 months there was a left-shifted, dysplastic granulopoiesis with 7% blasts; dysplastic
megakaryopoiesis with clusters; and micromegakaryocytes, megaloblastic erythropoiesis, and increased
iron without ringed sideroblasts, consistent overall
with MDS. Imatinib was continued at doses from
300 mg to 400 mg daily. Morphologic and cytogenetic
findings remained largely stable for 47 months after
the first detection of CCA/Ph-negative cells, with
bone marrow blast counts that ranged between 3%
and 10% and with intermittent neutropenia that
responded to granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor

DISCUSSION
The frequency of CCA/Ph-negative status in published case series varies greatly. These discrepancies
may reflect at least in part the different risk profiles
of the cohorts under study, because a considerable
degree of Ph negativity is a prerequisite for detecting
CCA/Ph-negative cells. Thus, we previously reported
a rate of 15.2% in a single-center series of patients
who attained an MCR,8 whereas a rate of 3.4% was
reported in a large, unselected, multicenter cohort.4
The incidence of confirmed CCA/Ph-negative status
in our study was 5.8% (6.8% if the 5 patients with

possible CCA/Ph-negative status but with unavailable
cytogenetic reports were included). Six additional
patients had typical constitutional abnormalities.11
Although karyotypes of nonhematopoietic cells were
not available to prove constitutionality, the findings
that all represent known constitutional abnormalities
and were observed at 100% in all reported karyotypes, including those with Ph-positive metaphases,
strongly suggest that they were not acquired. None
of the 6 patients developed MDS; and, for statistical
analysis, they were not regarded as having CCA/Phnegative status.
Because the cytogenetic abnormalities in patients
with CCA/Ph-negative cells are similar to those associated commonly with MDS or (secondary) AML, it is
important to determine whether the overall prognosis
for patients with CML who have CCA/Ph-negative
status is different from the prognosis for ‘standard’
patients who achieve a similar degree of cytogenetic
response. We observed that the OS and PFS rates did
not differ between patients who attained an MCR
with or without CCA/Ph-negative cells. This implies
that the prognosis for these patients is driven by the
CML response to imatinib rather than by CCA/Phnegative status. Consistent with this finding, there
was no difference between these 2 groups with
respect to pretherapeutic risk factors, whereas the
analysis confirmed previously reported associations

1517

between lack of MCR and certain features of high-risk
disease, such as higher blast counts.14
Only 2 of our patients developed MDS. To our
knowledge, MDS/AML has been reported in at least
14 patients with CCA/Ph-negative status. Chromosomal abnormalities in these patients included
monosomy 7, t(3;21), t(20;21), and other abnormalities,
including multiaberrant karyotypes (Table 7).8,15–20
Given the large number of patients with CML who
are treated with imatinib, the overall incidence of
MDS/AML is low and may be approximately 10% in
the small group of patients who develop CCA/Phnegative status.3 The diagnosis of MDS in this setting
is more difficult, because imatinib itself causes some
dysplasia, including megaloblastic erythropoiesis.5
In addition, many published reports do not fit standard morphological criteria easily. On the basis of
the published data, patients with chromosome
7 abnormalities, particularly monosomy 7, appear to
have the greatest risk of developing MDS/AML. In
fact, 8 of 17 patients with CCA/Ph-negative status
who developed MDS had monosomy 7 (Table 7).
This may justify a more aggressive therapeutic
approach, including stem cell transplantation in eligible patients, even in those patients who do not
(yet) have evidence of MDS. The other extreme of
the spectrum is 2Y. Although 2Y is a common abnormality in older men without evidence of a hematologic disorder, some data suggest that a progressive
rise to >75% of cells is associated with pathology.21
However, to our knowledge, no patient with CCA/Phnegative status and 2Y has developed MDS, suggesting that this is a benign condition, even if the aberrant clone increases in size, like it did in Patient 7
(Fig. 2, top). Similarly, to our knowledge, there has
been only 1 reported case of MDS in a patient with
isolated trisomy 8, which clearly argues that this
finding should not trigger a high-risk therapeutic
intervention.
The etiology of CCA/Ph-negative cells is
unknown. A causative role of imatinib has been suspected,5 but the finding of CCA/Ph-negative cells in
some patients22 who were treated with IFN and the
absence of clastogenic effects in preclinical studies
argues against this possibility.7 However, this recently
was questioned by in vitro studies in fibroblasts that
showed centrosome and chromosomal aberrations in
normal human and animal fibroblasts that were treated with imatinib.23 Because we previously reported
an association between CCA/Ph-negative status and
prior exposure to cytarabine or idarubicin in a small
series of patients who attained an MCR, we retrieved
information on therapy with cytotoxic drugs before
imatinib.8 Although we failed to confirm the associa-

1518

tion with cytarabine and idarubicin, we detected a
higher rate of exposure to alkylating agents (including busulfan) in patients with CCA/Ph-negative
status. This would not be a surprising association,
but its significance cannot be assessed because of
the overall low frequency of exposure to alkylating
agents in the study cohort. Because alkylating agents
are used rarely today in drug therapy for patients
with CML, it will be difficult to confirm this finding
in an independent group of patients. In addition,
CCA/Ph-negative status has been documented in
patients without any significant therapy before imatinib, indicating that, in at least a proportion of
patients, it is not related to therapy.7 Arguably the
most intriguing question is whether CCA/Ph-negative
cells are evidence of a multistep pathogenesis of
CML, with Ph developing as a secondary event, as
been suggested by clonality studies using glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme patterns.24,25
Because, with rare exceptions,26 the specific abnormalities are not demonstrable in both Ph-positive and
Ph-negative cell clones, and there is no evidence for
clonal hematopoiesis in women who attain a CCR
but are not CCA/Ph-negative,8 the data do not readily support this notion. However, this applies only if
it is postulated that the abnormality preceding the
acquisition of Ph endows the target cell with a proliferative advantage, leading to clonal expansion. It
remains possible that an elusive ‘first hit’ generates a
genomically unstable cell, the progeny of which
acquires either Ph or other abnormalities, with the
latter unveiled only by imatinib-induced suppression
of the Ph-positive clone.
In summary, our data suggest that the overall
prognosis for patients who have CML with CCA/Phnegative cells is as good as the prognosis for other
patients who achieve an MCR. CCA/Ph-negative status may justify regular cytogenetic monitoring; however, with the possible exception of chromosome 7
abnormalities, it should not trigger an aggressive
therapeutic approach in the absence of morphologic
evidence of MDS.
