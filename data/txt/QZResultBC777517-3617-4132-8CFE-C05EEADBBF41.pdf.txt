Abstract
The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is required for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and
transcription. Disruption of TFAM results in heart failure and premature aging in mice. But very little is known
about the role of TFAM in cancer development. Here, we report the identification of frequent frameshift
mutations in the coding mononucleotide repeat of TFAM in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and in
primary tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI), but not in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell lines and
tumors. The presence of the TFAM truncating mutation, in CRC cells with MSI, reduced the TFAM protein level
in vivo and in vitro and correlated with mtDNA depletion. Furthermore, forced overexpression of wild-type
TFAM in RKO cells carrying a TFAM truncating mutation suppressed cell proliferation and inhibited RKO cellinduced xenograft tumor growth. Moreover, these cells showed more susceptibility to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis due to an increase of cytochrome b (Cyt b) expression and its release from mitochondria. An
interaction assay between TFAM and the heavy-strand promoter (HSP) of mitochondria revealed that mutant
TFAM exhibited reduced binding to HSP, leading to reduction in Cyt b transcription. Collectively, these data
provide evidence that a high incidence of TFAM truncating mutations leads to mitochondrial copy number
reduction and mitochondrial instability, distinguishing most CRC with MSI from MSS CRC. These mutations
may play an important role in tumorigenesis and cisplatin-induced apoptotic resistance of most microsatelliteunstable CRCs. Cancer Res; 71(8); 2978–87. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancers (CRC) display 2 major types of genomic
instability: chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite
instability (MIN or MSI; 1). CRC exhibiting MSI is characterized by the inactivation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
proteins (2). As a consequence, tumors with MSI accumulate
genetic alterations in both coding and noncoding microsatellite repeats, which are widely distributed throughout the
genome (1, 3). MSI occurs in 90% of cancers in patients with

hereditary nonpolyposis CRC and in 10% to 15% of sporadic
CRC (4). Since the inactivation of an MMR gene by itself is
unlikely to result in a transforming event, additional genetic
changes are believed to be required for cells to become
malignant. In addition to the large number of microsatellite
repeat alterations in noncoding regions that have been
reported in CRC with MSI, many genes with frameshift
mutations in their coding repeats have also been documented.
Examples include TGFBRII, BAX, AXIN2, and HDAC2 (5–9).
Functional analyses of some of these mutants have demonstrated that frameshift mutations can lead to loss of tumor
suppressor function and are probably responsible for driving
tumorigenesis in colonic tissues (6, 9). Therefore, it is critical
to identify the genes carrying frameshift mutations in their
coding repeats and defining their roles in tumorigenesis for an
improved understanding of the etiology of CRC with MSI.
Furthermore, this will provide valuable information for prognostic evaluation and better therapeutic intervention.
On screening for potential mutation targets of deficient
MMR, we identified a coding poly(A)10 repeat in the TFAM
gene. TFAM (also known as mtTF1, mtTFA, or TCF6) is a
mitochondrial transcription factor (10). It regulates mtDNA
transcription and replication, and plays a critical role in
maintaining mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial morphology (10–12). Tfam heterozygous knockout mice exhibited

TFAM Mutation in mtDNA Depletion and Apoptotic Resistance of

a 50% reduction in both Tfam transcription and Tfam protein
levels, resulting in a marked reduction in the mtDNA copy
number (11). TFAM and mtDNA copy number have been
shown to be critical for the regulation of mitochondrial gene
expression; their reduction leads to reduced heart function
and aging (13, 14). Moreover, the depletion of mtDNA and
reduction of TFAM-dependent mtDNA expression are
involved in infantile mitochondrial myopathy, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease (13, 15, 16).
In the present study, we explored the role of TFAM in
colorectal carcinogenesis. We identified a high frequency of
TFAM truncating mutations, showed low level of TFAM
protein and reduced mtDNA copy number in both CRC cell
lines and primary CRC tissues with MSI. We also examined the
effect of the mutant TFAM on tumorigenesis, mitochondrial
gene expression, and cisplatin-induced apoptotic resistance.
Our results indicate that TFAM mutations induce mtDNA
depletion and result in decreased tumor sensitivity to cisplatin
in most CRC with MSI. The presence of these alterations
suggests the potential importance of TFAM in tumorigenesis
of CRC with MSI and implicates TFAM-dependent mitochondrial instability as a unique pathogenetic factor for CRC with
MSI. TFAM mutation may be potentially useful in predicting
outcomes and selecting chemotherapy for patients with
microsatellite-unstable CRC.

Materials and Methods
Tumor tissues and cell lines
Eighty-nine CRC tissue specimens including 43 MSI and 46
MSS collected at Mayo Clinic were previously described (6).
Seventeen CRC cell lines including 11 with MSI (LS174T,
Co115, LoVo, TC7, HCT-15, HCT 116, TC71, SW48, RKO,
HCT-8, and LS411) and 6 MSS (SW480, SW837, COLO205,
SW620, HT-29, and Caco-2), as well as 4 endometrial cancer
cell lines with MSI (HEC-1-A, HEC59, Ishika14, and RL95–2), 1
gastric cancer cell line with MSI (SNU-1), and 4 non-CRC cell
lines (LNCaP, SKBR3, MDA-MB231, and MCF-7) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were
cultured in medium by the standard protocol. Genomic DNA
from tissues or cell lines was isolated using Easy-DNA Kit
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Mutation analysis
PCR was performed using the forward primer in exon 4 of
TFAM: 50 -ATAAAGAAGAGATAAGCAGATT-30 and the reverse
primer in intron 5: 50 -TGCCTATTAAGAGAAAACTAC-30 following the condition previously described (17). Mutations
were determined by direct sequencing analyses of the PCR
products (18). All mutations were confirmed by repeated PCR
amplification and bidirectional sequencing analysis.
Western blotting
The whole cell lysates, cytosol, and mitochondria fractions
were isolated from cells as previously described (19). Western
blot analysis was performed following the protocol described
before (17) using rabbit polyclonal TFAM antibody (20) and
antibodies against Cyt b, cleaved PARP-1, and cleaved Casp-3

www.aacrjournals.org

(Cell Signaling), b-actin and b-tubulin, and the corresponding
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), respectively.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
analyses
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on the 12well chamber slides were incubated with 100 nmol/L
MitoTracker Red CMVRos (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes. Cells
were then washed, fixed, and blocked in 1% bovine serum
albumin–PBS, incubated with primary antibodies and goat
antirabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). Microscopy was performed on LSM510 Carl Ziess
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. For immunohistochemical analysis, tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
and treated in 3% H2O2–methanol to remove endogenous
peroxidase. The sections were then boiled in 10 mmol/L citric
acid buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 minutes for antigen retrieval,
followed by incubation with anti-TFAM antibody (20), biotinylated goat antisera, and streptavidin peroxidase (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). Detection was done using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (Vector Labs). Sections were scored as 0 (, negative), 1 (þ, weak positive), 2 (þþ, medium positive), and 3
(þþþ, strong positive), respectively.
Determination of mtDNA copy number and
mitochondrial mass
The mtDNA copy number was determined by quantitative
real time PCR (qPCR) using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen) on ABI PRISM 7900
Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems; 21). The primer
sequences used were ND1-F1, 50 -CACCCAAGAACAGGGTTTGT-30 and ND1-R1, 50 -TGGCCATGGGATTGTTGTTAA30 for mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1), and
b-actin-F, 50 -TCCCAGCACACTTAACTTAGC-30 and b-actinR, 50 -AGCCACAAGAAACACTCAGG-30 , for b-actin (nuclear
DNA control), respectively. Relative copy number was calculated from the threshold cycle value (Ct value) using the
delta delta Ct (DDCT) method (22). Each reaction was
optimized and confirmed to be linear within an appropriate
concentration range using genomic DNA from a normal
colon epithelial cell line CRL1807. The mitochondrial mass
was determined using flow cytometry. Briefly, 1  106 cells
were labeled with 100 nmol/L MitoTracker Red CMXRos
(M7512, Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium
containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes,
washed and resuspended in 1 mL PBS with 1% FBS. Individual cellular fluorescence signals were analyzed compared
to unstained cells as controls using FACSCalibur and CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences).
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand
cDNA was synthesized by Superscript III First-Strand Kit
(Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was carried out with ABI Prism 7900
using primers: ND1-F2, 50 -TCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGCC-30
and ND1-R2, 50 -AGAAGTAGGGTCTTGGTGAC-30 for ND1;
CYTB-F, 50 -CTATCCATCCTCATCCTAGC-30 and CYTB-R,

50 -TGGTTGTCCTCCGATTCAGG-30 for mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (CYTB), respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control
with primers GAPDH-F, 50 -TCCCAGCACACTTAACTTAGC-30
and GAPDH-R, 50 -AGCCACAAGAAACACTCAGG-30 . Relative
expression levels of ND1 and CYTB were calculated by the
DDCT method as described above.
Constructs, lentivirus preparation, and infection
The full-length wild-type TFAM (Wt-TFAM) cDNA was
PCR-amplified and cloned into pCMV-tag5b expression vector
(Strategene). The mutant TFAM (Mut-TFAM) was created
using the pCMV-tag5b-Wt-TFAM as a template by deleting
1 A in the poly(A)10 region using QuickChange XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the supplier's instructions. Lentiviral constructs expressing Wt- or Mut-TFAM were
generated by inserting the PCR products of the full-length Wtor Mut-TFAM-Myc gene into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP
vector (System Biosciences) with the BamH1/NotI restriction
sites, respectively. To express the GST (glutathione S transferase) fusion proteins of mature Wt- or Mut-TFAM in Escherichia coli, the Wt- or Mut-TFAM without the mitochondrial
target sequence (1–43 amino acid residues) was amplified by
PCR using pCMV-tag5b-Wt- or Mut-TFAM-Myc as templates
and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) with
BamH1/NotI restriction sites. All constructs were verified by
sequencing and immunoblotting. Lentivirus production and
cell infection were performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Separation and analyses of mitochondrial
NP-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions
Mitochondrial NP-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions were
separated and analyzed as previously described (23) with
modification. Briefly, mitochondria (1.0 mg protein/mL) isolated from RKO cells expressing Wt-TFAM-Myc, Mut-TFAMMyc, or control vector were resuspended in TES buffer (10
mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L
EDTA) containing 1 protease inhibitor mix and 0.5% NP40. After incubation (30 minutes on ice) and centrifugation
(20,000  g, 30 minutes, 4 C), samples were separated into a
pellet (P1) and a supernatant (S1). The P1 fractions were
resuspended in mitochondrial lysis buffer, centrifuged (20,000
 g, 30 minutes) and supernatants (S2) were collected. Equal
volumes of S1 or S2 fractions were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE
and detected by immunoblotting using anti-TFAM antibody.
In addition, the mtDNA in P1 and S1 fractions were extracted
(23) and subjected to PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis analysis.
Interaction assay of TFAM protein with mitochondrial
heavy-strand promoter
GST-Wt-TFAM and GST-Mut-TFAM fusion proteins were
generated as previously described (20) and purified using
BugBuster GST Bind Purification Kit following manufacturer's
instruction (Novagen). The mitochondrial heavy-strand promoter (HSP) was generated by annealing 2 complementary
oligonucleotides HSP-F: 50 -CACACACCGCTGCTAACCC-

Briefly, the reactions were performed in 50 mL binding buffer
(20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% NP40) containing 500 nmol/L HSP and 0, 20,

analysis using primers corresponding to the mitochondrial
HSP, hsp-rtF: 50 -CACACACCGCTGCTAAC-30 and hsp-rtR: 50 GGGTGTCTTTGGGGTTT-30 . The levels of protein-bound HSP
were determined by subtracting the unbound HSP.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
For cell proliferation assay, cells infected with Lenti-vector,
-Wt-TFAM, or -Mut-TFAM were seeded in 6-well plates (0.3 
105 cells/well in triplicate) and counted daily for 5 days using a
hemacytometer with trypan blue staining. For apoptosis
analysis, the infected cells were treated with cisplatin (50
mmol/L/mL, 12 hours), followed by propidium iodide staining

Results
TFAM frameshift mutations in primary CRCs and cell
lines
We analyzed the poly(A)10 mononucleotide repeat within
exon 4 of the TFAM gene for mutations in 17 CRCs cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

and 89 CRC tissue specimens. We detected a mutation frequency of 100% (11/11) in CRC cell lines and 74.4% (32/43) in
CRC tissue specimens with MSI. All the mutations displayed a
heterozygous deletion of 1 base in the mononucleotide A
track, except 1 cell line and 4 tissue specimens that displayed
a 2-base deletion (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The TFAM frameshift
mutation was also detected in 3 of 4 endometrial and 1 gastric
cancer cell lines with MSI but not in 6 CRC cell lines and 46
CRC tissue specimens without MSI, nor in DNA isolated from
normal individuals and cancer cell lines without MSI (Table 1
and data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that the
frequent frameshift mutation of the TFAM gene is unique to
microsatellite-unstable cancers, particularly to microsatelliteunstable CRC, distinguishing them from MSS CRC.
TFAM mutation results in reduction in TFAM protein
level
The TFAM frameshift mutation is predicted to result in a
protein truncation at codon 149 (Leu149Stop; D149), leading
to the deletion of the entire region of the second HMG domain
and the tail region (Fig. 1B). To assess the putative effect of the
mutation, we analyzed TFAM levels in 10 CRC cell lines (5 with
MSI and 5 without MSI) by Western blotting using the TFAM
polyclonal antibody. All 5 CRC cell lines with MSI showed
reduced TFAM protein levels as compared to those in the 5
MSS CRC cell lines (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained by
another TFAM antibody (ABCOM, Ab 47517, data not shown).

In agreement with the Western blot data, immunofluorescence analysis showed relatively lower levels of TFAM protein
in CRC cells with MSI than in MSS CRC cells (Fig. 2B). In
addition, cells with reduced TFAM expression exhibited
reduced mitochondrial mass compared to that in MSS CRC
cell lines shown by decreased MitoTracker labeling (Fig. 2B
and C). To examine the above observations in vivo, we
performed immunohistochemical analysis of TFAM in 20
primary CRC specimens. Nine of the 10 CRC with MSI carrying
TFAM mutations showed low levels of TFAM, while all 7 CRC
with MSI carrying no TFAM mutations and 3 MSS CRC
specimens displayed strong levels of TFAM (Fig. 2D). Taken
together, these in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the TFAM
truncating mutation correlates with the reduction in TFAM
protein in most CRC with MSI.

TFAM mutation leads to mtDNA depletion in CRC
Reduction in TFAM protein has been shown to induce
mtDNA depletion in Tfam knockout mice and in cultured
mammalian cells (11, 26). To determine whether this is also
the case in CRC with MSI, we performed qPCR of mtDNA from
17 CRC cell lines, using the ND1 gene as the mtDNA marker
and b-actin as a nuclear control. We first determined the
efficiency and reproducibility of the method using a normal
colon epithelial cell line (CRL-1807) as a control and generated
a standard curve (Supplementary Fig. S1). The results indicated that the mtDNA copy number in 11 CRC cell lines with
MSI was significantly lower than that in the 6 MSS CRC cell
lines (1:2.63, P < 0.01; Fig. 3A, left). Similar results were
obtained on analysis of 4 non-CRC cell lines with MSI
(Table 1) and 5 non-CRC cell lines (LNCaP, SKBR3, RL95-2,

truncating mutation resulting in TFAM protein reduction led
to the decrease in mtDNA copy number in CRC with MSI.
Mut-TFAM promotes tumorigenesis in CRC
To assess the potential role of the mut-TFAM in CRC
tumorigenesis, we performed a cell proliferation assay using
the RKO CRC cell line, which harbors a TFAM truncating
mutation. The growth rates of RKO cells infected with LentiMut-TFAM or Lenti-Wt-TFAM were compared with the
growth rates of RKO cells infected with Lenti-vector. The
expression level of exogenous TFAM (Wt- or Mut-TFAM)
was about 10% of the level of endogenous TFAM and appeared

with Lenti-vector (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). We found
that the cells expressing Mut-TFAM grew faster, while the cells
expressing Wt-TFAM grew slower than the control cells (P <
0.05, Fig. 3B, left). Similar results were observed in the HCT116
CRC cell line, which also harbors a TFAM truncating mutation
(Fig. 3B, right). To determine the cell growth suppression
potential of Wt-TFAM in vivo, we implanted athymic nude
mice with RKO cells expressing the Lenti-vector or Lenti-WtTFAM on the right or left hind flank, respectively. Consistent
with the in vitro cell proliferation data, RKO cells infected with
Wt-TFAM induced much smaller tumors than those induced
by the control RKO cells (Fig. 3C, left). The weight of the
tumors induced by Wt-TFAM was reduced by more than 70%
compared to those induced by control RKO cells (P < 0.01,
Fig. 3C, right). These results suggest that the TFAM truncating

is probably due to the presence of a TFAM truncating
mutation.

Mut-TFAM renders CRC cells resistant to cisplatininduced apoptosis
CRC with MSI exhibits low level of resistance to cisplatin
(27, 28). To explore the role of the TFAM truncating
mutation in cisplatin resistance of CRC with MSI, we
treated Lenti-Wt-TFAM- or Lenti-vector-infected RKO cells
with cisplatin and followed by apoptosis analysis using flow
cytometry. The RKO cells expressing Wt-TFAM were more
susceptible to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, as indicated by
an up to 8-fold increase in sub-G1 stage cells (Fig. 4A) and
an up to 4-fold increase in cytochrome c (Cyt c) levels
before or after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 4B). In agreement
with the Cyt c data, the levels of cleaved Parp-1 and Casp 3
were also increased (Fig. 4B). Since Cyt b is a mitochondrial
gene encoded protein and plays an important role in
apoptosis (29), we further examined Cyt b levels in those
RKO cells. We found that the cytosolic levels of Cyt b and
cleaved Cyt b were higher, while the mitochondrial level of
Cyt b was lower, in RKO cells infected with Wt-TFAM than
in those infected with the control vector (Fig. 4C). These
results suggest that CRC cells harboring the TFAM frameshift mutation are more resistant to cisplatin through a Cyt
b-dependent apoptotic mechanism and that the resistance
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in CRC cells with MSI

Mut-TFAM downregulates Cyt b transcription in CRC
with MSI
To understand the mechanism of Mut-TFAM in the
regulation of Cyt b, we assessed the expression levels of
CYTB and ND1 in RKO cells expressing Wt-TFAM. The
transcriptional levels of both ND1 and CYTB were elevated
significantly (Fig. 5A, P < 0.05). The protein levels of both
ND1 and Cyt b were also elevated (Fig. 5B). Since CYTB is a
mitochondrial gene and TFAM regulates transcription of
mitochondrial genes by binding to the HSP (30), we further
tested our hypothesis that Mut-TFAM might impair the
transcriptional regulation of CYTB by aberrant interaction
with HSP in CRC with MSI. The interaction assay of equivalent amounts of GST-Wt-TFAM or GST-Mut-TFAM synthesized in E. coli with the HSP revealed that the relative
binding ability of Wt-TFAM was significantly higher than
that of Mut-TFAM (Fig. 5C and D, P < 0.01). Moreover, we
found that more Mut-TFAM was present in the NP40-soluble
fraction than Wt-TFAM, while more Wt-TFAM was in the
pellet fraction, where most of the mtDNA was contained
(Fig. 5E). Together, these data suggest that CRC carrying
TFAM truncating mutation may increase resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis through reduced interaction with
HSP and downregulation of CYTB transcription.

Discussion
The mtDNA depletion or mitochondrial instability is a
common event in human cancer, including CRC (31, 32).
However, the cause of mtDNA depletion in tumorigenesis is
currently unknown. In this study, we provided evidence that
mutation in TFAM, an important component of the mitochondrial transcription and replication machinery, plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial stability in CRC. The
mtDNA copy number difference between CRC with or without
MSI is so striking that low mtDNA copy number might be a
potential genetic marker of CRC with MSI, once the current
data are validated in a future large cohort analysis. Besides
CRC, we also observed mtDNA depletion in non-CRC cell lines
with TFAM mutations. However, the range of copy numbers in
non-CRC cell lines without TFAM mutations was wider. Two
breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB231) without
TFAM mutations seemed to have low mtDNA copy numbers,
similar to those in MSI cell lines with TFAM mutations
(Fig. 3A, right). But the exact reason remains unknown and
needs to be determined. Recently, more genes responsible for
maintaining mtDNA stability have been identified, including

www.aacrjournals.org

TIM17 and OXA1 (33). It is possible that loss function mutations or epigenetic regulation of TFAM, TIM17, and OXA1 may
induce mtDNA instability in these non-CRC cells without MSI.
CRC cells with MSI are prone to mutation throughout the
genome. It thus presents a significant challenge to determine
whether a truncating mutation induced by DNA mismatch
repair deficiency functions as a "Driver" to facilitate tumorigenesis or just as a "Bystander". By comparing our data to the
5-point criteria for a bona fide target gene from bystander
mutations proposed by the NCI group, we found that the
TFAM truncating mutations fulfill 4 of the 5 criteria: (i) the
frequency of the TFAM mutation in CRC with MSI is over 75%,
way above that of the background; (ii) mut-TFAM promotes
cell proliferation, suggesting a functional importance in
tumorigenesis; (iii) TFAM interacts with p53 and although
the role of TFAM in the p53 pathway is not defined, the p53
pathway genes are commonly mutated in CRC (34, 35); and (iv)
biallelic inactivation is not applicable since loss of both TFAM
alleles has been reported to be embryonic lethal in mouse and
results in loss of all mitochondria and apoptosis in vivo (11,
36). We noted the prevalence of a 1-base or 2-base deletion
detected in these samples. But when 95 subclones of PCR

products amplified from a CRC tumor DNA with MSI were
sequenced, we did detect low frequencies of 1-base insertion
mutations (3.2%; data not shown). The presence of the low
frequency of 1-base insertion in the tumor specimen harboring 1-base deletion mutation is probably due to the nature of
mitochondrial heteroplasmy (37). Moreover, we did not detect
any meaningful TFAM mutations in CRC cell lines and tumor
specimens without MSI, except for some function-unknown
SNPs (data not shown). The absence of TFAM mutations in
MSS CRC could be due to the small sample size of the current
study or the higher frequency of p53 mutations in MSS CRC
than in CRC with MSI (38). It is, therefore, very likely that
during mutation selection, only TFAM haploinsufficient cells
are selected for tumor growth and the haploinsufficient TFAM
truncating mutation becomes a predominant one during
cancer progression.
Overexpression of Mut-TFAM in promoting cell growth is
evident in both RKO and HCT116 cells by our in vitro cell
proliferation assays. In contrast, Wt-TFAM suppressed cell
growth in these 2 cell lines and in vivo xenograft tumor growth
assays. Intriguingly, overexpression of Mut-TFAM in HEK293
cells induced apoptosis instead of cell growth (data not shown).
This is not surprising since Tfam knockout mouse displayed
massive apoptosis at embryonic day 9.5 and increased apoptosis was observed in the heart of the tissue-specific Tfam
knockouts (39). These data suggest that the involvement of
TFAM in apoptosis is probably temporally regulated and/or
may be tissue specific. It will be necessary to find CRC cell lines
with MSI, which do not carry TFAM truncating mutations to
test whether overexpression of TFAM truncating mutation or
knockdown of TFAM in these cells induces apoptosis. Although
the detailed mechanism by which Mut-TFAM promotes tumor
cell growth remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that loss
of the ability to induce Cyt b expression and thus the inability to
induce Cyt b-dependent apoptosis is probably one of the
mechanisms for Mut-TFAM to induce tumor progression in
most microsatellite-unstable CRC.
Accumulating evidence has indicated that the MMR protein
is critical for cisplatin-dependent apoptosis in many cancer
cells, including CRC, but how loss of MMR protein increases
resistance to cisplatin-dependent apoptosis remains unclear

(27, 40, 41). The results in our study demonstrated that CRC
cells carrying TFAM truncating mutations were more resistant
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis than were the same cells overexpressing Wt-TFAM. These data thus provide evidence that
TFAM is required for the induction of cisplatin-dependent
apoptosis in CRC with MSI. It is critical to initiate an investigation of the responsiveness of CRC patients who carry or do
not carry TFAM truncating mutations to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Such data may help to improve therapeutic intervention protocols for patients with or without TFAM
truncating mutations.
In summary, we have shown the presence of high frequency
of TFAM truncating mutations in human microsatelliteunstable CRC cell lines and primary tumors. The CRC with
MSI harboring the TFAM truncating mutation displayed
impaired mitochondrial stability, dysregulated cell proliferation, mitigated Cyt b-dependent apoptosis, and enhanced
cisplatin-dependent apoptotic resistance. Our preliminary
data also indicate a potential mechanism by which TFAM
truncating mutation is involved in apoptosis through downregulation of Cyt b transcription due to reduced interaction
with mitochondrial HSP. These findings support the role of
TFAM and mitochondrial stability in CRC tumorigenesis. This
may have potential relevance in the pharmacogenetic selection of CRC patients for treatment with cisplatin or other
drugs.
