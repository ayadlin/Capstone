Abstract
Melanoma patients were injected with various vaccines containing a MAGE-A3 peptide presented by HLA-DP4.
Anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells were not detectable in the blood
before vaccination, but their frequencies after vaccination
ranged from 2  106 to 2  103 among the CD4+ blood
T lymphocytes of the patients. The CD4+ blood T lymphocytes
that stained ex vivo with HLA-DP4 tetramers folded with the
MAGE-A3 peptide were selected by flow cytometry and amplified under clonal conditions. About 5% of the CD4 +
T-cell clones that recognized the MAGE-A3.DP4 antigen
had a CD25+ phenotype in the resting state. These CD25+ clones
had a high capacity to suppress the proliferation of another
T-cell clone after peptide stimulation in vitro. Most of them
had high FOXP3 expression in the resting state and an unmethylated FOXP3 intron 1. They produced active transforming
growth factor-B but none of cytokines IFN-;, interleukin-2
(IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. About 20% of CD25 clones had
a significant but lower suppressive activity. Most of the CD25
clonal populations contained cells that expressed FOXP3 in
the resting state, but FOXP3 demethylation was not observed.
We conclude that MAGE-A3.DP4 vaccination can produce
CD4+ T cells that may exert regulatory T-cell function in vivo.

Introduction
The molecular identification of genes encoding tumor-specific
antigens recognized by T cells has led to attempts to immunize
cancer patients against these antigens (1–3). Cancer germline gene
MAGE-A3 is expressed in 76% of metastatic melanoma and in many
other tumors of various histologic types. It encodes several
antigenic peptides that bind to HLA class I or class II molecules
and are recognized by T lymphocytes on tumor cells (4–8).
The clinical response rate of tumor-bearing patients vaccinated
with MAGE antigens has been low. About 8% of the melanoma
patients, who were immunized with the MAGE-A3168-176 antigen
presented by HLA-A1, showed complete or partial clinical

responses according to WHO criteria and an additional 8% showed
some evidence of tumor regression, usually mixed responses.
Clinical responses were observed at a similar rate in patients
vaccinated with this peptide either alone or mixed with adjuvant,
dendritic cells loaded with the peptide, or an ALVAC poxvirus
encoding this peptide (9–11).
The low rate of clinical responses obtained with these vaccines
led us to test whether providing help to the CD8+ T-cell response
by vaccinating also with MAGE-A3 antigens recognized by CD4+
T cells would increase efficacy. One way to immunize with
MAGE-A3 antigens recognized by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
was to use the MAGE-A3 protein as a vaccine. Melanoma-bearing
patients vaccinated with the protein did not show improved clinical
responses relative to those obtained with peptide MAGE-A3.A1 (12–
14). It is noteworthy that a vaccine containing protein MAGE-A3,
which was injected in patients with completely resected non–small
cell lung cancer, conferred a significant reduction in recurrences
(15, 16). No such adjuvant study has been completed with the
MAGE-A3.A1 peptide, so that comparison of efficacy is not possible.
Another way to elicit both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against
MAGE-A3 was to use the MAGE-A3243-258 peptide presented by
HLA-DP4 in addition to tumor-specific peptides recognized by
CD8+ T cells. This approach did not result in improved clinical
responses of melanoma-bearing patients, as f5% of the patients
showed complete or partial clinical responses.5
Considering that the use of MAGE-A3 antigens recognized on HLA
class II molecules did not bring about a significant improvement in
clinical responses, we wondered whether a CD4+ T-cell response
against these antigens had been raised. The analysis of the response
raised by protein MAGE-A3 was hampered by the multiplicity of
potential antigens. We, therefore, focused on the response of patients
who had received the MAGE-A3.DP4 peptide. Our approach involved
the ex vivo selection of CD4+ T cells that are labeled by DP4 MAGEA3 tetramer (17). We observed frequencies of anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T
cells that are similar to those observed for the MAGE-A3.A1 antigen.
We also observed that f5% of the anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells
seemed to be regulatory T (Treg) cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, media, and reagents. Stimulator EBV-B cells were
derived from DP4+DR1+ patient DDHK2. Feeder EBV-B cells were derived
from patient LG2. These cell lines were cultured in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
FCS (Perbio), L-arginine (0.55 mmol/L), L-asparagine (0.24 mmol/L),
L-glutamine (1.5 mmol/L) (AAG), penicilin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin

(100 Ag/mL). DDHK2-EBV cell line expressing Ii-MAGE-A3 was described
previously (18). T cells were cultured in IMDM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% human serum, AAG, antibiotics, h-mercaptoethanol
(50 Amol/L), and methyl-tryptophane (200 Amol/L) (complete medium).
Human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was purchased from Chiron
Healthcare SAS, IL-7 from R&D Systems, and PHA (HA16) from Murex.
Human recombinant IL-4 was produced in our laboratory.
Ex vivo sorting and culture of CD4+ T-cell clones. The production of
soluble fluorescent DP4/MAGE-A3 tetramers was described previously (17).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinated patients were
thawed and incubated overnight at 37jC at 4  106 cells/mL in complete
medium in the presence of DNase (5 units/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Labeling
with 100 nmol/L of the DP4/MAGE-A3 tetramers conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) was described previously (17). Anti–CD4-FITC (1:50, RPA-T4, BD
Pharmingen) and anti–CD8-PeCy5 (1:50, RPA-T8, BD Pharmingen) antibodies were subsequently added to the cells for 10 min at room
temperature. Living CD4+CD8 tetramer+ cells were selected by flow
cytometry on a FACSVantage (BD Biosciences) and distributed at one per
well in U-bottomed 96-well plates. Cells were stimulated in complete
medium with irradiated DP4+ DDHK2-EBV cells (3  104 per well),
previously pulsed for 2 h at 37jC with 5 Ag/mL of MAGE-A3.DP4 peptide
KKLLTQHFVQENYLEY and washed, in the presence of IL-2 (160 IU/mL),
IL-7 (10 ng/mL), IL-4 (5 IU/mL), and PHA (125 ng/mL). In each well, 3  104
irradiated allogeneic LG2-EBV cells were added as feeder cells. After three
weekly stimulations, cells that proliferated were incubated with 50 nmol/L
of the DP4/MAGE-A3 tetramers conjugated to PE. Anti–CD4-FITC (1:20)
antibody was subsequently added to the cells for 10 min at room
temperature. Analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences)
and CellQuest software. Anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clones (5  105 cells) were
restimulated every 2 wk in 24-well plates, in 2 mL of complete medium in
the presence of IL-2 (160 IU/mL), IL-7 (5 ng/mL), and 1  106 irradiated
allogeneic LG2-EBV feeder cells. Stimulators were 2  105 irradiated
allogenic DDHK2-EBV.Ii-MAGE-A3 cells. For long-term cultures, some
clones were also stimulated every 2 wk in 2 mL of complete medium with
anti-CD3 antibody (1 Ag/mL; OKT3, Janssen-Cilag) in the presence of IL-2
(1,000 IU/mL), IL-7 (10 ng/mL), and irradiated feeder cells (2  106
allogeneic PBMCs and 1  106 LG2-EBV cells). Clones J1 and M1 were
described in Stockis and colleagues (19) under the name TregD1 and
TregC2, respectively.
Isolation of CD25+ and CD25 blood cells. Peripheral blood samples
were obtained from hemochromatosis blood donors. CD4+CD25+ and
CD25 cells were isolated using the CD4+CD25+ regulatory isolation kit
(Miltenyi Biotech).
CD25 expression. A total of 25,000 cells of each clone, collected at least
11 d after the last stimulation, were either analyzed in the resting state or
after 40 h of coculture with 75,000 irradiated DDHK2-EBV.Ii-MAGE-A3
cells in the presence of 160 IU/mL IL-2. Cells were labeled with anti–CD3FITC (1:20, clone UCHT1, BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD25 (either labeled
with PE or APC, 1:20, M-A251, BD Pharmingen) or with control isotypematched mouse IgG1 antibodies (IgG1-PE, X40, BD Pharmingen or IgG1APC, MOPC-21, BD Pharmingen).
Cytokine secretion assay. After cloning procedure, the clones were
tested at least 2 wk after the last antigenic stimulation. In total, 5,000 cells of
each clone were stimulated with 2  104 DDHK2-EBV-B.Ii-MAGE-A3 or
with untransduced cells as control. After 20 h of coculture in roundbottomed 96-well plates in 200 AL of complete medium (duplicates), IFN-g,
IL-2, and IL-10 released in the supernatant were measured by ELISA using
Cytoset reagents from Biosource. For IL-4, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a), five CD25+ and 20 CD25 clones were analyzed as follows: 25,000
cells of each clone were stimulated with 25,000 DDHK2-EBV pulsed
(or not) with peptide MAGE-A3.DP4 (5 Ag/mL). After 20 h of coculture in
round-bottomed 96-well plates with 200 AL/well complete medium,
cytokines were measured using the cytometric bead array kit Th1/Th2
(BD Pharmingen) or the Bio-Plex human cytokine assay (Bio-Rad).
In vitro suppression assay. Twenty-five thousand cells from CD4+ clone
DDHK2 569 F4.3 (18), used as indicator cells, were labeled with 2 Amol/L of
fluorescent membrane labeling molecule PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells of

each anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clone (25,000) were labeled with 2 Amol/L of
fluorescent membrane labeling molecule PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
added in the microwells. Irradiated DDHK2-EBV cells (25,000) pulsed with
5 Ag/mL of the corresponding peptide were added as stimulator cells. The
cocultures were performed in 200 AL in four microwells with 30 IU/mL of
IL-2. On days 0, 1, 3, and 4, cells were collected from one microwell, labeled
with CD3-APC (1:20, UCHT1, BD Pharmingen), and CD25-PECy7 (1:20, 2A3,
BD Pharmingen), and resuspended with fluorescent beads (Fluoresbrite
Plain YG6, Polysciences). The number of living CD3+ PKH67+ cells and the
number of fluorescent beads acquired during the analysis were used to
calculate the number of indicator cells in the coculture. Analysis was
performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed
with CellQuest software or FlowJo software. A suppression assay was
considered valid if >90% of the indicator cells cultured alone expressed
CD25 on day 1, and if indicator cells had proliferated at least by a factor of
z2. Anti–transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) antibody MAB 1835 was
purchased from R&D Systems.
FOXP3 expression. Cells were collected at least 11 d after the last
stimulation. Total RNAs were prepared from 1 to 4  104 cells with RNA
isolation kit (Gentra Systems) and reverse transcribed with MMLV-RT
(Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 AL
with 0.6 units of HotGoldStar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec), 0.25 units of
Uracil N-Glycosylase (Eurogentec), 300 nmol/L of each primer, 100 mmol/L
of probe, 200 Amol/L of deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 5 mmol/L of
MgCl2 and run on an ABIPrism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems)
under standard conditions: 94jC for 10 min, 40 cycles of 94jC for 15 s, and
60jC for 1 min. The following primers were used (5¶ to 3¶ sense, antisense, and
probe, respectively):
EF-1, GCTTCACTGCTCAGGTGAT, GCCGTGTGGCAATCCAAT,
FAM-AAATAAGCGCCGGCTATGCCCCTG-TAMRA;
FOXP3 TTTCACCTACGCCACGCTCA, CCAGCTCATCCACGGTCCA,
FAM-CCACCTGGAAGAACGCCATCCGC-TAMRA.
Detection of FOXP3 protein. We tested two anti-FOXP3 antibodies.
Cells in the resting state, i.e., at least 11 d after the last stimulation,
were stained for surface CD3 (anti–CD3-PE, 1:20, UCHT1, BD Pharmingen), then fixed, and permeabilized for 1 h at 4jC. After a blocking
step with 2% rat serum for 15 min, cells were stained for 40 min with
anti–FOXP3-Alexa488 as described by the manufacturer (2.5 Ag/mL,
PCH101, eBioscience) and histone H1-Alexa 647 (2.5 Ag/mL, AE-4,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control isotype-matched antibodies (rat
IgG2a-Alexa488, eBR2a, eBioscience; mIgG2a-Alexa 647, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Alternatively, resting cells were stained for surface CD3
(anti–CD3-FITC, 1:20, UCHT1, BD Pharmingen), then fixed, and
permeabilized for 18 h at 4jC. After a blocking step with 5% mouse
serum for 15 min, cells were stained for 2 h with anti–FOXP3-PE
(2.5 Ag/mL, 236A/E7, eBioscience) and histone H1-Alexa 647 (2.5 Ag/mL,
AE-4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control isotype-matched mouse
antibodies (IgG1-PE, P3, eBioscience; IgG2a-Alexa 647, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Analysis of the methylation pattern of FOXP3. DNAs extracted from
T cells were treated with bisulfite. The methylation status was analyzed
by real-time PCR using primers specific for the methylated or the
unmethylated form of intron 1, as described in Stockis and colleagues
(19). The results are expressed as percentages of unmethylated FOXP3
sequences, calculated as follows: % unmethylated = 2DCt/(1 + 2DCt), wherein
2DCt = (Ct with methylated primers)  (Ct with unmethylated primers).
SOX4 and ID3 expression. Cells were seeded in microwells coated
with anti-CD3 (1 Ag/mL, OKT3, Janssen-Cilag) in the presence of soluble
anti-CD28 (1 Ag/mL, BD Pharmingen). Cells were collected in the resting
state and 2, 6, and 24 h after stimulation. PCR amplifications and primers
for SOX4 and ID3 were already described (19).
Detection of PhosphoSMAD2 by Western blot. Cells were stimulated
with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, as described above, and collected
24 h after stimulation. Cell pellets were prepared, and membranes were
hybridized as previously described (19).

*Tumor response was defined according to the WHO criteria. NED, no evidence of disease; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease; MR, mixed
response, i.e., regression of some target lesions whereas others remain stable, progress, or appear simultaneously ( formally classified as stable or
progressive disease in the WHO classification).
cBlood cells were collected before immunization (Pre) and at different time points after vaccinations (Post).
bThe frequencies were calculated as described in Fig. 1. If no clone was derived, we indicated in the table that the frequency was lower than the total
number of CD4+ blood T lymphocytes that passed through the flow cytometer.
xIFN-g produced in the supernatant of cocultures was estimated by ELISA. If 25,000 antigen-stimulated T cells released >50 pg of IFN-g, the clone was
considered IFN-g positive.
kPatients were injected i.m. with 300 Ag of MAGE-A3 protein mixed with the immunological adjuvant AS-15 (GlaxoSmithKline) injected at a single
intramuscular site. They also received without adjuvant a minimum of one and a maximum of three peptides i.d. (60 Ag) and s.c. (240 Ag) at sites close
to the protein/adjuvant injection site. Peptides were selected according to the patient’s HLA type and tumor antigen expression within the following set
of peptides: MAGE-A3.DP4, MAGE-A3.A1/B35, NA17.A2, MAGE-A10.A2, MAGE-A3.A24, MAGE-A3.B44/B18, MAGE-A12.Cw7, and MAGE-A3.DR13.
Patients LB2673 and EB124 received six injections every 3 wk and three injections every 6 wk. Patients IRCL 22, EB97, NAP41, and NAP42 received six
injections every 3 wk. This clinical trial LUD 02-002 was performed at the Université Catholique de Louvain.
{The vaccine was described in Schuler-Thurner and colleagues (32). Briefly, mature dendritic cells loaded with several HLA class I and class II peptides
were given s.c. every 2 wk for the first five injections and then monthly.
**The mature dendritic cells were prepared as described in Tuyaerts and colleagues (49). Patient LB2586 was injected with >6  106 dendritic cells
loaded with MAGE-A3.DP4 and MAGE-A3.A1 peptides. She received two injections (50% i.d. and 50% s.c.) every 2 wk, seven injections monthly, and then
two injections every 2 mo. This clinical trial VUB 02-001 was performed at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
ccCD25+ clone C3, unlike the other CD25+ clones, had methylated FOXP3 sequences (Table 2).
bbPatients were injected with 300 Ag/mL of peptide MAGE-A3.DP4, KKLLTQHFVQENYLEY, and peptide MAGE-A3.A1, EVDPIGHLY (50% i.d. and 50%
s.c.). Patient NW1509 received nine injections at 10 to 11 d of intervals, then six injections every 2 wk, and three injections every 4 wk. Patient LB2643
received nine injections every 10 to 11 da and two injections every 2 wk. This clinical trial LUD 97-002 was performed at the Université Catholique de
Louvain.
xxThe mature dendritic cells were prepared as described in Tuyaerts and colleagues (49). Patients were injected (50% i.d. and 50% s.c.) with 4 to 6  106
dendritic cells loaded with MAGE-A3.DP4 and 8 HLA-A2 peptides (MAGE-A1.A2, MAGE-C2.A2, MAGE-A3.A2, MAGE-A4.A2, MAGE-A10.A2, NA17.A2,
Tyrosinase.A2, NY-ESO-1.A2). Patient VUB78 received four injections every 2 wk. Patient LB2760 received six injections every 2 wk. This clinical trial VUB

Figure 1. Example of the procedure
used to obtain anti–MAGE-A3.DP4
T cell clones from blood cells of vaccinated
patients. The numbers indicated
correspond to an experiment performed
with blood cells of patient EB97 collected
after the sixth vaccination. The tetramer+
clones were tested for their ability to
release cytokines upon antigenic
stimulation. In total, 5,000 T cells
were cocultured with 20,000
MAGE-A3–expresssing cells in 0.2 mL.
The concentration of the cytokines IFN-g,
IL-2, and IL-10 produced in the overnight
supernatant was estimated by ELISA. If
T cells released <50 pg/mL of any of the
three cytokines, the clone was considered
cytokine-negative and subsequently tested
for up-regulation of activation marker
CD25; 25,000 T cells, collected at least
12 d after the last stimulation, were
cocultured with 75,000 DP4 MAGE-A3+
EBV-B cells or DP4 control EBV-B cells, in
the presence of 160 IU/mL of IL-2. Cells
were collected after 40 h, labeled with
CD25-PE, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cells cultured without stimulator cells had a
similar CD25 expression compared with
cells cultured with control EBV-B cells.
The geometric mean of the fluorescence
of the cells labeled with the control
isotype-matched antibody was set at 5.

Results
Frequencies of anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells in vaccinated
cancer patients. We analyzed the blood T cells from 14 vaccinated
melanoma patients who carried the HLA-DP4 allele and whose
tumor expressed MAGE-A3 (Table 1). Thirteen were tumor-bearing,
whereas one had no evidence of disease at the time of vaccination.
The vaccines involved various antigens present on melanoma cells,
and all contained the MAGE-A3243-258 peptide presented to T cells
by HLA-DP4. They were either a mix of peptides without adjuvant,
autologous mature dendritic cells loaded with peptides or a MAGEA3 protein mixed with adjuvant and combined with peptides
(Table 1). Of the 13 tumor-bearing patients, four experienced a
mixed response after vaccination; three had a stable disease for 3, 4,
or 5 months; and six had a progressive disease.
The procedure used to isolate ex vivo anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells
is outlined in Fig. 1 and was used with the 23 blood samples
indicated in Table 1. Tetramer+ CD8 CD4+ cells were selected by
flow cytometry, distributed at one cell per microwell, and

Proliferating clones were screened with the tetramer.

A total of 197 tetramer+ stable clones were isolated from 10 of
the 14 patients. To confirm that the tetramer+ clones recognized
DP4 cells expressing MAGE-A3, we tested them for their ability to
produce cytokines IFN-g, IL-2, and IL-10 upon stimulation. The
stimulators were cells from an immortalized B-cell line transduced
with a retrovirus coding for a MAGE-A3 protein fused to a truncated invariant chain. This targets MAGE-A3 to endosomal
compartments, resulting in presentation by HLA class II proteins
(6). Among the 197 tetramer+ clones, 160 produced at least one of
the three cytokines. To obtain evidence that the other 37 also
responded to the MAGE-A3.DP4 antigen, these clones were tested
for up-regulation of marker CD25 upon stimulation. All of them
scored positive. Interestingly, some clones already expressed CD25
in the resting state, i.e., at least 11 days after the last stimulation.
Their CD25 expression further increased 2-fold to 10-fold upon
contact with DP4 MAGE-A3+ cells (Fig. 1). We concluded that each
of the 197 tetramer+ CD4+ T-cell clones recognized the MAGEA3.DP4 antigen.
The frequencies of such anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells among the
blood CD4+ T cells were calculated by multiplying the fraction of

the CD4+ T cells selected as tetramer+ in the flow cytometer on
the day of sorting with the fraction of cloned cells that yielded
anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clones (Fig. 1).
Anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 cells were found in one of two patients
injected with a mix of peptides without adjuvant, in three of

six patients injected with peptide-loaded dendritic cells, and in
each of the six patients injected with a MAGE-A3 protein
mixed with adjuvant and peptides (Table 1). When the postvaccination sample was found to contain anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T
cells, a blood sample collected before vaccination was tested, if

J, F, C, etc., described in Tables 1 and 2. The anti–MAGE-A3.DR1 indicator cells were stimulated with DR1+ EBV-B cells pulsed with the MAGE-A3.DR1
peptide, as described in A. If indicated, anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 cells were added together with DP4+ cells, which were pulsed or not with the MAGE-A3.DP4 peptide.
Anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 cells were analyzed at least 11 d after the last stimulation for their ability to suppress the proliferation of anti–MAGE-A3.DR1 clone. We considered
that, 11 d after the last stimulation, T cells were in a resting state characterized by very low HLA-DR expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S4). The suppressive
activity of clone J1 necessitated a close proximity between the suppressive cells and the indicator cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). C, points, averages of eight
independent assays performed within a 10-month period; bars, SD. Clones F1 and C1, which had no suppressive activity, proliferated whereas proliferation of

These results are very similar to those we observed with CD8 T-cell
responses. They contrast with several results obtained with
ELISPOT that showed ample frequency fluctuations between
different time points (20, 21). We found no correlation between
the frequencies of anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cells and the clinical
evolution of the patients, but the very small number of patients and
the diversity of the vaccines preclude any conclusion.
Presence of T cells with suppressive activity. As mentioned
above, some clones expressed CD25 in the resting state. Among the
197 anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell clones, 12 clones isolated from five
patients expressed CD25 when at rest (one example in Fig. 1). This
CD4+CD25+ phenotype at rest was evocative of T cells with
suppressive activity, known as Treg cells (22). This led us to
examine a set of CD25+ and CD25 clones for their ability to
suppress the proliferation of other T cells.
In the usual assays for suppressive activity on proliferation, the
potential Treg cells are mixed with CD4+CD25 blood cells, which
served as indicators of suppression, and both cell types are
activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (22, 23). Because
the peptide recognized by our anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T cell clones was
known, we designed an assay where a DR1+-restricted indicator Tcell clone, stimulated with peptide-pulsed DR1+ EBV-B cells, was
cocultured with potential anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 Treg cells, which
were stimulated with peptide-pulsed DP4+ EBV-B cells (Fig. 2A).
The test was performed in the presence of IL-2. To measure
indicator cell numbers by flow cytometry, the two cell types in
the coculture were labeled with different fluorescent membrane
markers. Number of indicator cells after 3 and 4 days of culture, in
the presence or in the absence of potential Treg cells, were

compared (Fig. 2A). An example of one experiment with suppressor
clone J1 and two clones without suppressive activity is shown in
Fig. 2B. The suppressive activity of clone J1 required antigenic
stimulation, because J1 cells incubated with DP4+ cells that were
not pulsed with the MAGE-A3.DP4 peptide had no suppressive
activity (Fig. 2B). The Fig. 2C compiled data obtained with
suppressor clone J1 and nonsuppressor clones C1 and F1 in
eight independent suppression assays that were performed within a
10-month period. Using this suppression assay, the suppressive
activity of 5 CD25+ clones and 20 CD25 clones was tested
(Fig. 2D). Suppressive activities ranged continuously from 0 to 57%
inhibition of proliferation (Table 2). The five clones that expressed
CD25 at rest had the highest suppressive activity (Fig. 2D). But a
number of CD25 clones also had a significant suppressive activity,
albeit lower.
We tested the ability of anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clones J1, C1, F1 to
suppress the release of cytokines by blood CD3+CD4+CD25 cells,
in an assay similar to previously reported assays (24, 25).
Suppressor clone J1 suppressed >80% of IFN-g release. It suppressed also the release of IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-2 much more
efficiently than clones C1 and F1 (Supplementary Table S1).
Noteworthy, the apparent decreased cytokine release could be
partially due to degradation or consumption of cytokines. We
tested also the ability of clone J1 to suppress the release of
cytokines by DR1+-restricted indicator cells but did not observe
suppression (data not shown), possibly because cytokine release is
easier to suppress with blood cells containing a large number of
naive cells than with cells from a clonal population stimulated
every 2 weeks.

Figure 3. Expression of FOXP3 by anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clones. The code names correspond to T-cell clones isolated from patients C, F, I, etc., described in
Tables 1 and 2. The percentages of suppression were calculated as described in Fig. 2A. A, RNAs were extracted from anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 clones collected at least
11 d after the last stimulation. FOXP3 expression was estimated by quantitative real-time PCR and was normalized to EF-1 expression. We estimated that one
T cell contains f103 cDNA copies of EF-1. B, cells were labeled with anti-FOXP3-PE antibody 236A/E7 or control isotype-matched antibody. Because some clonal
populations had a heterogeneous FOXP3 staining, the nucleus permeabilization was checked by labeling with anti–histone H1 antibody (data not shown). FOXP3+
cells are indicated as the percentage of cells having a fluorescence intensity of >99% of the cells labeled with the control isotype-matched antibody. The fluorescence
intensity of the FOXP3+ cells is estimated by subtracting the geometric mean of the control isotype-matched antibody from the geometric mean of FOXP3+ cells.
FOXP3 protein is expressed as the percentage of FOXP3+ cells multiplied by the fluorescence intensity of the FOXP3+ cells. Clones C3 and C4 were clonal populations,
which each express a single TCRh rearrangement and a single CDR3 sequence. C, methylation status of FOXP3 intron 1: DNAs extracted from T cells were
treated with bisulfite, and the methylation status was analyzed by quantitative PCR using primers specific for the methylated or the unmethylated form of intron 1. The
results are expressed as percentages of unmethylated FOXP3 sequences. Because one copy of FOXP3 is inactivated by methylation in female somatic cells, the
percentages of unmethylated FOXP3 sequences of the samples obtained from females were multiplied by 2.

Expression of FOXP3 and cytokines. In mice, CD4+CD25+ Treg
cells constitutively express the gene coding for transcription factor
Foxp3, whereas the other T cells do not (26–28). In humans, the
expression of FOXP3 is not restricted to Treg cells, as the gene is
transiently expressed in blood CD4+CD25 T cells upon activation
(29). We analyzed the expression of gene FOXP3 by quantitative
PCR in the 25 above-mentioned anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell clones.
These clones were analyzed in the resting state, i.e., at least 11 days
after stimulation. The expression of gene FOXP3 by the different
clones ranged continuously from 0 to 35 mRNA copies per cell
(Table 2). FOXP3 was expressed in all CD25+ clones but also in
some CD25 clones. The amounts of FOXP3 mRNA present in
CD25+ clones were similar to those found in CD4+CD25+ blood
T cells.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

As mentioned above, the five CD25+ clones had the highest
suppressive activity. The four clones that expressed the highest
amount of FOXP3 mRNA secreted upon stimulation small amounts
of TNF-a but no IFN-g, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, or IL-10 (Table 2). The fifth
CD25+ clone, C3, showed a different profile. Although its
suppressive activity seemed to be as high as that of the other
clones, it expressed significantly less FOXP3 mRNA and produced
small amounts of IL-4 and IL-5. Among the four CD25 clones that
exerted the highest suppressive activity, only clone J2 had a high
amount of FOXP3 (Table 2; Fig. 3A). Some of the CD25 clones,
exerting little or no suppressive activity, such as C4 and I1, also had
a significant expression of FOXP3 (Table 2).
To detect protein FOXP3, we used antibody 236A/E7, because we
and others have observed that the widely used staining protocol

involving antibody PCH101 gave false-positive results (ref. 30;
Supplementary Fig. S2). To estimate the amount of protein present
in each T-cell clone, we took into account both the fraction
of FOXP3+ cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of the
FOXP3+ cells (Table 2). There was a good correlation between
the amounts of FOXP3 mRNA and protein present in each T-cell
clone (Supplementary Fig. S3). The presence of FOXP3 protein is

not restricted to the CD4+ T cells exerting a suppressive activity
(Table 2; Fig. 3B). However, the four CD25+ T cells mentioned above
had the highest FOXP3 content and had the highest suppressive
activity.
Stable and high FOXP3 expression in human CD4+CD25+ T cells
was recently shown to be linked to an unmethylated status of CpGs
located in a region of intron 1 (31). In contrast, these CpGs are

methylated in other CD4+ T cells and remain so after activation,
although FOXP3 expression is induced. The methylation status
of the intron 1 of the FOXP3 gene can be analyzed by treating
the DNAs with sodium bisulfite followed by alkali to convert the
unmethylated cytosines into uracil and by applying quantitative
PCR with primers specific for the converted sequences derived
from the methylated and the unmethylated sequences (19). The
methylation status of 18 of our clones was tested, in particular the
clones that expressed at least 10 copies of FOXP3 mRNA per cell.
Only the four CD25+ T cells mentioned above, with the highest
suppressive activity, the highest FOXP3 expression, and no cytokine
production, had unmethylated FOXP3 sequences (Table 2; Fig. 3C).
Of the total of 197 anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell clones, 12
expressed CD25 at rest and 11 of them had an unmethylated
FOXP3 gene (Table 2; data not shown). This common epigenetic
signature suggests that these clones share a common developmental origin, distinct from that of other CD4+ T cells. These 11 clones,
isolated from four different patients, secreted upon stimulation
small amounts of TNF-a but no IFN-g, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 or IL-10 (data
not shown). Although these four patients had been injected with
protein MAGE-A3 mixed with adjuvant and peptides, there is no
significant difference in the frequencies of CD4+ T cells with
unmethylated FOXP3 gene between the different groups of
vaccinated patients. Because of their low in vitro proliferation
capacities, we cannot exclude that we have missed some other
CD25+ T-cell clones with unmethylated FOXP3 during our isolation
procedure.
Out of the 185 CD25 clones, f75% released at least 1 pg of
IFN-g for 500 cells (Table 1). Among the other clones that released
no IFN-g, 10 produced IL-10, 11 produced only IL-4 and/or IL-5,
and 12 produced very little or none of the tested cytokines, such as
clone J2 (Table 2). The production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 by some
anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell clones is in contrast with results
reported by others (32, 33).
Production of active TGF-B by anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell
clones. The production of active TGF-h has been proposed as a
mechanism of suppression by Treg cells (34). As described by
others (35), we previously observed that all human CD4+ T-cell
clones produce the latent, inactive form of TGF-h in response to
activation, but we could not detect the active form of the cytokine
by ELISA in the supernatant of any activated T-cell clone, including
clones with in vitro suppressive activity (19). However, we observed
evidence of TGF-h signal transduction only in activated human
T-cell clones with unmethylated FOXP3 intron 1. Transduction of a
TGF-h signal was evidenced by phosphorylation of SMAD2 and
induction of a TGF-h–specific transcriptional response. This led us
to conclude that only Treg cell clones produced active TGF-h (19).
In the present study, we extended this analysis to the nine T-cell
clones with the highest suppressive activity. Phosphorylation of
SMAD2 and the presence of transcripts SOX4 and ID3, which are
representative of the TGF-h signature in human T cells, were
observed 24 h after activation only in the four clones with
unmethylated FOXP3 intron 1 (Table 2; Fig. 4). The suppressive
activity of clone J1 seemed to be partially inhibited by the presence
of an anti–TGF-h antibody during the coculture with the indicator
cells (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
In mice, CD4+CD25+ T cells have been shown by adoptive
transfer or depletion experiments to prevent autoimmune and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

antitumoral responses in vivo (36–39). These cells, known as Treg
cells, have also been shown to suppress in vitro the proliferation
and cytokine production of CD4+CD25 and CD8+ T cells (40). They
are marked by high CD25 and Foxp3 expression. Transcription
factor Foxp3 is indispensable for the differentiation and function of
these Treg cells. Foxp3 constitutive expression is restricted to these
cells and correlates with the unmethylated status of CpGs located
in intron 1 (26, 29, 41). Mice with a mutation in gene Foxp3 have
autoimmune disorders, which confer their ‘‘scurfy’’ phenotype (42).
In humans, the IPEX syndrome, a fatal multiorgan autoimmune
disease occurring in individuals with mutations in the FOXP3 gene,
strongly suggests the existence of a similar Treg cell compartment
(43, 44). However, as in vivo experimentation is precluded in
humans, the search for evidence of Treg cell responses has to rely
on in vitro suppression tests and on the presence of markers
like FOXP3 and CD25. This can only lead to the claim that one
has observed T cells that are likely to exert a suppressive activity
in vivo. In our analysis of the anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell response
in vaccinated melanoma patients, we have found such potential
Treg cells.
The anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 CD4+ T-cell clones that seem to us to be
the best Treg cell candidates are marked by high CD25 and FOXP3
expression in the resting state. Their FOXP3 gene intron 1 is
unmethylated. They secrete upon stimulation no IFN-g, IL-2, IL-4,
IL-5, or IL-10, but they produce active TGF-h. These clones have a
clear suppressive activity in vitro, which seems attributable, at least
in part, to their secretion of active TGF-h. These clones represent
f5% of the anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 T-cell clones that we have isolated.
Other CD25+ and CD25 T cell clones showed suppressive activity
in vitro, and it cannot be excluded that they have regulatory
potential in vivo.
Our potential anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 Treg cells were found only in
blood samples collected after vaccination. Another group reported
that the frequency of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells increased after
vaccination of cervical carcinoma patients injected with antigenic
peptides encoded by genes E6 and E7 of human papillomavirus 16
(45). Other antigen-specific potential Treg cell clones were
described previously in cancer patients (25, 46, 47). These cells
produced IFN-g and IL-10, in contrast with our clones. Their
suppressive activity was shown to be dependent on cell-cell contact
and seemed not to be attributable to TGF-h or IL-10.
FOXP3 seems of doubtful value as a marker for Treg cells, due
to its transient expression in some activated non-Treg cells and
also, as shown here, on ‘‘resting’’ T cells without suppressive activity (29). Our work and previous studies suggest that
demethylation of FOXP3 is exclusive to T cells with suppressive
activity and stable expression of FOXP3 (19, 31, 41). A quantitative DNA methylation analysis of FOXP3 based on quantitative PCR could become a routine technique to identify the best
Treg cell candidates (48).
We conclude that MAGE-A3.DP4 vaccination can produce CD4+
T cells that may influence the outcome of the treatment by exerting
Treg cell function. The anti–MAGE-A3.DP4 potential Treg cells
were isolated from the blood of four patients, including two
patients with a mixed clinical response. This suggests, at first,
that the occurrence of these T cells is not sufficient to prevent
tumor regression after vaccination. We have, nevertheless, no
information about the presence of these cells at the tumor site.
Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of FOXP3, together with the
relative frequencies of Treg cells and effector T cells at the tumor
site, could become critical pieces of information to better establish
