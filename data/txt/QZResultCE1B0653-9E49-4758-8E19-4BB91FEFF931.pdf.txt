Abstract:

A major endeavour in cancer chemotherapy is to develop agents that specifically
target a biomolecule of interest. There are two main classes of targeting
agents: small molecules and biologics. Among biologics (e.g.: antibodies),
DNA, RNA but also peptide aptamers are relatively recent agents. Peptide
aptamers are seldom described but represent attractive agents that can inhibit
a growing panel of oncotargets including Heat Shock Proteins. Potential pitfalls
and coming challenges towards successful clinical trials are presented such
as optimizing the delivery of peptide aptamers thanks to Nanotechnology.

response they inherently trigger, efforts were devoted
to design new generations of antibodies switching
from murine antibodies to: chimeric (~60% human,
example: Cetuximab[7]), humanized (~90% human,
e.g.: Trastuzumab) or human antibodies (100%, e.g.:
Panitumumab). Up to now, biologics have in fact a higher
rate of approval success rate (18% for chimeric and 24%
humanized monoclonal antibodies) than new chemical
entities including small molecules (5%)[3, 8] especially
in oncology[3].

Rational drug design is the quest, launched by
Paul Ehrlich about a century ago, for designing a ‘magic
bullet’: a targeting agent that specifically interacts with,
and mostly inhibits, a biomolecule of interest. Essentially,
this biomolecule is an intracellular or membrane-bound
protein identified as contributing to a disease state. The
choice of the protein to be targeted is constrained by our
ability obtain highly specific, bioactive ligands. Usually,
for small molecules, a requirement is the presence of a
pocket (e.g.: the ATP-binding cavity of protein kinases)
where the targeting agent can fit snugly and establish the
multiple low-energy interactions in 3 dimensions that
confers its (high) affinity and specificity.
Within the last 10 years[1], a number of such
targeting agents have been discovered by screening or
rational design. They fall in 2 classes: small molecules and
biologics. The former are developed by (pharmaceutical)
chemists, with imatinib as an archetype. The latter
originate from molecular biologists and are typically
represented by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as
trastuzumab or cetuximab. Due to their size (molecular
weight <500Da[2]), small molecules are relatively easy
to synthesize, can diffuse well (including through the
membrane bilayer) and are generally orally available[3].
On the other hand, mAbs are large (~150kDa[4, 5])
and complex molecules[6] that are delivered intratumorally or intravenously[3]. To reduce the immune

A new tool: peptide aptamers
Among biologics, aptamers (a word combining the
Latin aptus ‘fitting’ with the Greek meros ‘part’[9]) are
emerging as a new class of targeting agents. Aptamers
(i.e.: DNA, RNA aptamers) but also peptide aptamers are
indeed apt to specifically inhibit biomolecules of interest
with high affinity[9-11].
Peptide aptamers consist of a short (~10-20 amino
acids), conformationally constrained[12] variable random
peptide sequence inserted into a scaffold protein (most
often the bacterial protein thioredoxin A[12, 13]) as shown
in figure 1. They can thus be considered as miniaturized,
simplified antibodies[12, 13]. A unique feature of peptide
aptamers relies in their doubly constrained target-binding
loop[13], compared to other man-made biomolecules that
consist of peptidic sequences fused terminally to a carrier

protein. Constrained conformations[13-15] require less
energy to bind the target of interest, resulting in peptide
aptamers with high affinities and KD values in the 10 – 100
nM range[10, 12]. Compared to monoclonal antibodies,
DNA, RNA and peptide aptamers are relatively small,
weighting ~10-20kDa[16] with reduced immunogenicity
compared to antibodies[9].

phase II clinical trials including solid tumours[18].
More recently developed, peptide aptamers are
to date tested in preclinical models only. In the context
of oncology, in vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that
peptide aptamers are able to inhibit a growing panel of
oncotargets including: the human papillomavirus HPV16
E6 oncoprotein[19] in 2000, ErbB2 receptor[20], mutant
p53[21], but also HSP70[22] and HSP27[23] within these
last months. So what are the foreseen barriers towards
successful clinical trials?

Reaching the tumor

Of the ~108,400 recorded clinical trials (http://
clinicaltrials.gov/, last access: the 8th of June 2011), ~5,500
are involving targeted therapies, with ~1,700 in the field
of oncology. Among these, there are ~500 trials assessing
peptides but only 3 studies concerning aptamers (none
with peptide aptamers). There are at least 2 interesting
approaches to be enlightened. One is the success of
Pegaptanib sodium (Macugen, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals/
Pfizer), the first FDA-approved aptamer (December 2004)
for use in humans. As with other types of agents, it took
about a decade of preclinical development to improve
and characterize its biological effects[17]. Nevertheless,
this anti-VEGF pegylated RNA aptamer developed
for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular
degeneration is now involved in ~50 trials. Another
interesting example includes AS1411 (4 clinical trials) for
the study of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (2 clinical trials),
Renal Cell Carcinoma (1 clinical trial) and advanced
tumors (1 clinical trial). This DNA aptamer targeting
nucleolin induces apoptosis and may be combined with
cytarabine to obtain a synergistic effect. It is the first-inclass DNA aptamer anticancer agent, and is currently in

To date, peptide aptamers target the cancer cells via
different means. The two most frequent delivery options
are liposome-like chariots and protein transduction
domains (PTDs). Potential issues of the former approach
might be related to toxicity and stability. Concerning the
later, the most widely used PTD, derived from HIV-TAT
protein, is a positively charged sequence that represents
an interesting approach. However, it might affect protein
structure. Far from trivial, delivering the targeting agent
specifically to the desired site of action will more than
probably benefit from nanotechnology. Several ongoing
clinical options exist. They include drug delivery systems
composed of: lipid nanoparticles, albumin-based,
micelles, polymer-based or gold nanoparticles[9] that
should be investigated for peptide aptamers.

Dose calculations
Different from organic small molecules by nature,
dose calculations for biologics nevertheless remain almost
exclusively traditional[24] even though they exhibit
non-linear dose-response curves[6]. As targeting agents
are often combined with cytotoxics (e.g.: doxorubicin,
cisplatin or taxol), drug combinations need careful
evaluation. Also, the design of clinical trials for targeting
agents should be revisited accordingly[25].

Early detection

Tr
io

Obviously, the earlier the disease is detected, the
greater the chances of curing it. Efforts should be devoted
to improve current detection limits. Also, it is necessary
to develop and validate appropriate biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis as well as treatment follow-up[26]. Interestingly,
aptamers can be functionalized onto sensing schemes for
biodetection[9] with the emerging ‘aptasensors’[27].

especially in cancer[8]. One major reason probably
relies in the intrinsic heterogeneity of tumors that
harbour several mutations[37, 38]. Therefore, instead of
heading for the design of the magic bullet, one may in
fact want to broaden the spectrum of targets, and move
towards polypharmacology as interaction networks play
an increasing role in our current understanding of drug
efficacy and side effects[39-41]. It was indeed found for
instance that one of the archetypes of targeted therapy,
imatinib, inhibits other proteins as well and is thus in
fact not perfectly specific[39]. Alternatives to ‘dirty’ or
promiscuous drugs intended to target and inhibit a set of
pathways disrupted in cancer include targeting a molecular
chaperone, ideally an inducible heat shock protein[22,
23, 42]. The rational is that cancer cells, because they
must extensively rewire their metabolic and signalling
networks, need for their survival an abundant content of
chaperones like the inducible HSP70 or HSP27 that are no
or hardly expressed in normal cells. This general cancer
cells’ addiction to heat shock proteins make the recently
described HSP70 and HSP27 peptide aptamers all the
more interesting as sensitizing agents in cancer therapy.
However, the use of peptide aptamers as targeting agents
in cancer therapy need to be carefully validated since the
existing data is only preclinical.

right panel of patients. Cancer is known to be a highly
heterogeneous disease. For instance, the EGFR pathway
is disrupted in fewer than 15% of patients with lung
cancer[28]. One of the 4 EGFR family member, HER2,
is overexpressed in ~30% of breast cancers[6, 29]. Thus,
averaging the response of a few responders in an overall
non-responding group would be cancelled out and the
development of companion diagnostics to eventually
identify suitable patients is mandatory.

Side effects: evolution for every one
Since “Nothing makes sense in medicine except in
the light of biology”[30] and also that “Nothing in biology
makes sense except in the light of evolution”[30], it may
prove useful to get insights from an evolutionary process
that shaped us over a couple of billions of years. The quest
for new agents have led to some disastrous clinical trials
like CAST and SWORD in cardiology[31]. Some of the
lessons learned are that searching for druggable portions
of different types of ion channels (e.g.: sodium, potassium)
may lead to a common –well conserved- protein domain
(e.g.: the pore-forming modules[32]) that is shared by
those different types of channels[33], potentially leading
to undesired effects and complex cardiac patterns[31],
sometimes lethal. In cancer, a similar pitfall was recently
noticed when assessing the selectivity of erlotinib
hydrochloride, gefitinib and imatinib for instance[29].
Targeting ATP-pockets is actually a very common trend
in rational drug design since these pockets exhibit high
druggability indexes and may be seen as a bias from the
concept of druggability. Therefore, when intending to
design a specific inhibitor, one should also evaluate sets of
related targets which contain similar pockets. For protein
kinases for instance, the human kinome space was found
to consist of 518 kinases[34]. As a general guideline, a
threshold of 60% sequence identity was determined for
the ATP-pocket that differentiated between binding sites
of related kinases versus variations in the binding sites
of the same kinase[35]. This indicates that kinases with a
sequence identity >60% have a high probability of being
inhibited by the same compounds[35]. Peptide aptamers
were in fact developed to circumvent the requirement
of targeting pockets and to address other types of target
sites, non-druggable by small molecules. They can inhibit
protein function via the disruption of protein-protein
interactions or a number of other mechanisms[36]. In the
context of protein kinases, inhibitory peptide aptamers
would be expected to be more specific than their small
molecules inhibitors, thereby reducing side-effects related
to off-targets inhibition.
