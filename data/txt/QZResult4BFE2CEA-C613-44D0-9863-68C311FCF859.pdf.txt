Genome Remodeling in a Basal-like Breast Cancer Metastasis
and Xenograft
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Abstract
Author Manuscript

Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented ability to screen entire
genomes for genetic changes associated with tumor progression. Here we describe the genomic
analyses of four DNA samples from an African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer:
peripheral blood, the primary tumor, a brain metastasis, and a xenograft derived from the primary
tumor. The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the
primary tumor, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all
primary tumor mutations, and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that paralleled the
metastasis (16 of 20 genes). Two overlapping large deletions, encompassing CTNNA1, were
present in all three tumor samples. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation
patterns in metastasis and xenograft compared to the primary tumor suggest that secondary tumors
may arise from a minority of cells within the primary.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Basal-like breast cancer is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER)
expression, the lack of ERBB2 gene amplification, and a high mitotic index. The consequent
absence of approved targeted therapy options and frequently poor response to standard
chemotherapy often result in a rapidly fatal clinical course. The disease also accounts for an
elevated percentage of breast cancers in patients with African ancestry1. Clinical progress
has been limited by a poor understanding of the genetic events responsible for this tumor
subtype and by limited preclinical models to study the disease. Since basal-like breast cancer
has a highly unstable genome, a key question is whether the fatal metastatic process is
driven by mutations that occur after the tumor cells arrive at the distant site, or whether the
primary tumor generates cells with a complete repertoire of somatic mutations required for
metastatic growth. The rapid advancement of next generation sequencing technologies

Results
Case presentation and prior characterization of samples

Author Manuscript

A 44-year old African-American woman was diagnosed with an ERBB2 negative and ER
negative inflammatory breast cancer. She was treated with neoadjuvant dose-dense
chemotherapy2, but significant residual tumor was present in the breast and axillary lymph
nodes at mastectomy. This indicated chemotherapy resistance and she underwent radiation
therapy. Eight months later, she developed a cerebellar metastasis and, despite resection,
rapidly succumbed to widely disseminated disease. A transplantable Human-in-Mouse
(HIM) xenograft tumor line was generated from a sample of her primary tumor biopsied
before treatment3. The xenograft in the mammary fat pad was locally invasive and produced
metastatic deposits in lymph nodes and ovaries. Informed consent for full genome
sequencing was obtained and DNA samples were prepared from her peripheral blood,
primary tumor, brain metastasis, and an early passage xenograft (harvested 101 days after
initial engrafting into the mouse host). Application of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype
algorithm identified the primary tumor, brain metastasis, and xenograft line as basal-like
subtype, with high risk of relapse (ROR) scores4.
Sequence coverage and mutation analysis

Author Manuscript

Using a paired-end sequencing strategy, we generated 130.7, 124.9, 111.8, and 149.2 billion
base pairs of sequence data from genomic DNA derived from blood, primary tumor, brain
metastasis, and xenograft samples, respectively, with corresponding haploid coverages of
38.8X, 29.0X, 32.0X, and 23.8X (Supplementary Table 1). These genome-wide coverages
were assessed by comparing SNVs detected by MAQ5 with SNPs genotyped using Illumina
1M duo arrays for all tissues excluding the xenograft. Array data from the metastasis were
used as a surrogate for monitoring the xenograft SNP coverage and confirmed bi-allelic
detection of 98.27%, 96.79%, 96.17%, and 88.77% of the heterozygous array SNPs in the
normal, primary tumor, metastasis, and xenograft sequence datasets, respectively
(Supplementary Table 1).

Author Manuscript

The process for selecting somatic mutations is shown in Supplementary Table 2 and is
detailed in Supplementary Information. Putative somatic SNVs and indels that overlap with
coding sequences, splice sites, and RNA genes were included as “tier 1”. We combined tier
1 sites identified in all three tumor samples and obtained deep read count data for all four
samples from Illumina and/or 454 platforms (Supplementary Information). Based on
pathology review, the tumor cellularity estimates were 70% for the primary tumor and 90%
for both the brain metastasis and xenograft. Utilizing these estimates, we calculated the
tumor read counts by proportionally removing the counts derived from the normal tissue
reads from the counts obtained from primary tumor and metastasis reads (Supplementary
Table 3a). Using the Illumina platform, we also generated 15.6 Gb (4.4X haploid coverage)
of sequence data for the NOD/SCID mouse genome used as the host for the xenograft line.

The mapping rates of NOD/SCID data to human and mouse C57BL/6 reference sequences
were 3.17% and 95.85%, respectively. Since the non-malignant contamination in xenograft
is largely from murine cells (which do not significantly affect read mapping), no correction
was applied for the xenograft data. Adjusted tumor read counts were used to calculate
mutant allele frequencies. Somatic changes were validated by comparing mutant allele
frequencies in the three tumor genomes against the germline DNA sample, combined with a
manual review of ABI 3730 data from PCR products (Supplementary Information).

Author Manuscript

In summary, a total of 50 somatic sites, including 28 missense, 11 silent, 2 splice site, 1
RNA, 1 nonsense, 4 insertions, and 3 deletions, were validated in at least one of the three
tumor genomes. Of coding point mutations, the observed nonsynonymous:synonymous
(NS:SS) ratio of 2.64:1 (29:11) is not significantly different from that expected by chance6
(P = 0.51), suggesting that the majority of coding mutations do not confer a selective
advantage to the basal tumor. This is similar to the NS:SS ratio reported in the small-cell
lung cancer cell line NCI-H2097, but higher than the ratio reported in the melanoma cell line
COLO-8298.
Mutation spectrum in basal breast tumor

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We investigated the spectrum of DNA sequence changes in this basal tumor and found 55%
(22/40) of coding point mutations represent C:G->T:A transitions. A similar frequency of
C:G->T:A transitions (56% (18/32)) was observed in the lobular breast tumor recently
reported9 (Figure 1a). In addition, 15% (6/40) of coding point mutations representing C:G>A:T transversions were detected in the basal tumor, but none were found in the lobular
tumor. The statistical significance of these observations should be explored with the
comparative analysis of a larger number of basal and lobular breast tumors. Moreover, the
observed C:G->T:A transition frequency is notably higher than those observed in a previous
breast cancer study10 (P = 0.027; Figure 1b). A set of extremely high confidence tier 1-4
mutations (somatic score > 55 and average mapping quality > 79) was used to explore the
genome-wide mutation spectrum. We found that mutations at A:T bases are significantly
expanded in the genome-wide set compared to the coding mutations, especially for A:T>G:C transitions (P = 0.0065). This is consistent with the higher A:T content in non-coding
sequences than in coding sequences. Comparison to the whole-genome mutation spectrum
reported for the melanoma cell line (COLO-829)8 and a small cell lung cancer cell line
(NCI-H209)7 suggests that the tumor genome under study shows no sign of tobacco or
ultraviolet influence. We then compared the fraction of the three classes of guanine
mutations occurring at CpG dinucleotides in primary tumor, brain metastasis, and xenograft
and found that the frequencies of G->A mutations are 27.54%, 27.60%, and 28.05% in each
respective tumor, significantly higher than both the genome average of 4.45% (P < 10-10)
and the frequency reported in NCI-H209 (P < 10-10; Figure 1c).
Distribution of mutations among tumors
1. Common mutations detected in three tumor genomes—Of the 50 validated
point mutations and small indels, 48 are detectable in all three tumors. We performed a
statistical enrichment test that takes the variations of different platforms, experiments, and
primer pairs into consideration (Supplementary Information). These 48 sites consist of (1A)

20 sites with relatively comparable frequencies across tumors, (1B) 26 sites significantly
enriched (FDR ≤ 0.05) in the metastasis and/or xenograft, and (1C) two sites with significant
enrichment (FDR ≤ 0.05) in the primary tumor (Figure 2 and Table 1). The affected genes
and the likely consequences of these mutations are summarized in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 3b.

Author Manuscript

1A. Mutations with comparable frequencies in three tumors: We detected a JAK2
mutation (I166T), residing in the FERM domain, which is different from the previously
reported activating mutations in myeloproliferative diseases, often found in the
pseudokinase domain11. Screening of an additional 116 breast tumors identified another
mutation (R1122P) in the kinase domain of JAK2 from a Luminal B-type breast cancer. A
splice site mutation (e8-1) was found in IRAK2. We performed an RT-PCR experiment
using RNAs from the brain metastasis and xenograft and found that the first 30 nucleotides
of exon 8 (IRAK2, NM_001570) were skipped and an internal exonic AG site was used as a
splice acceptor, resulting in an in-frame deletion. A missense mutation (A401S) in CSMD1
was found in all three tumors. Loss of CSMD1 expression is associated with poor survival in
invasive ductal breast carcinoma12 and it is frequently deleted in colorectal adenocarcinoma
and head/neck carcinomas13. We also identified 3 missense (E608K, T1456R, and Q2204R)
and 1 nonsense (Q3005*) mutations in CSMD1 in 4 breast cancers out of 116 screened. A
binomial test shows that CSMD1 is significantly mutated in breast cancer (P = 0.022 and
FDR = 0.197)(Supplementary Table 4).

Author Manuscript

1B. Mutations highly enriched in metastasis and/or xenograft: A missense mutation
(A681E) in NRK, a protein kinase involved in activating JNK, was found to be present in all
three tumors, but at 8- and 13-fold increased allele frequencies in the metastasis and
xenograft, respectively (Figure 2 and Table 1). Two somatic mutations (S424C and Q521*)
in NRK have been previously reported in breast cancer14. The missense mutation (P461L)
identified in the C-terminus of MAP3K8 was present at a roughly 6-fold increase in the
xenograft compared to the primary tumor. C-terminal truncation of MAP3K8 has been
shown to activate this oncogenic kinase15,16, raising the possibility that this C-terminal
substitution (P461L) is an activating mutation.

Author Manuscript

Another missense mutation (K1017N) in PTPRJ, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, had a
mutant allele frequency of 32% in the metastasis and 57% in the xenograft compared to just
1.3% in the primary tumor. This K1017N mutation in PTPRJ is among the most highly
enriched mutations in both the metastasis (FDR = 0.00035) and xenograft (FDR = 0.00022).
The mutation site is in the juxtamembrane domain (a basic residue motif) and is in close
proximity to the tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain (aa 1041-1298). Sacco et al.17
reported that the PTPRJ charged peptide (aa 1013-1024) is responsible for interaction with
its substrates, such as ERK1/2. The K1017N mutation found in the basal tumor and the
K1016A mutation described in Sacco's report both change a basic residue to a neutral
residue, suggesting these two mutations may be functionally similar. A missense mutation
(F299V) in WWTR1, assigned as deleterious by SIFT18, was detected at 28% mutant allele
frequency in metastasis, but only at 7% and 10% in primary tumor and xenograft,
respectively (Figure 2 and Table 1). WWTR1, a 14-3-3 binding protein with a PDZ binding

motif, has been shown to modulate mesenchymal stem cell differentiation19. Overexpression of WWTR1 has also been implicated in promoting the migration, invasion, and
tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells20.

Author Manuscript

Another point mutation (R258Q) was identified in CHGB (chromogranin B) encoding a
tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein. A SNP at the same position was reported to dbSNP in
January 2009 for a Yoruba sample. It was also assigned as a germline site in another
African-American with breast cancer when we genotyped this mutation in 112 additional
primary tumors and 73 metastatic tumors of various expression classes (Supplementary
Information). To investigate this variant further, 84 cancer-free African American women
with an average age of 71.2 yrs (low risk for developing breast cancer) and 38 early-onset
African American breast cancer patients with an average age of 35.6 yrs were genotyped.
The results indicated that 8 out of 84 controls and 3 out of 38 cases carried the variant allele,
suggesting this variant is unlikely to be a breast cancer susceptibility allele.
Three validated indels were enriched in the metastasis and/or xenograft. One was the 1-bp
insertion in exon 4 of the TP53 gene, which creates a frameshift mutation (Q167fs) in the
DNA binding domain and results in a truncated protein. We found the TP53 mutation
significantly enriched in the xenograft, while present at a relatively constant frequency in
primary tumor and metastasis (Figure 2 and Table 1).
1C. Mutations enriched in the primary tumor: A nonsense mutation (Q2222*) in
MYCBP2 and a missense mutation (E576K) in TGFBI, both found in all three tumors, had
higher mutant allele frequencies in the primary tumor (88% for MYCBP2 and 89% for
TGFBI) than in the metastasis (44% for MYCBP2 and 38% for TGFBI) or the xenograft
(37% for MYCBP2 and 18% for TGFBI) (Figure 2 and Table 1).

Author Manuscript

2. De novo mutations identified in the metastasis—Two de novo mutations were
discovered in the metastatic tumor, neither of which was detected in the primary or
xenograft tumor genomes. One was a missense mutation (T708I) in SNED1, with a mutant
allele frequency of 37%. The other was a silent mutation (N2483) in FLNC with a mutant
allele frequency of 18% (Figure 2 and Table 1). Since the xenograft line, without these two
mutations, exhibits metastatic lesions in ovarian, lymphoid, and subcutaneous tissue (data
not shown), it is unlikely that these mutated genes are essential to the metastatic process.
Elevated copy number alterations in metastasis and xenograft

Author Manuscript

The cnvHMM algorithm (unpublished) was applied to the aligned sequence reads to detect
regions of copy number alterations in all three tumors. Using pathology-based purity
estimates for the primary tumor and brain metastasis, we calculated the read depth
contributed from the tumor cells alone and then computed the copy number for all genomic
positions. Read depth correction was not applied to the xenograft, as stated earlier. We
subsequently compared the copy number data from all three tumors with those from
peripheral blood, to identify genomic segments with significant copy number alterations
(CNAs) (Supplementary Information). A total of 516.5 Mb, 640.4 Mb, and 754.5 Mb were
amplified, while 342.5 Mb, 383.1 Mb, and 562.5 Mb were deleted, in primary tumor,
metastasis, and xenograft, respectively (Supplementary Table 5-7). Moreover, 96.11% and

93.98% of CNA sequences in the primary tumor also were found in CNA segments in the
metastasis and xenograft respectively, suggesting most primary tumor CNAs are preserved
during disease progression and engraftment. On the other hand, only 80.65% of metastasis
and 61.29% of xenograft CNA sequences overlap with primary tumor CNAs. Furthermore,
155 regions with focal copy number segments (≤ 2Mbp) were detected in the primary tumor,
but only 101 and 97 regions in the metastasis and xenograft (Supplementary Table 8-10).
Our result also shows that 111 (average span = 745,183 bp) and 99 (average span = 799,395
bp) focal copy number segments (≤ 2Mbp) in the primary tumor overlap with broader copy
number segments in the metastasis (average span = 2,245,546 bp) and xenograft (average
span = 3,565,456 bp), suggesting possible expansion of primary focal regions or selection of
new adjacent events during disease progression and in the mouse host. Sequence depthbased copy number analysis shows overall the highest concordance with other platforms,
including the array CGH and Illumina SNP array, and also provided the highest concordance
of copy number (correlation coefficients: 0.89-0.97) between primary tumor, metastasis, and
xenograft(Supplementary Table 11).
Common and unique structural variations in three tumors
We used BreakDancer 21 to detect structural variants (SV) in sequencing data from paired
end libraries (Supplementary Table 12) and applied a set of thresholds to identify putative
somatic structural events.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

1. Deletions, insertions, and inversions—Breakpoint-containing contigs from the
three tumor samples, that were not present in the matched normal genome, were successfully
assembled for 137 deletions, 15 insertions, and 38 inversions using the TIGRA assembler
(unpublished), suggesting they were putative somatic events. We then re-mapped individual
reads to these assembled contigs to screen out germline SVs and to confirm somatic SVs
(Supplementary Information), resulting in the detection of 59 deletions and 18 inversions.
PCR primers were designed successfully to validate 73 out of 77 putative SV events and the
resulting amplicons were sequenced by either the Roche454 or ABI 3730 platform.
Subsequently, 28 deletions and 6 inversions were validated as somatic events (Table 2).
Among them, a 46,462 bp heterozygous deletion in FBXW7 removes the last 10 exons and a
portion of the first exon of NM_018315, likely inactivating FBXW7. FBXW7 targets Cyclin
E and mTOR for ubiquitin-mediated degradation22,23. Numerous cancer-associated
mutations in FBXW7 have been previously reported, and loss of FBXW7 function causes
chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis24. Two overlapping deletions (538,467 bp and
515,465 bp in length) on chromosome 5, affecting CTNNA1 along with LRRTM2, MATR3,
SNORA74A, and SIL1 also were validated. This result is consistent with the detection of a
focal copy number deletion encompassing this region in both metastasis (copy number =
0.65) and xenograft (copy number = 0.03) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 9 and 10).
Careful examination of this region in the aligned sequence reads for the primary tumor
confirms the existence of copy number deletion. Loss of CTNNA1 was shown to result in
global loss of cell adhesion in human breast cancer cells25 and increased in vitro
tumorigenic characteristics26, suggesting this bi-allelic deletion has functional importance.
A 109,563 bp heterozygous deletion on chromosome 8 was assembled and validated in all
three tumors. This event removed three exons of NRG1, which encodes a peptide growth

factor that binds to ERBB3 and ERBB4. Interestingly, a 26,919 bp deletion in MECR was
only identified, assembled, and validated in the metastasis, suggesting its de novo nature in
this sample.

2. Translocations—Of the 112 assembled putative translocations, 34 passed manual
review using Pairoscope graphs (unpublished), and 19 with an assembly score greater than
our experimentally-supported cutoff of 10 were included in Supplementary Table 13. Seven
translocations were experimentally validated (Table 2). One validated translocation t(4;9)
(188855443;139022258), assembled in all three tumors, involved an LTR from the ERVLMaLR family on chromosome 4 and ABCA2 on chromosome 9. The translocation removes
the final exon of the ABCA2 gene (NM_001606). Two other validated translocations,
identified in all three tumors, are t(1;2)(245548338;64855172) and t(2;6)
(64855607;144243116) (Supplementary Figure 1). Noticeably, the breakpoints on
chromosome 2 for these two translocations are only separated by 393 bp in a TcMar-Tigger
repeat. The chromosome 1 breakpoint of t(1;2)(245548338;64855172) is in intron 5 of
NM_032752 in ZNF496. We expect the translation of ZNF496 to continue through exon 5
into intron 5 due to lack of a splice acceptor site. On the other hand, t(2;6)
(64855565;144243116) involves FAM164B on chromosome 6 and the translocation contig
retains 3 exons of XM_928657. We have also validated t(1:6)(245548342;144243110) (not
detected by BreakDancer), whose breakpoints are only 4 bp and 6 bp away from the
breakpoints identified on chromosomes 1 and 6 for t(1;2)(245548338;64855172) and t(2;6)
(64855607;144243116), respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). This translocation is found
in both the primary tumor and the metastasis, but apparently is lost in the xenograft
(Supplementary Figure 1 and 4). Sequencing of two PCR products generated using two
primer pairs from chromosomes 1 and 6 demonstrated the presence of two forms of genomic
fusions: one includes chromosomes 1 and 6 and the other includes chromosomes 1, 2, and 6.
The former is only present in the primary tumor and the metastasis.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our comprehensive analysis of this sample set identified 50 novel somatic point mutations
and small indels in coding sequences, RNA genes, and splice sites as well as 28 large
deletions, 6 inversions and 7 translocations. In terms of functional annotation, a hierarchy
can be suggested. The first level includes somatic changes likely to be functional, such as
the small indel in TP53, the large heterozygous deletion in FBXW7, and the bi-allelic
deletion in CTNNA1. The second level consists of non-synonymous mutations in genes
previously noted to be targeted for somatic mutation in cancer or found to be recurrently
mutated in this study, although the exact mutations are novel and their functional importance
requires further investigation (JAK2, PTCH2, CSMD1, and NRK). The third level contains
mutations known to be related to signal transduction in the malignant cells and/or found to
be enriched during disease progression (MAP3K8, PTPRJ, and WWTR1). The final level, by
far the largest group, awaits the acquisition of new data. Analysis of germline variants for
over 500 classic tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes27 identified a large number of
SNPs, none of which were unequivocal hereditary breast cancer susceptibility alleles (data
not shown).

The wide range of mutant allele frequencies suggests considerable genetic heterogeneity in
the cellular population at the primary site. The mutation frequency range narrowed in brain
metastasis and xenograft, suggesting the metastatic and transplantation processes selected
for cells utilizing a distinct subset of the primary tumor mutation repertoire. The overlap
between the mutation frequency changes seen in the metastatic and xenograft samples
argues that genomic progression during xenograft formation is similar to that during
metastasis. Moreover, it suggests that the changes were not therapy-related, since the
xenograft was established prior to any treatment. GO annotation of enriched mutations
suggests that transcription factor activity is possibly selected in xenograft (Supplementary
Table 14). In contrast to our observation of only two new tier 1 mutations at the metastatic
site, sequencing of an indolent metastatic lobular breast tumor showed that the great
majority of the mutations detected were completely novel when compared to the primary
tumor9. However, in this instance, the metastatic process evolved over nine years, as
opposed to less than one year in the case we describe here. Another difference relative to the
lobular cancer genome, where no structural variants were validated, was that paired-end
sequencing detected 41 structural variations within this basal-like tumor genome. Our study
of a primary tumor-metastasis-xenograft trio therefore demonstrates that, while additional
somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variations do occur during the
clinical course of the disease, most of the original mutations and structural variants present
in the primary tumor are propagated. The preservation of all primary mutations in the
xenograft suggests that early passage xenograft lines are valid for functional and therapeutic
studies. However, the altered mutation frequency and elevated degree of copy number
alterations suggest caution when interpreting the results of such experiments.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, the first completed basal-like breast cancer genome is highly complex, as
would be anticipated from a tumor-type associated with chromosomal instability and DNA
repair defects. Indeed this cancer genome, in comparison with the two AML cases published
recently by our group27,28, revealed a 3-4 fold increase in high confidence SNVs genomewide, suggesting a much greater background mutation rate. Future studies should extend our
analysis approach of primary, metastatic, and normal tissue trios and include affected
individuals with diverse geographic origins to produce a complete catalog of recurrent
somatic and inherited variants associated with the development of this common malignancy.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Illumina reads from peripheral blood, primary tumor, metastasis, and xenograft were aligned
to NCBI build36 using MAQ5 and coverage levels were defined by comparison of SNPs
identified by Illumina 1M duo arrays to SNVs called by MAQ. Somatic mutations were
identified using our in-house programs glfSomatic and a modified version of the Samtools
indel caller (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Putative variants were manually reviewed and
then validated by Illumina, 3730 or 454 sequencing. Structural variations were identified
using BreakDancer21, manually reviewed and validated by a combination of localized
Illumina read assembly, PCR and either 3730 or 454 sequencing. A complete description of
the materials and methods used to generate this data set and results is provided in the
Supplementary Information.

Figure 2. Mutant allele frequency from deep read count data

Author Manuscript

The mutant allele frequency of each somatic mutation is shown. Mutations were validated
using both 454 and Illumina sequencing. Each bar represents the average of the frequency
yielded by the two technologies for a single primer pair and the error bars represent the
standard deviation. Data were considered only if there were at least 200 reads from Illumina
sequencing and at least 20 reads from 454 sequencing. If no error bar exists, then data were
only available from a single sequencing platform.

Figure 3. Two overlapping CTNNA1 deletions on chromosome 5 in three tumors

A graph of sequence depths, read pairs, and genes in a 638,468 bp region containing two
overlapping deletions. The top four panels display the read depths at each base and the reads
within the region whose mates mapped at an abnormal distance are displayed as blue bars,
with matched pairs connected by arcs. Two different shades of blue indicate the two separate
allelic deletion events (538,467 bp and 515,465 bp in length). The bottom panel displays
genes annotated in this genomic region.

Figure 4. Circos plots for the primary tumor, metastasis, and xenograft genomes

Circos30 plots display the validated tier 1 somatic mutations, DNA copy number, and
validated structural rearrangements in the primary tumor (a), metastasis (b), and xenograft
(c). Mutations enriched in the primary tumor (a) are labeled in red and mutations enriched in
the metastasis or xenograft are in red (b and c). Mutations and the large deletion unique to
the metastasis are in blue (b). Translocations only present in primary tumor and metastasis
are in green. All shared events are in black. The copy number difference between the tumor
and normal is shown (scale: -4 to 4). No purity-based copy number corrections were used
for plotting.
