Abstract
Aim: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) agonists
have known pleiotropic cardiovascular effects with favourable properties in
vascular remodeling, and specifically in suppression of vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation. A novel vascular stent coating using the PPARg ligand ciglitazone (CCS)
was investigated regarding its effects on endothelialization after 7 and 28 days.
Methods: Microporous bare metal stents (BMS) were coated with ciglitazone by
ultrasonic flux with a load of 255 μg ciglitazone/stent. Sixteen New Zealand white
rabbits, fed a with high cholesterol diet, underwent stent implantation in both iliac
arteries. Everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and BMS were comparators. Histology (CD
31 immunostaining, confocal and scanning electron microscopy, morphometry) was
performed after 7 and 28 days and by OCT (optical coherence tomography) in vivo
after 28 days.
Results: Microscopy showed comparable results with near complete
endothelialization in CCS and BMS (%CD31 above stent struts after 7 days:
67.92±36.35 vs. 84.48±23.86; p = 0.55; endothel % above stent struts: 77.22±27.9
vs. 83.89±27.91; p = 0.78). EES were less endothelialized with minimal fibrin
deposition, not found in BMS and CCS (% CD 31 above struts after 28 days, BMS:
100.0±0.0 vs. EES: 95.9±3.57 vs. CCS: 100.0±0.0; p = 0.0292). OCT revealed no
uncovered struts in all stents after 28 days.
Conclusions: Polymer-free coating with ciglitazone, a PPARg agonist is feasible
and stable over time. Our data prove unimpaired endothelial coverage of a ciglitazonecoated vascular stent system by histology and OCT. Thus, this PPARg agonist coating
deserves further investigation to evaluate its potency on local neointimal suppression.

and cardiac remodeling by prevention of smooth muscle
cell proliferation and migration via various pathways [712]. Ciglitazone is a ligand of PPARg, which also acts as
an antiangiogenic agent [13]. Vascular drug-eluting stents
(DES) with a metallic or bioresorbable backbone have
proven superiority compared to bare metal stents (BMS)
with respect to long-term patency and reduced restenosis
rates [14]. This benefit is partially offset by delayed
endothelial healing requiring prolonged dual antiplatelet
therapy [15, 16]. Despite modern advancements in device
technology, such as new generation DES, bioresorbable
vascular scaffolds (BVS) or drug-coated balloons, the
important issues of persistent peri-stent inflammation and
development of neoatherosclerosis are remaining [17].
Thus, the ideal antiproliferative substance, allowing fast
endothelialisation simultaneously to maximal inhibition of
neointimal proliferation, is still undiscovered. Therefore,
we further investigated PPARg agonists, as an alternative
substance class possibly allowing a favourable course of
vascular remodeling.

Microscopic analysis after 7 days
Scanning electron microscopy and confocal
microscopy after CD31 staining showed comparable
results between CCS stents and BMS, and a fairly well
progressed endothelialization seven days after stent
implantation (Table 1).

Endothelial coverage by En Face SEM after 28
days
All devices appeared widely and evenly expanded in
x-ray evaluation without evidence of stent fractures.
Representative SEM images of implanted stent types
for 28 days are displayed in Figure 1A-1C. The estimated
endothelial coverage of luminal surface was 100 % for
most CCS and BMS and > 70 % for most EES. A few EES
(3 of 6) showed evidence of delayed healing exhibiting
occasional uncovered struts with adherent platelets and
inflammatory cells.

Aims of the Study
We aimed to prove the concept of a novel
ciglitazone-coated stent (CCS) in terms of (1) feasibility of
polymer-free ciglitazone stent coating, and (2) unimpaired
stent endothelialisation after 7 and 28 days, investigated
ex vivo by histology and in vivo by optical coherence
tomography (OCT) in an animal model.

CD31 immunostaining after 28 days
Stents from all three groups showed strong
expression of CD31 over the majority of stent surfaces
indicating mature endothelial cells with good cell-tocell apposition. However, there were several regions
of artefacts, which inaccurately reflected lower and
significantly different % endothelial scores between groups
(Table 2). After exclusion of vessels with artefacts, EES
revealed significantly lower percent endothelialisation
above stent struts (p = 0.0292) and a trend toward lower
endothelialisation between struts (p = 0.0585) as compared
to CCS and BMS (Table 2).

RESULTS
UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis of stent coating
Photometric determined ciglitazone content after
coating of stent systems was 255.15 µg ± 11.95 ciglitazone
per stent system corresponding to ~ 21.3 µg/mm stent
length. The same coating content was measured after
storing stent systems for 4 months at ~ 4 - 7 °C. UV-Vis
spectra of extracted stent systems and standard solutions
were identically after one extraction. HPLC analyses of

DISCUSSION

Morphometry after 28 days

To the best of our knowledge, we investigated for
the first time ciglitazone as an alternative to common
antiproliferative coating substances for vascular stent
systems.
Polymer free coating with a predefined ciglitazone
content is feasible. Stent coating was stable over a tested
storage period of four months. Furthermore, more than
96 % of the ciglitazone coating was released in vivo after
single balloon inflation. We specifically investigated
ciglitazone out of the substance class of thiazolidinediones
since it might exert stronger and additional PPARgindependent antiproliferative effects compared to the
oral antidiabetic agent rosiglitazone. [18, 19] Moreover,
pioglitazone is not suitable for stent coating due to its
lipophilic structure.
We investigated endothelial coverage of the
implanted stents ex vivo with different methods: (1)
en face SEM, (2) immunostaining with CD31, and (3)
histomorphometry; and at two different time points (7
and 28 days). Despite some artifacts, endothelial coverage
was unimpaired and nearly 100 % in CCS revealing
comparability with BMS. More importantly, our data
indicate better endothelialization of CCS compared to
EES in this rabbit model 28 days after stent implantation.
The microscopic data were underlined by in vivo OCT

Tables 3 and 4 display the results from the
histomorphometric analysis. None of the struts in either
groups were malapposed. Minimal fibrin deposition was
only seen in EES with rare fragments present in two
BMS sections and in none of the CCS stents (Table 3).
Endothelialization was essentially complete in both
CCS (99.83 ± 0.28 %) and BMS (98.30 ± 4.16 %) with
significantly lower values in EES (87.35 ± 11.87; p =
0.0185; Table 2). Less inflammation, primarily observed
as macrophage infiltration, was found in EES compared
to CCS and BMS (p = 0.0002; Table 4).

In vivo evaluation by OCT after 28 days
None of the stent struts were malapposed accounting
for well-sized and implanted stents at the index procedure.
There were no differences between CCS and BMS
regarding stent coverage (Figure 2). Almost all stents were
fully contained within the vessel wall (embedded: 100 %

concept of polymer-free ciglitazone coating of a vascular
stent system and its safety in vivo. The absence of fibrin
and a near complete endothelial stent coverage account for
a favorable interaction between ciglitazone, the metallic
cage and arterial vessel wall. Our data are in line with a
previous study suggesting accelerated endothelialization
after arterial denudation in rats orally treated with
troglitazone, another PPARg agonist [25]. Furthermore,
there is growing evidence for the antiproliferative and
anti-inflammatory properties of PPARg agonists from
ex vivo, animal and human studies. PPARg agonists
decrease expression of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs),
suppress macrophage activity and inhibit migration and
proliferation of vascular SMCs [8-12, 26-28]. Also,
inhibitory effects on neointimal hyperplasia, reduction of
restenosis rates and preservation of vein graft intergrity
have been demonstrated in various preclinical and clinical
studies after systemical administration of PPARg [2, 2931]. Given these beneficial effects and the safety results of
this study, we believe it is worth further investigating local
application of PPARg agonists as a novel stent coating or
even for pre-treatment of endovascular grafts.

evaluation, which also showed nearly completed in wall
stent incorporation after 28 days with no differences
between CCS and BMS. In addition, microscopic welladvanced endothelialization of CCS as early as seven days
after stenting comparable to BMS has been demonstrated.
Previous animal and human autopsy studies could show a
corresponding, but deferred arterial healing response after
stent implantation in human coronary arteries compared
to animal iliacal arteries [20]. Thus, our data suggest
safety of an alternative ciglitazone coated stent in vivo in
terms of unaltered endothelialization. EES revealed less
inflammation due to macrophage autophagy as previously
reported [21, 22].
Morphometric analysis in this study revealed
no fibrin deposition on CCS stents compared to EES
and even to BMS. Fibrin is found early after stent
placement and its associations with neointimal growth
and neoatherosclerosis has been shown repeatedly [23].
Fibrin deposition products seem to also act as a direct
stimulus for smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and are
accompanied by platelets, which serves as an attributable
risk for ST [24]. This study was intended to prove the

Clinical implications

coated vascular stent system by histological analysis ex
vivo and by OCT in vivo. Thus, this novel stent coating
deserves further investigation to evaluate its potency on
neointimal suppression.

Ciglitazone might be an interesting alternative to
conventional limus drugs for drug-eluting vascular devices
allowing both, fast stent endothelialisation and neointimal
suppression. Pharmacokinetic studies need to identify
the optimal drug load of ciglitazone. Additional efficacy
studies in swines, which is a better model for proliferation
must further investigate the antiproliferative strength
of a local ciglitazone application before clinical tests in
humans can be planned.

materials and METHODS
Study design
The novel ciglitazone-coated stent (CCS) was
tested in vivo in two small test series in a total of 16
rabbits (Table 5). Rabbits were fed a high cholesterol diet,
and then underwent stent implantation in both common
iliac arteries via carotid artery. Commercially available
bare metal stents (BMS, Yukon Choice 4®, Translumina,
Hechingen, Germany) and everolimus-eluting stents
(EES, Xience V®, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, USA)
were used as comparators. Stented vessel segments were
extracted after 7 or 28 days and processed for post-mortem
histological analysis. In three animals stent coverage was
assessed in vivo using OCT (M2 CV system, LightLab
Imaging Inc., Westford, MA, USA) for intravascular, highresolution imaging as previously described [32] .

Limitations
The high proportion of artifacts limiting confocal
microscopy after immunostaining has to be disclosed.
OCT cannot precisely differentiate the quality of stent
coverage (endothelium versus fibrin deposits). However,
OCT imaging in this study was performed additionally
to extended histological analysis, which was used for
validation of endothelial coverage. Moreover, OCT images
of the different investigated stents give a first impression
for their antiproliferative strength in this animal model.

ciglitazone/stent (225 μg/cm stent length).

Optical coherence tomography

UV-Vis spectroscopy of coating substance

In study series II, three animals (#10-12) were
examined in vivo by OCT: After surgical preparation
of the contralateral carotid artery, the OCT image wire
was advanced to the iliac stents, and OCT imaging was
conducted by proximal balloon inflation and saline
flushing to establish local exsanguination during imaging.
OCT analysis was conducted offline by two investigators
(K.J. & D.M.) blinded to the stent type. Analysis of
stent cross sections was performed at maximum of 1
mm intervals or frame by frame, if irregularities were
observed. Stent struts were counted and classified as
embedded (contained within the vessel wall); apposed and
covered, if tissue was seen above the strut; apposed and
uncovered, if no tissue was detected; or malapposed [33].

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the
ciglitazone test solution and standard solution were
obtained with a spectrophotometer. Coated stent systems
were extracted in 6 ml ethanol by an ultrasonic bath of
15 minutes after coating, and also after storing over a
period of 4 months. Completeness of coating dissolution
was verified with re-extraction of the remaining stent
system. All wavelength scans were performed at room
temperature. The UV-Vis absorption of the test solution
was measured at 228 nm. Absorbance spectra were also
measured at 350 and 200 nm to prove purity of the test
solution. The absorbance of ethanol solution (1µg/ml) was
0.0467 and the content of coating was calculated. After
stent deployment in rabbits the remaining stent system
was extracted in ethanol and filtered. High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted with a
RP18 separation system (UV-Vis detection at 228 nm) and
possibly remaining ciglitazone was measured.

Histological evaluation
Scanning electron microscopy and morphometric
analysis

Animals

Stented iliac arteries were bisected longitudinally to
expose luminal surface. Half of the stents were processed
for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). En face SEM
images were taken at low power (x 15 magnification) to
visually estimate neointimal incorporation of the entire
luminal stent surface. Images were incrementally enlarged
(x 50, x 200 and x 600) and percent endothelial coverage
was visually estimated.
Stented segments were also evaluated by light
microscopy and analyzed with the morphometry software
(IP Lab for Mac OS X, Scanalytics, Rockville, MD).
Each stent section was analysed for strut apposition,
fibrin deposition, granuloma reactions, mineralization
and haemorrhage. Percentages were calculated in relation
to the total number of struts in each section. Endothelial
surface coverage above and between stent struts were
semi-quantified and expressed as the percentage of the
lumen circumference covered by endothelium. The percent
endothelialization was downgraded if loose intercellular
junctions with adherent platelets and/or inflammatory cells
were observed.

This study was conducted at the Institute for
Laboratory Animal Science and Animal Protection
(IVuT) at the University Hospital of Jena according to
the German Protection of Animal Act. The study protocol
was approved by the appropriate State Office of Food
Safety and Consumer Protection (TLLV, Bad Langensalza,
Thuringia; local registration number: 02-028/07). New
Zealand White rabbits were fed an atherogenic Western
diet consisting of 1 % cholesterol 14 days prior stent
implantation and consisting of 0.15% cholesterol for the
remaining study time.

Surgical procedure
Rabbits were anesthetized and access of the carotid
artery was surgically prepared. Endothelial denudation
of both common iliac arteries was conducted using an
angioplasty balloon catheter. Subsequently, animals
received left and right iliac stents. Stents (2.5 x 12 mm in
series I, and 3,0 x 12 in series II) were implanted achieving
moderate oversizing (~ 1.3:1 ratio). A single dose of
heparin (150 IU/kg) was given during catheterization.
Carotid artery was ligated at the end of the procedure.
Rabbits were anticoagulated by daily administration
of aspirin (12 mg / kg) and clopidogrel (4 mg / kg). At
follow-up, animals were euthanized and the distal aorta

were incubated with antibody markers for CD31 (1:20
dilution, Dakom Carpenteria, California). Specific binding
was visualized by the secondary antibody donkey antimouse Alexa Flour 488 (1:150 dilution, Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, California). TOTO-3 iodide was used as a
nuclear counter-stain (1:100 dilution). The specimens were

mounted en face on glass slides and representative images
were acquired (Zeiss™ Pascal laser confocal microscope).
The percentage of CD31 staining was visually estimated
along the entire stent (above and between stent struts) by
conventional fluorescence microscopy. The endothelial
cell marker CD31, also known as platelet endothelial
cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), was identified as
localized expression at the cell´s periphery indicating
mature intercellular junctions. Non-stented proximal
arterial segments served as positive controls.

The study was funded by departmental resources.

± standard deviation (SD). Continuous variables were
compared between groups using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Non-parametric histological scores
were compared using Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis rank sums
tests. Statistical significance was considered for a p - value
< 0.05. Additional post-hoc analysis was performed by
Tukey-Kramer, if statistical significance was shown.
