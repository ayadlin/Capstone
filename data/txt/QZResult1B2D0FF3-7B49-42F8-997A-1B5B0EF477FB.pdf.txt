Regulation of p53 Family Member Isoform ΔNp63α by the
Nuclear Factor-κB Targeting Kinase IκB Kinase β
Aditi Chatterjee, Xiaofei Chang, Tanusree Sen, Rajani Ravi, Atul Bedi, and David Sidransky

Abstract
The p53 family gene p63 plays an instrumental role in cellular stress responses including responses to DNA
damage. In addition to encoding a full-length transcriptional activator, p63 also encodes several dominant
inhibitory isoforms including the isoform ΔNp63α, the function of which is not fully understood. ΔNp63α
is degraded in response to DNA damage, thereby enabling an effective cellular response to genotoxic agents.
Here, we identify a key molecular mechanism underlying regulation of ΔNp63α expression in response to chemotherapeutic agents or tumor necrosis factor-α. We found that ΔNp63α interacts with IκB kinase (IKK), a
multisubunit protein kinase that consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit,
IKKγ. The IKKβ kinase promotes ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α, whereas a kinasedeficient mutant IKKβ-K44A fails to do so. Cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced stimulation of IKKβ caused
degradation of ΔNp63α and augmented transactivation of p53 family–induced genes involved in the cellular
response to DNA damage. Conversely, IKKβ inhibition attenuated cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced degradation of ΔNp63α. Our findings show that IKKβ plays an essential role in regulating ΔNp63α in response to
extrinsic stimuli. IKK activation represents one mechanism by which levels of ΔNp63α can be reduced, thereby
rendering cells susceptible to cell death in the face of cellular stress or DNA damage. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1419–29.

Introduction
The p53 family includes the product encoded by the p53
tumor suppressor gene and its homologues, p63 and p73.
p53 plays an instrumental role in the cellular stress response,
including induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Whereas p53 is frequently lost in human cancers, p63 is located in a region on chromosome
3q27-ter that is amplified in various cancers (1, 2). Both
p63 and p53 genes encode proteins that possess transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. However,
unlike p53, the p63 gene contains two separate promoters
that direct expression of two fundamentally different classes
of proteins (3). One, denoted TAp63, is marked by an acidic
NH2 terminus with homology to the transactivation domain
of p53. A second promoter, located within an intron and over
30 kb downstream, gives rise to NH2-terminally truncated
(ΔN) products that lack the TA domain (3–5). ΔNp63 can
readily compete with p53 (or transactivating p63 or p73

isoforms) for DNA target sites and also form transactivationincompetent heterocomplexes between ΔN proteins and p53,
TAp73, or TAp63 (2, 3, 6). Because ΔNp63 acts as a dominant
negative that counteracts the function of transactivating p53
family members, this dynamic balance is a crucial determinant of cellular responses to genotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents (3, 7, 8).
p63 is constitutively expressed in the stem cell compartment of many epithelial tissues (3). The high level of p63 in
epithelial stem cells is made up almost entirely of ΔNp63 isoforms, indicating a role for dominant-negative or repressive
versions of p63 in epithelial stem cell identity. p63-null mice
lack limbs and a wide range of epithelial structures, including
skin, prostate, breast, and urothelia (9, 10). The inability of
p63-deficient embryos to develop and maintain multilayered,
regenerative epithelia highlights the essential role of p63 in
the survival of epithelial stem cells (9). Whereas p53 and
p73 are stabilized and upregulated in response to genotoxic
insults (UV radiation and chemotherapeutic agents), ΔNp63α
is degraded in response to these agents (11–13). This degradation of ΔNp63α could augment the function of transactivating
p53 family members and enable an effective cellular response
to genotoxic agents (14).
In this study, we identify a key molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of ΔNp63α expression in response to extrinsic stimuli, such as chemotherapeutic agents or tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We show that ΔNp63α interacts
with IκB kinase (IKK), a multisubunit protein kinase that consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory

subunit, IKKγ [NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO); refs. 15, 16].
We find that IKKβ kinase promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α (17). Cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced
stimulation of IKK leads to degradation of ΔNp63α and augments transactivation of p53 family–induced genes involved
in the cellular response to DNA damage. Conversely, inhibition
of IKKβ with a NEMO-binding peptide or small interfering
RNA (siRNA)–mediated silencing IKKβ expression attenuates
cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced degradation of ΔNp63α.
These data show that IKKβ plays an essential role in regulating
ΔNp63α in response to extrinsic stimuli. Our findings suggest
that the activation of IKK may be a mechanism by which levels
of ΔNp63α are reduced, thereby rendering the cells susceptible
to cell death in the face of cellular stress or DNA damage.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. ΔNp63α-Flag was amplified by PCR amplification of ΔNp63α cDNA and cloned into the BamHI and NotI
sites of pCDNA3.1/hygro (Invitrogen). Flag-IKKβ and IKKα
were provided by Dr. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). HA-IKKβ and HA-IKKα were provided by Dr. Zandi
(University of South California, Los Angeles, CA). Mutant
HA-IKKα and Flag-IKKβ were provided by Dr. Green (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Plasmid Ub-HA construct was provided by Dr. Bohmann (University of Rochester,
Rochester, NY). Bax luciferase expression vector was provided
by Dr. John Reed (Burnham Institute for Medical Research,
La Jolla, CA), and p21WAF1 luciferase construct was a gift from
Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD).
All clones were sequenced to rule out any mutation.
Cell cultures and transfection. The human head and neck
cancer cell line JHU-022 and the human lung carcinoma cell
line (H1299) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen),
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells
were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C. H1299 and JHU-022 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using FuGENE
HD transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in
accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. IKKα and
IKKβ siRNAs were obtained from Imgenex. The transfected
cells were treated with or without 75 μmol/L cisplatin or
20 ng/mL TNF-α before harvesting them for cellular lysates.
Antibodies and immunoblot analysis. Monoclonal antip63 (4A4), monoclonal anti-HA, monoclonal anti-IKKβ, and
polyclonal anti-IKKα antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Flag (M2) and anti–βactin antibodies were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
Western blot was performed as described by Chatterjee and
colleagues (11). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described by Chatterjee and colleagues (18).
Immunoprecipitation analysis. Cells were transfected
with various constructs, washed with PBS, and lysed using Triton
X-100 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100] containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Chemical). Lysates
were precleaned with protein A–Sepharose beads and then

1420

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

incubated for 2 h at 4°C with primary antibody or affinity
matrix. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A–Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4°C, and the nonspecific
bound proteins were removed by washing the beads with
the NP40 lysis buffer thrice at 4°C. The beads were loaded in
Laemmli sample buffer directly and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.
Ubiquitination assay. JHU-022 cells were transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmid for HA-tagged ubiquitin and Flag-ΔNp63α, together with or without increasing
amounts of either the IKKβ, IKKβ-K44A, IKKα, or IKKα-K44M
expression plasmid, as indicated. Total amounts of transfected
DNA per transfection were kept constant by pcDNA3
(Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
treated with 25 μmol/L MG132 and collected in lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100] containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Sigma Chemical). Ubiquitinated proteins were recovered by HA resin (Sigma Chemical) and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Flag or anti-p63 antibody.
Measurement of p63 half-life. Cycloheximide (100 μg/mL;
Sigma Chemical) was added to JHU-022 cells 24 h after transfection with the indicated combination of plasmids. Protein
levels were determined by collecting cells at the indicated
time points, and immunoblotting was performed as described above. The membrane was reprobed with β-actin
to confirm equal loading.
Promoter luciferase activity assays. JHU-022 cells were
transiently transfected with either the Bax or p21WAF1 reporter
plasmids along with 500 ng of either ΔNp63α or TAp63α expression plasmid (where indicated) in the presence or absence
of 1.0 μg of either the IKKβ expression plasmid or the empty
pGL3-Basic vector using FuGENE HD according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA concentration in each transfection
was kept constant using pCDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen).
The transfection efficiency was determined by the Renilla luciferase gene-containing pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega). Fortyeight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with
PBS and lysed in a lysis buffer (5× PLBR, Promega) with gentle
shaking at room temperature for 20 min. Cell lysates were
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm on a table top centrifuge for 2 min
to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to
a fresh tube, and the dual-luciferase activity in cell extracts
was determined according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Promega). Briefly, each assay mixture contained 2 μL (2 μg)
of the cell lysates and 10 μL of a firefly luciferase–measuring
buffer (LAR ll R, Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was
measured by a luminometer (the luminometer was programmed to perform a 2-s premeasurement delay followed
by a 10-s measurement period for each reporter assay). After
measuring the promoter luciferase activity (Stop & Glo, Promega), a Renilla luciferase–measuring buffer was added, and
the Renilla luciferase activity was then measured. Each transfection was performed in duplicate, and all experiments were
repeated at least thrice.
Apoptosis assays. JHU-022 cells were transfected with
500 ng of either ΔNp63α or TAp63α expression plasmid
(where indicated) in the presence or absence of 1.0 μg of

either the IKKβ expression plasmid or the empty pcDNA3.1

V and propidium iodide staining. Percentage apoptosis was
determined by analyzing the cells on the FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data analysis was done using the
software CellQuest.

Results
IKK interacts with and regulates ΔNp63α in response to
cisplatin or TNF-α. We performed isoform-specific real-time
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to detect
isoforms containing or lacking the NH2-terminal transactivation domain (TAp63α and ΔNp63α, respectively) in JHU-022
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells.
Whereas ΔNp63α mRNA is highly expressed in JHU-022 cells,
these cells exhibit very low expression of TAp63α mRNA
(expression of ΔNp63α mRNA is >23-fold more abundant
than that of TAp63α mRNA; Fig. 1A). In accordance with
the differential expression of ΔNp63α and TAp63α mRNA,
Western blot analysis confirmed that JHU-022 cells display
high levels of ΔNp63α protein but undetectable levels of
the TAp63α isoform (Fig. 1A).
We examined the effect of cisplatin on expression of
ΔNp63α in JHU-022 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with
cisplatin resulted in decreased levels of ΔNp63α within
8 hours of exposure (Fig. 1B). The loss of ΔNp63α in response
to cisplatin was associated with concomitant accumulation of
the IKK subunits IKKα and IKKβ in the nuclear fractions of
treated cells (Fig. 1B). This inverse relationship raised the possibility that activation of IKK may play a role in the reduction
of ΔNp63α in response to cisplatin treatment. To explore this
notion, we investigated whether ΔNp63α physically interacts
with either IKKα or IKKβ in JHU-022 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding either HA-IKKα or Flag-IKKβ. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-p63 antibody showed the
presence of endogenous ΔNp63α in anti-Flag or anti-HA
precipitated immune complexes from transfected cell lysates
(Fig. 1C, i). Conversely, immunoblot analysis with either an
anti–IKKα-specific or an anti–IKKβ-specific antibody revealed the presence of both IKK subunits in anti-Flag immunoprecipitates derived from lysates of JHU-022 cells
transfected with Flag-ΔNp63α (Fig. 1C, ii). The interaction
between endogenous ΔNp63α and IKKβ was established by
immunoblot analysis of anti-p63 immunoprecipates with an
anti-IKKβ antibody and further confirmed by immunoblot
analysis of anti-IKKβ immunoprecipates with an anti-p63 antibody (Fig. 1C, iii). These results confirmed the interaction between ΔNp63α and the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex.
To determine whether the levels of ΔNp63α are influenced
by IKK, JHU-022 cells were exposed to TNF-α, a cytokine that
activates the IKK complex. Treatment of cells with TNF-α
resulted in the loss of ΔNp63α within 10 hours of exposure
(Fig. 1D, i). To investigate the role of IKK activity in TNF-α–
mediated reduction of ΔNp63α, JHU-022 cells were exposed
to TNF-α in the presence of a cell-permeable NEMO (IKKγ)–
binding domain (NBD) peptide, which prevents the activation of the IKK complex. Pretreatment of cells with the

www.aacrjournals.org

NBD peptide prevented TNF-α–mediated reduction of
ΔNp63α, thereby confirming the requirement of IKK activity
in cytokine-induced loss of ΔNp63α (Fig. 1D, i). To determine whether IKK activity mediates an analogous loss of
ΔNp63α in response to genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents,
JHU-022 cells were treated with cisplatin with or without pretreatment with the NBD peptide. Cisplatin-mediated reduction of ΔNp63α was attenuated in the presence of the NBD
peptide (Fig. 1D, ii).
IKKβ kinase activity mediates the reduction of ΔNp63α
levels by cisplatin or TNF-α. IKK is a multisubunit protein
kinase that consists of two catalytic subunits: IKKα and
IKKβ. To determine the identity of the specific IKK subunit
responsible for decreasing ΔNp63α, JHU-022 cells were
transfected with expression vectors encoding either wildtype IKKβ or IKKα, or their respective kinase-deficient mutants (IKKβ-K44A and IKKα-K44M). Forced overexpression
of IKKβ significantly decreased the steady-state levels of
ΔNp63α in JHU-022 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, overexpression of the kinase-deficient IKKβ-K44A in JHU-022 cells did
not result in a corresponding reduction of ΔNp63α (Fig. 2B).
Unlike IKKβ, overexpression of either IKKα (Fig. 2C) or its
kinase-deficient mutant IKKα-K44M (data not shown) did
not affect any significant change in the steady-state level of
ΔNp63α.
To determine whether IKKβ directly affects the stability of
ΔNp63α, we examined the effect of cotransfecting a p63- and
p53-deficient lung cancer cell line (H1299) with an expression
vector encoding ΔNp63α and an expression vector encoding
either wild-type or kinase-deficient IKK subunits. Forced expression of IKKβ, but not its kinase-deficient mutant, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in levels of expression
of exogenous ΔNp63α (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, forced expression of IKKα did not affect the levels of expression of
exogenous ΔNp63α (Fig. 2C). Whereas IKKβ decreased the
level of exogenous ΔNp63α, forced expression of IKKβ did
not affect the levels of exogenous TAp63α in H1299 cells
(Fig. 2D). These data indicate that IKKβ directly reduces
the stability and/or promotes the degradation of ΔNp63α.
To determine whether activation of IKK is required for the
reduction of endogenous ΔNp63α in response to cisplatin,
we examined the effect of silencing the expression of each
IKK subunit with expression vectors encoding either IKKβ
RNA interference (RNAi) or IKKα RNAi. As previously noted,
JHU-022 cells that were transfected with IKKβ expressed very
low levels of endogenous ΔNp63α; cotransfection of these
cells with the plasmid encoding IKKβ RNAi resulted in restoration of basal levels of ΔNp63α (Fig. 3A). In contrast to
IKKβ siRNA, no significant change in the stability of ΔNp63α
was observed in response to transfection with the IKKα RNAi
plasmid (Fig. 3A). To determine whether IKK is required for
the degradation of ΔNp63α in response to cisplatin, endogenous IKKβ or IKKα was knocked down with transfection of
the respective IKK RNAi plasmid. Inhibition of IKKβ expression by RNAi attenuated the degradation of ΔNp63α in response to cisplatin (Fig. 3B). In contrast, RNAi-mediated
knockdown of IKKα did not result in any significant impairment in the degradation of ΔNp63α in response to cisplatin

IKKβ and Stability of ΔNp63α

treatment of transfected cells with MG132 significantly attenuated IKKβ-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α (Fig. 4A). These
data suggested that the reduction of ΔNp63α by IKKβ may
involve proteasome-mediated degradation. To directly assess
whether IKKβ reduces the stability of ΔNp63α protein, we
analyzed the effect of expressing either IKKβ or its kinasedeficient mutant (IKKβ-K44A) on the half-life of ΔNp63α in
JHU-022 cells. Cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding ΔNp63α and an expression vector encoding either IKKβ or
IKKβ-K44A and then exposed to cycloheximide at 24 hours
following transfection. Immunoblot analysis of ΔNp63α at
serial time intervals showed that expression of IKKβ decreased the half-life of ΔNp63α (Fig. 4B); however, expression

of the kinase-deficient mutant IKKβ-K44A did not exhibit a
corresponding effect on the stability of ΔNp63α (Fig. 4B). To
confirm the effect of IKKβ on the half-life of ΔNp63α, JHU-022
cells were transfected with a control vector or IKKβ RNAi
vector and exposed to cycloheximide 24 hours following
transfection. Immunoblot analysis of ΔNp63α at serial time
points showed that in the IKKβ silencing by RNAi prolongs
the half-life of ΔNp63α (Fig. 4C).
Because IKKβ interacts with ΔNp63α and promotes its
kinase-dependent degradation, we next investigated whether
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in this process.
JHU-022 cells were cotransfected with Flag-ΔNp63α and Ub-HA

of an expression vector encoding either Flag-IKKβ, Flag-IKKβK44A, Flag-IKKα, or Flag-IKKαK44M. At 36 hours following
transfection, cells were treated with MG132 for 10 hours. Cell
lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA matrix and
subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes ΔNp63α. Expression of IKKβ resulted in a dosedependent elevation of the ubiquitination of ΔNp63α protein
(Fig. 4D, compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, no
significant change in the ubiquitination levels of ΔNp63α
was observed in response to expression of either IKKβK44A,
IKKα, or IKKαK44M (Fig. 4D). These data show that IKKβ promotes kinase-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
ΔNp63α.
IKKβ counteracts ΔNp63α-mediated repression of p53dependent transactivation. ΔNp63 proteins compete with
p53, TAp73, or TAp63 for DNA target sites and form transactivation-incompetent heterocomplexes with them (3, 19). As
such, ΔNp63 acts as a dominant negative that counteracts
the function of transactivating p53 family members (20).
Because IKKβ promoted the ubiquitin-mediated degradation

1424

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

of ΔNp63α, this raised the possibility that IKKβ may
enhance p53-dependent transactivation of genes. We investigated the effect of expressing ΔNp63α on the transactivation
of two established p53-inducible target genes: p21(WAF1/
CIP1) and BAX. Forced expression of ΔNp63α via introduction of the ΔNp63α expression plasmid resulted in a significant reduction of the activity of Bax and p21WAF1 reporter
plasmids in JHU-022 cells (Fig. 5A). However, cotransfection
of an expression vector encoding IKKβ counteracted the repression of either promoter by ΔNp63α (Fig. 5A). In contrast,
forced expression of TAp63α, alone or in combination with
IKKβ, did not affect the activity of either the Bax or the
p21WAF1 reporter plasmids (Fig. 5A).
As previously noted, JHU-022 cells that were transfected
with the IKKβ expression plasmid expressed very low levels
of endogenous ΔNp63α; forced overexpression of IKKβ in
these cells resulted in the increased expression of endogenous
p21 and BAX (Fig. 5B). We further examined the effect of
cotransfecting JHU-022 with an expression vector encoding
either ΔNp63α or TAp63α in combination with or without

the expression vector encoding IKKβ. Consistent with their
respective effects on the activity of Bax and p21WAF1 reporter
plasmids, forced expression of ΔNp63α, but not TAp63α, led
to a decrease in the expression of endogenous p21and Bax proteins (Fig. 5C). Forced expression of ΔNp63α continued to suppress the expression of endogenous p21 and Bax even in the
presence of coexpressed exogenous TAp63α (Fig. 5C). However,
coexpression of IKKβ with ΔNp63α restored the endogenous
expression of both p21 and Bax (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the
ability of ΔNp63α to repress the transactivation of endogenous
proapoptotic genes by p53 family members, JHU-022 cells transfected with ΔNp63α, with or without coexpression of exogenous
TAp63α, did not exhibit any appreciable activation of caspase-9
or induction of cell death after 24 hours (ΔNp63α = 1.33%;

ΔNp63α with TAp63α = 1.47%; Fig. 5D). However, transfection
of JHU-022 cells with an expression vector encoding IKKβ promoted the activation of caspase-9 and induction of apoptosis
(IKKβ = 8.76%; Fig. 5D). These data confirm the ability of
ΔNp63α to repress the transactivating function of p53 family
members and show that IKKβ-mediated degradation of
ΔNp63α can counteract this process and enhance transactivation of genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage.

Discussion
Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation
of proto-oncogenes that control cell proliferation and survival in response to cellular stress are key determinants of

IKKβ and Stability of ΔNp63α

the response of human tumors to commonly used genotoxic
anticancer agents. p53 is a prototypic tumor suppressor that
plays an instrumental role in the induction of cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. These functions
ensure the maintenance of genomic integrity in proliferating
cell compartments and prevent the propagation of genetic
errors that lead to tumor progression (21). Although p53 mutations are common in diverse types of cancer, including
HNSCCs, the other p53 family members, p63 and p73, are
also critical determinants of the progression and therapeutic
response of various malignancies (22, 23). In addition to p63
and p73 isotypes capable of transactivating downstream
target gene expression (TA isotypes), both genes also express dominant-negative inhibitory isoforms (ΔN isotypes)
that counteract p53 or TA isotypes (24, 25). ΔNp63α can
inhibit the activity of p53, TAp73, or TAp63 by a variety of
mechanisms, including competitive interaction with similar
cis elements in downstream gene target promoters (26).
Amplification and overexpression of ΔNp63α is the most
common oncogenic event in primary HNSCC (1). Specific
amplification of p63 is also observed in over half of all squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, supporting its frequent
involvement in common squamous cell carcinomas (27).
ΔNp63 induces proliferation and growth of tumor cells
in vitro and in vivo and leads to β-catenin–increased accumulation and signaling (28). Conversely, RNAi knockdown
of ΔNp63α from malignant cells overexpressing this oncogenic protein results in cell death, accompanied by cleavage
of the poly(ADP)-ribosylating enzyme PARP-1 (29). Inhibition
of endogenous ΔNp63α by lentivirus RNAi in HNSCC cells
induces the expression of proapoptotic genes Puma and
Noxa, suggesting that ΔNp63α is required for cell survival
(26). Induction of these genes following knockdown of
ΔNp63α by RNAi requires transactivation of p73 isoforms,
suggesting that the elevation of endogenous ΔNp63α in
HNSCC promotes survival through direct repression of p73dependent transcription of proapoptotic genes. As such,
ΔNp63α can promote tumorigenesis through direct protein-protein interactions in key proliferative pathways, direct
regulation of target genes, or inhibition of the transactivation
activity of other members of the p53 family.
HNSCCs are usually treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiation (30). p53 is stabilized and upregulated in response to DNA damage induced by radiation or
chemotherapeutic agents (31). Because p53 is a key determinant of cell fate in response to these agents, the frequent loss
or inactivation of p53 in human cancers may contribute to

resistance to therapy (32, 33). However, many studies have
failed to show a direct correlation between p53 mutational
status and favorable patient response to chemotherapy. This
has turned attention to the role of the other p53 family members in the regulation of HNSCC cell death following chemotherapy. Whereas posttranslational modifications of TAp73
lead to TAp73 activation following DNA damage (34),
ΔNp63α is degraded in response to DNA-damaging agents
(11–13). This degradation of ΔNp63α could augment p53,
TAp73, and TAp63 function, thereby enabling or facilitating
an effective cellular response to genotoxic agents (22). Consistent with this scenario, p63 levels have been found to correlate with patient response to cisplatin-based treatment
(35). This suggests that tumor cell death following DNA
damage involves the upregulation of p53 family members
and activation of their transactivating function via degradation of ΔNp63α. For head and neck cancers overexpressing
ΔNp63α, downregulation of ΔNp63α in response to DNA
damage may be required for maximal activation of TAcompetent p53 family proteins and a favorable response of
patients to treatment (35–37). Therefore, the critical molecular signal(s) responsible for reduction of ΔNp63α in response to DNA damage may determine the response of
cancers to chemotherapeutic agents.
In this study, we identify a key molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of ΔNp63α expression in response to
extrinsic stimuli, such as chemotherapeutic agents or TNF-α.
We show that ΔNp63α interacts with IKK, a multisubunit
protein kinase that consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKα
and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (NEMO; ref. 16).
We find that IKKβ kinase promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α. Cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced
stimulation of IKK leads to degradation of ΔNp63α and augments transactivation of p53 family–induced genes involved
in the cellular response to DNA damage. Conversely, inhibition
of IKKβ with a NEMO-binding peptide or siRNA-mediated silencing IKKβ expression attenuates cytokine- or chemotherapyinduced degradation of ΔNp63α. These data show that IKKβ
plays an essential role in downregulating ΔNp63α in response
to extrinsic stimuli, and suggest that it may be a key signal that
skews the dynamic balance between ΔNp63α and transactivating p53 family proteins (p53, TAp73, and TAp63) in response to genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.
Our findings may also shed light on how wild-type p53 is
differentially regulated in normal stem cells and their proliferating progeny. Whereas the most important attribute of
stem cells is their prolonged survival and relative resistance

Figure 5. IKKβ counteracts ΔNp63α-mediated repression of p53-dependent transactivation. A, JHU-022 cells were transfected with either p21 or Bax
luciferase promoter construct along with Renilla luciferase plasmid, with or without IKKβ and/or ΔNp63α or TAp63α, as indicated. The amount of DNA per
transfection was kept constant by using empty pCDNA3.1 vector. At 24 h after transfection, the luciferase activity was determined. The transfection
efficiency was standardized against Renilla luciferase. Results are representative of three independent experiments. *, P ≤ 0.001. B, JHU-022 cells were

the endogenous levels of the indicated proteins. C, JHU-022 cells were transfected with empty vector or expression vector encoding either TAp63α,
ΔNp63α, or IKKβ (alone or in combination with each other, as indicated), and the endogenous levels of p21 and Bax protein levels were assessed by
Western blotting. D, JHU-022 cells were transfected with either ΔNp63α, TAp63α, or IKKβ (alone or in combination with each other, as indicated) and
analyzed after 24 h for activation of caspase-9 (Western blot assay of caspase-9 cleavage product) and induction of apoptosis (measured using
Annexin V/propidium iodide staining).

to genotoxic insults, the proliferating cells derived from them
must become susceptible to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in
response to DNA damage (38). Recent studies suggest
that p63 may play a critical role in modulating p53 or
TAp73 function in the stem cell compartment (39, 40). The
ΔNp63α isoform is constitutively expressed in the stem cell
compartment of many epithelial tissues, and p63-deficient
embryos fail to develop and maintain multilayered, regenerative epithelia (9, 10). The essential role of p63 in the survival
of epithelial stem cells may be related to the ability of
ΔNp63α to act as a dominant negative that counteracts
p53 and TAp73 activity (24, 25, 41). As such, growth factor–
mediated or cytokine-mediated differentiation of stem cells
into the proliferating cell compartment must be coupled to
a reduction of ΔNp63α in order for transactivation-competent
p53 family members to serve as effective sentinels and guardians of genomic integrity. Our findings suggest that the activation of IKK may be a shared mechanism by which levels
of ΔNp63α are reduced during growth factor–mediated or
cytokine-mediated recruitment of stem cells into the prolifer-

ating cell compartment, thereby rendering them susceptible
to p53-mediated cell cycle arrest/death in the face of cellular
stress or DNA damage. However, proliferating tumor cells may
circumvent the effects of the constitutive activation of IKK by
either amplification of p63 or inactivating mutations in p53,
thereby allowing them to resist elimination by genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.
