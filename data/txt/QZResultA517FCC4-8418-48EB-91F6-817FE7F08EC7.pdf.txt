BACKGROUND. The authors investigated whether ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2
genetic polymorphisms affect pharmacokinetics (PK) of irinotecan and treatment
outcome of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Blood samples from 107 NSCLC patients treated with irinotecan and
cisplatin chemotherapy were used for genotyping ABCB1 (1236C > T, 2677G > T/
A, 3435C > T), ABCC2 (24C > T, 1249G > A, 3972C > T), and ABCG2 (34G > A,
421C > A) polymorphisms. Genotypes were correlated with irinotecan-PK, toxicity, tumor response, and survival.

RESULTS. Among 8 polymorphisms, 3435TT and 2677TT were associated with
AUCSN-38G and CLSN-38G. When haplotypes are assigned, 2677TT/3435TT carriers
showed significantly lower AUCSN-38G (P ¼ .006), whereas 2677GG/3435CC carriers showed significantly higher AUCSN-38 (P ¼ .039). These findings suggest that
2677TT and 3435TT variants are associated with higher efflux activity. In toxicity,
the 2677G/T or A was associated with grade 4 neutropenia. The 2677GG carriers
showed significantly lower absolute neutrophil count during the 1st cycle
(P ¼ .012) as well as entire course of chemotherapy (P ¼ .042). The 3435TT was
associated with higher frequency of grade 3 diarrhea (P ¼ .047). In tumor
response, ABCC2 24TT and 3972TT genotypes were associated with higher
response rates (P ¼ .031 and .046, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (P ¼ .035 and .038, respectively), which was sustained in haplotype analysis.

CONCLUSIONS. Specific polymorphisms of ABCB1 and ABCC2 can influence disposition and tumor response to irinotecan by regulating transporter activity.
These findings may help to individualize irinotecan-based chemotherapy in
patients with advanced NSCLC.

T

he adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are the largest superfamily of transmembrane proteins
that use ATP-derived energy to transport various substances over
cell membrane. Their targeted localization in normal tissues appears
to influence the intestinal absorption and urinary or biliary excretion of many drugs.1 In addition, they play an important role in development of multidrug resistance by cancer cells.2,3 Among them,
P-glycoprotein (MDR1; ABCB1), the canalicular multispecific organic
anion transporter (c-MOAT; MRP2; ABCC2), and the breast cancer
resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2) are thought to be the most important transporters involved in transporting irinotecan and its

metabolites, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38)
and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G).4,5 Several allelic
variants of those genes are known to alter functional
activity, thereby contributing to interindividual differences in irinotecan metabolism. Consequently, they
may predispose patients who receive irinotecan to
variable toxicity and may influence the drug response.
The gene for ABCB1 is located on chromosome
7q21 and ABCB1 is expressed in kidney, liver, and
small intestine.6 A recent study using ABCB1 knockout mice demonstrated that the biliary recovery of
irinotecan was significantly lower in the ABCB1
knockout mice compared with wild-type, implicating
ABCB1’s role in biliary excretion of irinotecan.7 Of
more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), much attention has been focused on 3 commonly occurring SNPs, 1236C > T (exon 12), 2677G
> T/A (exon 21), and 3435C > T (exon 26), which
exist in strong linkage disequilibrium.8–12 A significant association between 1236C > T polymorphism
and exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 were reported
in 46 Caucasian patients.8 Patients with homozygous
1236T alleles had significantly higher area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of irinotecan
and SN-38 than those with heterozygous or wild-type
alleles. Zhou et al.9 showed that patients with 1 variant 3435C > T allele had higher peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of irinotecan than those with wild-type
in 29 Chinese patients. In addition, Sai et al.10 found
a significant association of ABCB1 haplotype*2,
which contains the 1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, and
3435C > T, with reduced renal clearance of irinotecan, SN-38, and APC in 49 Japanese cancer patients.
The gene for ABCC2 is located on chromosome
10q24 and ABCC2 is expressed in liver, kidney, and
small intestine. It also plays a primary role in biliary
excretion of organic anions and antitumor agents
including irinotecan and cisplatin.13,14 Among several
SNPs reported, 24C > T (promoter), 1249G > A
(exon 10), and 3972C > T (exon 28) were most frequently observed, and a significant linkage was
found between 24C > T and 3972C > T in established cell lines.14,15 Recently, a functional SNP in irinotecan pharmacokinetics has been found. Innocenti
et al.16 reported that 3972TT genotype was associated
with higher AUCs of irinotecan, APC, and SN-38G
compared with patients with TC or CC genotypes.
Although other SNPs have been studied, no significant effects have been found so far on irinotecan
pharmacokinetics or its toxicity.
The gene for ABCG2 (BCRP) is located on chromosome 4q22 and ABCG2 is prominently expressed
in placenta, small intestine, and liver.17 Several allelic

139

variants of ABCG2 have been identified and available
data suggest that some of them may alter the transporter function.18,19 In vitro studies have indicated
that SN-38 and SN-38G are very good substrate for
ABCG2.20,21 In addition, overexpression of ABCG2
may confer cancer cell resistance to irinotecan and
SN-38.22 To date, more than 40 SNPs have been discovered in promoter and in exon and intron
sequences. In 2 frequently occurring nonsynonymous
SNPs, 34G > A and 421C > A, with altered transporter function, sensitivity to several anticancer drugs
and disrupted protein expression have been identified.23,24
Given the relevance of ABC transporters in the
disposition of irinotecan, we postulated that some
genetic variants of these genes would influence toxicity and tumor responses in patients who were treated
with irinotecan-based chemotherapy by altering their
transporter-activity. By using DNA samples obtained
from a predefined group of Korean patients with
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who
were prospectively enrolled in 2 phase-2 irinotecan
plus cisplatin chemotherapy trials,25,26 we examined
the above hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Treatment
From September 2002 to June 2005, a total of 156
chemonaive patients with advanced NSCLC were
prospectively enrolled for irinotecan plus cisplatin
(IP) chemotherapy. Among them, 107 patients participated in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic
study. Eighty-one patients were treated with irinotecan 80 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 plus
cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 every
3 weeks25, while 26 patients were treated with irinotecan 65 mg/m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks.26
Patients were required to have 1) pathologically
confirmed stage IIIB with pleural effusion or stage IV
NSCLC, 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, 3) adequate organ
function determined by (i) hematology: absolute

Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
For pharmacokinetic analysis, 10 mL of venous blood
was taken into sodium heparinized evacuated tubes
on Day 1 of cycle 1 before irinotecan infusion, and at
30, 60, 65, 75, 90, 105 minutes and 2, 3, 5, 7, 25 hours
after the start of irinotecan infusion. Total plasma
concentrations (ie, the total of lactone and carboxylate) of irinotecan and its metabolites SN-38, and
SN-38G were determined by reversed-phase, highperformance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, by using a modification of a procedure described previously.27 Individual plasma
concentrations of irinotecan and metabolites were
analyzed by using noncompartmental methods as
implemented in the computer software program
WinNonlin version 4.0 (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain
View, Calif). The dose-normalized AUC values, from
Time 0 to time of last measurable concentration,
were obtained after normalization of irinotecan dose
to 80 mg/m2.
ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2 Genotyping Assay
Genomic DNA was isolated before chemotherapy by
using a DNA purification kit (Gentra, Minn; now
available through Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). The

Statistical Analysis
All pharmacokinetic data are presented as the
mean  SD (standard deviation of the mean). Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters among genotypes were assessed by a nonparametric KruskalWallis test. When the Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a
significant effect of genotype (P <.05), Mann-Whitney
U test with Bonferroni correction was used as posthoc analysis and P < .017 was considered statistically
significant for multiple pairwise comparisons. The
association between potential variables was assessed
by using chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, or Mann-Whitney U or KruskalWallis test for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier
estimates and the log-rank test were used in univariate analyses of overall survival. Statistical analyses
were performed by using SPSS, and 2-sided P-values
<.05 were considered significant. The genotype frequencies for each SNP were checked for consistency
between observed values and those expected from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by using Haploview
(Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; available at
http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview) version
3.11. Haplotype frequencies were estimated by using
Haploview version 2.05.

population. All genotyped variants were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium (P > .05). We also analyzed the

to treatment schedule. However, no significant difference was observed.
Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) among
polymorphisms was determined by the expectation
maximization algorithm. Among the 3 ABCB1 SNPs
at positions 1236, 2677, and 3435, a significant
genetic linkage was observed (P < .0001). In ABCC2
SNPs, significant linkage was detected between positions 24 and 3972 (P <.0001), but there was no linkage between positions 1249 and 24 or 3972. Two
ABCG2 SNPs at positions 34 and 421 also showed
significant linkage (P ¼ .001).

Association of Genotype With Irinotecan
Pharmacokinetics
Table 4 summarizes the genotype-irinotecan pharmacokinetic associations. The mean AUC and clearance (CL) values of SN-38G were differed by the

3435C > T and 2677G > T genotypes. Patients with
3435TT showed significantly lower AUC (P ¼ .01) and
higher CL (P ¼ .011) of SN-38G than other genotypes.
Patients with 2677TT also showed a trend for lower
AUC (P ¼ .055) and higher CL (P ¼ .054) of SN-38G.
These findings suggest that 3435TT and 2677TT variants may be associated with higher efflux activity.
No statistically significant difference was observed in
other variants.
With regard to the effect of 2677G > T and
3435C > T SNPs on irinotecan and its metabolites
disposition, we analyzed the haplotypes by using
these 2 SNPs (Table 5). Of the 43 subjects with
3435CC, 16 (37%) accompanied 2677GG, and 9 (82%)
of 11 subjects with 3435TT accompanied 2677TT. The
variant A-allele at the position 2677 tended to be
accompanied by the C-allele at the position 3435,
whereas the variant T-allele variant tended to be

AUCSN-38G than heterozygous or absence of this haplotype (P ¼ .003; post-hoc analysis, Fig. 1 [left]). Conversely, patients with homozygous 2677G/3435C
showed significantly higher AUCSN-38 (P ¼ .013, posthoc analysis, Fig. 1 [right]) and a trend of increasing
AUCIrinotecan (P ¼ .068; data not shown) than the absence of this haplotype. These findings support that
2677G > T and 3435C > T polymorphisms may be
functionally important to determine the efflux activity.

FIGURE 1. Dose-normalized AUCs of SN-38G (left) and SN-38 (right) as a function of ABCB1 2677G/T and 3435C>T genotypes are shown. The box represents the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the horizontal line inside the box represents the median. Group data were compared by using
the Kruskal-Wallis analysis (PKW). Bonferroni adjustment was performed to determine the level of significance. *P-value was obtained by post hoc analysis by
the Mann-Whitney test.

Association With Toxicity and Delivered
Dose of Irinotecan
We examined the association of genotypes with the
toxicity for all 107 patients enrolled. The most common severe toxicity was National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 4 neutropenia, which occurred in 26 patients (22 [27%]
patients in the 80 mg/m2 group vs 4 [15%] patients in
the 65 mg/m2 group; P ¼ .297). Patients with 2677GG,
which was associated with increased AUCSN-38, developed higher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia
(P ¼ .03; Table 6). The 2677GG carriers showed significantly lower absolute neutrophil count during the 1st
cycle and throughout the entire course of chemotherapy (P ¼ .012 and .042, respectively; data not shown).
Grade 3 diarrhea developed in 11 patients (8 [9%] in
the 80 mg/m2 group vs 3 [11%] in the 65 mg/m2
group; P ¼ .726). Patients with 3435TT, which was
associated with lower AUCSN-38G, had a higher inci-

dence of grade 3 diarrhea (P ¼ .047, Table 6). Because
some variants examined in this study were associated
with a higher incidence of severe toxicity, we analyzed
the association of each genotype with the actual delivered dose of irinotecan (mg/m2/week). However, there
was no significant difference (Table 6).

Association With Tumor Response and Survival
Of the 107 patients enrolled, 103 were assessable for
response and 48 patients (36 [44%] in the 80 mg/m2
group vs 12 [46%] in the 65 mg/m2 group, P ¼ 1.0)
achieved partial responses (PR).27 By genotypes,
patients with ABCC2 24T and 3435T genotypes
showed a significantly higher tumor response rate
(P ¼ .031 and 0.048, respectively; Table 6). We also
examined the effect of haplotypes on the tumor
response to IP chemotherapy. Only patients with
24C/3435C or 24T/3435T were associated with tumor response rates. Patients with 24T/3972T were

associated with higher tumor response rates than absence of this haplotype (24 of 38 [63%] vs 24 of 65
[36%], P ¼ .014), whereas, those with homozygous
24C/3972C were associated with lower tumor
response rates than heterozygous or absence of this
haplotype (12 of 38 [31%] vs 36 of 65 [55%];
P ¼ .025).
Likewise the association of genotypes with tumor
response rates, the ABCC2 24C > T and 3972C > T
were associated with progression-free survival (PFS).
Patients with 24TT or 3435TT showed significantly
longer progression-free survival (P ¼ .010 and .019,
respectively; Fig. 2). When haplotypes were analyzed,
patients with homozygous 24T/3435T showed sig-

nificantly longer PFS than heterozygous or absence
of this haplotype (P ¼ .036). Whereas, patients with
at least 1 24C/3435C showed a significantly shorter
PFS than those without this haplotype (P ¼ .03).

DISCUSSION
Irinotecan has a wide interpatient variability in PK and
subsequent pharmacologic effects and toxicity. This
variability in PK has been mainly explained by the
genetic polymorphisms of hepatic metabolizing
enzymes such as uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1. Particularly, the UGT1A1*28
polymorphism, characterized by an extra TA repeat in

ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2 Polymorphisms in NSCLC/Han et al.

145

FIGURE 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) according to ABCC2 24C>T (left) or 3972C>T (right) genotypes. Patients with 24TT
(left) or 3435TT (right) genotypes had significantly longer PFS than patients with CT or CC genotypes (P ¼ .010 and .019, respectively).

the promoter region of the gene [A(TA)7TAA] is
believed to be associated with reduced glucuronidation activity and subsequently higher incidence of
severe toxicities of neutropenia and late-onset diarrhea.28 Meanwhile, a mutation in exon 1 (a G to A transition termed UGT1A1*6) is more prevalent in East
Asian populations with an allele frequency of approximately 12%, which reduces catalytic function by 60%
in homozygotes.29 Previously, we had reported the
impact of this polymorphism on reduced glucuronidation activity, severe neutropenia, and poor prognosis
in Korean patients treated with irinotecan and cisplatin for advanced NSCLC.30
Besides UGT1A1, drug transporters have also
been implicated in the disposition of irinotecan and
its metabolites with evidence that ABC transporters
such as ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2 are involved in
biliary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites.
Therefore, the accurate prediction of irinotecan-PK
and its toxicity needs to consider genetic variations
in not only UGT1A1 but also in its transporters.
Previously, great attention was brought to the
ABCB1 3435C > T because of its suppressive effect
on MDR1 protein expression and function.31 However, there are still discrepancies in the results on the
3435C > T. Recent investigations suggest that 3435C
> T has no effect on placental MDR1 expression.32,33
Moreover, the 3435C > T is related to a higher MDR1
mRNA expression in duodenal biopsies in healthy
Japanese,34 and subjects with 3435TT genotype are
related with lower concentration of several drugs.35,36
These findings suggest that the effects of this poly-

morphism remain unclear, and further investigations
would be needed to elucidate these discrepancies. In
our study, the 3435TT was associated with significantly lower AUCSN-38G levels than CC or CT genotypes (P ¼ .007 and .002, respectively; post-hoc
analysis). It also showed a decreasing tendency of
AUCIrinotecan (P ¼ .064). These findings suggest that
3435TT genotype may be related to higher MDR-1
activity. In addition, the 1236C > T has been
reported to be associated with increased AUCIrinotecan
and AUCSN-38 in 46 Caucasian patients.8 However, we
did not find any significant effect of 1236C > T on
irinotecan or its metabolites concentrations. Recent
data also suggest that the correlation between ABCB1
genotype and phenotype may not be explained solely
by 3435C > T or 1236C > T SNPs.36–38 Because these
SNPs are wobble polymorphisms, it is unlikely that
these synonymous SNPs alter protein levels and activity directly.37 Furthermore, 3435C > T and 1236C
> T are highly linked with the 2677G > T/A, a synonymous SNP in exon 21, which has been shown to be
correlated with MDR1 activity. Several studies have
reported that the 2677T variant exhibits enhanced
efflux activity.12,36,38 These results suggest that haplotype analysis may provide a rational explanation for
these discrepancies. In our study, 2677TT showed a
trend for reduced AUCSN-38G (P ¼ .055), and a significant linkage was observed between 2677G > T and
3435C > T (P<.0001). Thereafter, we analyzed effects
of haplotypes on irinotecan pharmacokinetics by
using these 2 SNPs. As expected, patients with the
homozygous 2677T/3435T were associated with lower

146

CANCER

AUCSN-38G, whereas, those with the homogenous
2677G/3435C were associated with higher AUCSN-38.
These findings further support the functional importance of 2677G > T and 3435C > T polymorphisms
in determining transporter activity.
Because ABCC2 protein is responsible for the
export of conjugated drugs from hepatocytes, interindividual variations in expression level or activity may
be important for irinotecan pharmacokinetics.13,14
Recently, functional activity of the 3972C > T SNP in
exon 28 on the AUCs of irinotecan, APC, and SN-38G
has been found in 64 Caucasian patients.16 However,
the 3972C > T is a silent mutation at 1324, thus, the
3972C > T polymorphism alone does not seem to alter the protein levels or activity directly. Recently
Kroetz et al.39 showed no haplotype-specific mRNA
expression discriminated by the 3972C > T polymorphism in 200 human liver samples. Whereas,
Haenisch et al.38 reported that 24T is associated
with lower mRNA levels in normal renal tissues and
with reduced activity in a reporter gene assay. In our
study, we did not find any statistically significant
association of 3972C > T, 1249G > A, or 24C > T
with AUC itself. However, the 24TT genotype
appears to be related with increased AUCSN-38 and
AUCSN-38G as well as with the 3972TT (Table 5). In
addition, 24TT genotype was associated with higher
(SN-381SN-38G)/Irinotecan AUC ratios than CT or
CC genotypes (P ¼ .035; data not shown), thus suggesting lower efflux activity. In agreement with other
reports,14,15 significant linkage was found between
24C > T and 3972C > T (P<.0001), but there was
no linkage between 1249G > A and 24C > T or
3972C > T. These findings suggest that the 24C > T
associated with 3972C > T may be involved in regulation of the ABCC2 protein and its activity.
Beside the effect on drug disposition, ABCC2 is
believed to contribute to drug resistance of cancer
chemotherapy.2,3 Human ABCC2 cDNA was originally
isolated from a cisplatin-resistant human cancer cell
line, thus suggesting that it can provide resistance to
cisplatin.40 In our study, 24TT and 3972TT variants
were associated with higher tumor response rates
(P ¼ .031 and .048, respectively) and longer PFS
(P ¼ .035 and .038, respectively). These results are
concordant with the haplotype analysis and suggest
that 24T and 3972T variants may be associated with
lower expression of ABCC2 protein, which may result
in less tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
The ABCG2 protein is an ABC transporter with
wide substrate specificity. Two frequently occurring
nonsynonymous SNPs, 34G > A and 421C > A, with
altered transport function, sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic drugs, and disrupted protein expres-

sion have been identified lately.17–19 On the contrary,
de Jong et al.41 found no significant changes in irinotecan pharmacokinetics relative to the 421C > A
polymorphism in 88 Caucasian cancer patients. Likewise, we did not find any significant correlation
between these polymorphisms and irinotecan pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes.
In summary, the results of our study indicated
that some commonly occurring polymorphisms in
ABCB1 and ABCC2 may be important for disposition
of irinotecan and its metabolites and resulting toxicity and/or tumor response. Therefore, the stratification of NSCLC patients, receiving irinotecan plus
cisplatin chemotherapy, based on these genotypes
may be helpful for decreasing adverse effects and
improving tumor responses. To confirm data
observed in the present study, further larger studies
are needed in an independent data set.
