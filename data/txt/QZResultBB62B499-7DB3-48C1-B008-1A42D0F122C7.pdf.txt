Abstract
Use of short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising new
approach thought to have a strong potential to lead to rapid
development of gene-oriented therapies. Here, we describe a
newly developed, systemically injectable siRNA vehicle, the
‘‘wrapsome’’ (WS), which contains siRNA and a cationic
lipofection complex in a core that is fully enveloped by a
neutral lipid bilayer and hydrophilic polymers. WS protected
siRNA from enzymatic digestion, providing a long half-life in
the systemic circulation. Moreover, siRNA/WS leaked from
blood vessels within tumors into the tumor tissue, where it
accumulated and was subsequently transfected into the tumor
cells. Because the transcription factor KLF5 is known to play a
role in tumor angiogenesis, we designed KLF5-siRNA to test
the antitumor activity of siRNA/WS. KLF5-siRNA/WS exhibited
significant antitumor activity, although neither WS containing
control scrambled-siRNA nor saline containing KLF5-siRNA
affected tumor growth. KLF5-siRNA/WS inhibited Klf5 expression within tumors at both mRNA and protein levels,
significantly reducing angiogenesis, and we detected no
significant acute or long-term toxicity. Our findings support
the idea that siRNA/WS can be used to knock down specific
genes within tumors and thereby exert therapeutic effects
against cancers. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6531–8]

Introduction
Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is an attractive technology that
has the potential to effectively suppress expression of selected
genes, including genes with products that are not considered to be
practical drug targets (e.g., transcription factors). However,
achievement of effective gene knockdown in vivo requires highly
efficient delivery of siRNA to target tissues (1). For efficient delivery
of siRNA and therapeutic gene knockdown, a drug delivery system
needs to (a) protect the siRNA from degradation, (b) suppress
nonspecific uptake by nontarget tissues, and (c) mediate accumulation of siRNA within the target tissues and cells.
Cationic lipids and polymers are two major classes of nonviral
siRNA delivery carriers that have been tested; both are positively
charged and form complexes with negatively charged siRNA (1, 2).

In general, these carriers have a high electric charge density on
their surface, which causes nonspecific interactions with proteins
in the blood and endothelium, resulting in their rapid removal from
the systemic circulation (3). In addition, in many carriers, the
siRNA is exposed to the outside and is therefore susceptible to
degradation by serum proteins. Furthermore, positively charged
complexes may induce embolization by forming aggregates with
blood proteins (4). To overcome the problems associated with
existing cationic carriers, a delivery system that provides physical
containment of the siRNA and inhibits nonspecific electrostatic
interactions with blood proteins and the endothelium would be
desirable.
Assuming that its half-life could be lengthened, another
important hurdle would be transporting the siRNA to the target
tissue. It is well documented that the higher permeability of tumor
blood vessels, coupled with poor lymphatic drainage, enhances
retention of macromolecules such as nanoparticles within tumors
(the EPR effect; refs. 5–7). This could potentially enable selective
accumulation of drugs and other bioactive molecules within
tumors; however, the EPR effect is only observed with stabilized
macromolecules, and efficient tumor uptake requires long systemic
residence times (8). The size of macromolecules is also known to
greatly affect the efficacy of the EPR effect (9).
In the present study, we describe the ‘‘wrapsome’’ (WS), which is
based on our previously developed nanoparticle technology (10)
and was developed with the aim of making use of the EPR effect to
transport native siRNA to target tumors following systemic
administration. We found that, when systemically administered
via the tail vein, wrapsomal siRNA (siRNA/WS) accumulated in s.c.
tumors, and the siRNA was taken up by the tumor cells. The
resultant siRNA/WS-mediated knockdown of the transcription
factor KLF5 suppressed both angiogenesis within tumors and
tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
siRNA preparation. KLF5-siRNA and fluorescence-labeled KLF5-siRNA
was synthesized and purified by Hokkaido System Science. The sequences of
siRNA were KLF5-siRNA: AAGCUCACCUGAGGACUCATT (sense) and
UGAGUCCUCAGGUGAGCUUTT (antisense; ref. 11), KLF5-siRNA#2: GCAUCAACAUGAACGUCUU and AAGACGUUCAUGUUGAUGCUG, secreted human alkaline phosphatase gene (12)-siRNA: AGGGCAACUUCCAGACCAUTT
and AUGGUCUGGAAGUUGCCCUTT, scrambled-siRNA: GGUACACAUGUGCACACACTT and GUGUGUGCACAUGUGUACCTT, and luciferase-siRNA:
CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT and UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGTT (13).
Preparation of wrapsomes. Sixty milligrams of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 24 mg of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N -(polyethylene glycol-2000) (PEG-DSPE) were

hydrated in 2.5 mL distilled water and extruded 20 times through two
polycarbonate membrane filters with pore sizes of 0.4 and 0.1 Am
(LiposoFast; Avestin). The resultant suspensions were mixed with 1.25 mL
distilled water containing 10 mg siRNA, which formed complexes with the
DOTAP and PEG-DSPE. An aliquot of the solution containing the complexes
(0.75 mL) was then diluted with 1 mL ethanol and added to 0.25 mL of an
ethanol solution containing 96 mg/mL egg phosphatidylcholine (egg-PC)
and 20 mg/mL PEG-DSPE. In the resultant suspension, the concentration of
ethanol was 62.5% (v/v); siRNA, 1.0 mg/mL; DOTAP, 6.0 mg/mL; PEG-DSPE,
2.4 mg/mL; egg-PC, 12 mg/mL; and PEG-DSPE, 2.5 mg/mL. Twenty-three
milliliters of distilled water were then slowly added to this suspension while
stirring to dilute the ethanol to 5% (v/v), after which the suspension was
centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000  g, and the supernatant was removed to
eliminate the ethanol completely. Less than 10% of the siRNA was detected
in the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in PBS to provide a
preparation containing 24 mg/mL egg-PC, and PEG-DSPE in ethanol (4%,

v/v) was added to a final egg-PC/PEG-DSPE ratio of 24:14.8 (w/w). The
mixture was then heated for 2 min at 70jC, and the particle size of the
resultant wrapsomes was measured based on dynamic light scattering.
Cell culture. Mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LL/2; American Type
Culture Collection) and human prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3; American
Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum without antibiotics.
Evaluation of siRNA stability against nuclease. One nanomole of
siRNA/WS or siRNA in saline solution was incubated with 0.2 IU RNase A
(Qiagen). The siRNA was then extracted and separated on 15% TBE-urea
gels (Invitrogen).
Animal experiments. All experiments were approved by Ethics
Committees for Animal Experiments of the University of Tokyo and Kyowa
Hakko Kirin and strictly adhered to the guidelines for animal experiments.
Measurement of blood clearance. Male 5-week-old C57BL/6jjcl mice
(CLEA Japan) were administered a single injection of FAM-labeled KLF5siRNA/WS (50 Ag siRNA/100 AL; n = 3), and their plasma was collected at
various time points thereafter. FAM fluorescence intensities were measured
in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 using an ARVO system (Perkin-Elmer),
after which blood concentrations of siRNA and its half-life in the circulation
were calculated (WinNonlin; Pharsight).
Cy5 dye was synthesized from Cy5-amidite (Pharmacia Biotech). The
protection groups on Cy5-amidite were removed, after which the chemical
structure was identified using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and mass
spectrometry. Cy5 dye was mixed with the same lipid components that
comprise the WS envelope and then extruded through a polycarbonate
membrane (100 nm pore) 20 times in saline. Liposome-encapsulated Cy5
was isolated and administered to mice as described above.
Whole-body near-infrared imaging of Cy5-siRNA. The distribution of
Cy5-siRNA in the bodies of mice and its accumulation in tumors following
systemic administration was analyzed noninvasively using an IVIS imaging
system 200 (Xenogen). Male 5-week-old BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu mice were
purchased from CLEA Japan. LL/2 cells (1  106) or PC-3 cells (1  106) in
100 AL DMEM were inoculated s.c. into their backs and grown until the
tumor volume was f200 mm3. The mice were then given a single injection
of saline solution or WS formulation containing 10 Ag Cy5-labeled KLF5siRNA in a 100 AL volume via the tail vein. Cy5 fluorescence was then
monitored for up to 72 h (LL/2) or 2 weeks (PC-3) after administration.
Total photon flux in the tumor tissue was quantified by analyzing regions of
interest using image analysis software (Xenogen).
Fluorescence confocal microscopy. A confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 Meta; Carl Zeiss) equipped with 10 dry and 100 oil
objectives was used to collect tissue images. Mice were given a single
injection of saline solution or WS formulation containing 10 Ag Cy5-labeled
KLF5-siRNA in a 100 AL volume via the tail vein. To visualize the vasculature
24 h later, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 30 min after
intravascular injection of FITC-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin
GS-IB4 (50 Ag for each mouse; Vector Laboratories). Thereafter, the tumor
and surrounding s.c. tissues were removed, washed, and incubated with
Hoechst 33342 (40 Amol/L; Molecular Probes) for 15 min at room
temperature. The tissue was then excited using multiple color laser lines
(405 nm for Hoechst, 488 nm for isolectin with FITC, and 643 nm for Cy5),
and the emission was collected through appropriate narrow band-pass
filters.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Flow cytometry
(Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter) was used to evaluate the
incorporation of siRNA into cells. Mice bearing LL/2 tumors were
administered a single injection of saline solution or WS formulation
containing 150 Ag Cy5-labeled KLF5-siRNA in a 100 AL volume via the tail
vein. Twenty-four hours later, the tumor tissues were harvested and
treated with 0.2% (w/v) collagenase D in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4)
for 30 min at 37jC. After removing the cell aggregates by filtration,
isolated cells were analyzed for Cy5-siRNA fluorescence using a flow
cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon ion laser. Mice administered
saline served as a negative control.
Analysis of tumor growth. In the syngeneic model, LL/2 cells (1  106)
in 100 AL DMEM were inoculated s.c. into the backs of male 5-week-old

from the following experiments. For LL/2 tumors, WS particles containing
KLF5-siRNA or scrambled-siRNA (50 Ag/head) were administered into the
tail veins daily from days 2 to 8. For PC-3 tumors, WS particles containing

followed until they reached 1,000 mm3, which was the ethically allowable
criterion for sacrifice (n = 10 in each group). This criterion was selected to
comply with institutional animal care committee protocols, as PC-3
xenografts were regarded as lethal when the tumor mass reached 1,000
mm3. For real-time PCR analysis, LL/2 tumors were collected 36 h after a
single administration of siRNA. For Western analysis, LL/2 tumors were
collected 24 h after a twice of daily administration of siRNA.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor samples were fixed in 95% methanol
and embedded in paraffin. CD31 was immunolabeled with anti-CD31
antibody (Pharmingen), after which the samples were incubated for 60 min
at ambient temperature with anti-rat immunoglobulin biotinylated
antibody (1:200 dilution; Dako). Immunolocalization was accomplished
using a Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was purified using a RNeasy RNA isolation
kit (Qiagen). The methods for cDNA synthesis and semiquantitative realtime PCR were described previously (15). Real-time PCR was carried out
using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) and a QuantiTect SYBR Green
PCR kit (Qiagen; ref. 16). The gene-specific primer sequences were ( for
KLF5) 5¶-GGTTGCACAAAAGTTTATAC-3¶ and 5¶-GGCTTGGCGCCTGTGTGCTTCC-3¶.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium
lauryl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mmol/L DTT, and Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)], after which 10 Ag aliquots of protein
were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (16).
Statistical analysis. Differences in tumor growth were analyzed using
repeated-measures two-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey-Kramer
test. Comparisons between multiple growths were analyzed using ANOVA
followed by a post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, and comparisons between two
groups were made using Student’s t test. Survival among tumor-bearing
mice was analyzed using the log-rank test. P values < 0.05 were considered
significant.

WS efficiently mediates accumulation of siRNA in tumors.
We next used near-infrared whole-body imaging to analyze the
distribution of Cy5-labeled siRNA after systemic administration.
We first eliminated the possibility that WS would itself stabilize
Cy5 dye in systemic circulation. We found that the fluorescent signal
from Cy5 dye incorporated into WS particles disappeared from
the systemic circulation within 10 min (Supplementary Fig. S3),
confirming that WS stabilizes siRNA molecules but not Cy5.
Mice bearing LL/2 tumors in their backs were administered a
single injection of Cy5-labeled siRNA/WS or naked siRNA into their

Results
WS improves the stability and prolongs the systemic halflife of siRNA. For introduction of siRNA into tumors, a WS was
designed with a core composed of a cationic lipid bilayer and
siRNA/transfection reagent complex enveloped in a neutral lipid
bilayer with PEG on the surface (Fig. 1A). We anticipated that this
design would physically contain the siRNA within the particle and
protect it from degradation by RNase and rapid dissociation from
the particle. As expected, WS protected siRNA from RNase
A–dependent degradation, and the incorporated siRNA remained
in its intact double-stranded form for 24 h (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S1). In sharp contrast, unprotected siRNA was degraded within
15 min.
WS particles were designed to be 100 nm in diameter to
maximize the EPR effect (9). The WS particles appeared
translucent in solution, and their size distribution was Gaussian,
with an average diameter of f100 nm (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, in the process of generating
WS particles, almost all of the added siRNA molecules are
incorporated into the inside of the outer lipid bilayer independently of the siRNA sequence (data not shown).
The mean zeta potential of WS particles was 0 mV, indicating
that they primarily carried a neutral surface charge (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). As expected from the protective effects of WS in vitro,
29% of the input dosage of siRNA was detected in the systemic
circulation 24 h after venous injection of siRNA/WS into mice, and
the plasma half-life of the siRNA/WS was calculated to be 17.6 h.
By contrast, siRNA administered in saline solution rapidly
disappeared from the circulation; its initial elimination half-life
was <4 min (Fig. 1C).

tail vein. Soon after the injection, fluorescence from both naked
Cy5-siRNA and Cy5-siRNA/WS was detected throughout the
animals’ bodies (Fig. 2A). After 12 h, however, the naked Cy5siRNA was mainly restricted to the kidneys and liver, and no
accumulation was detected within the tumor mass. At the same
time point, Cy5-siRNA/WS was still detected throughout the entire
body of the mice, and accumulation within the tumor was
apparent. Twenty-four hours after the injection, mice injected
with naked Cy5-siRNA showed fluorescence in the liver, bladder,
and kidneys, whereas fluorescence was found in a much broader
area in mice injected with Cy5-siRNA/WS, and the siRNA/WS had
continued to accumulate within the tumor mass (Fig. 2A). We
found that the accumulation of siRNA/WS peaked 24 h after its
administration and then gradually declined (Fig. 2B), although
significant fluorescence continued to be detected within the
tumors of siRNA/WS-injected mice 72 h after administration.
Because the rapid growth of LL/2 tumors did not allow for longer
observations, to further test the ability of WS to deliver siRNA to
tumors and to analyze the Cy5 signal for a longer period, Cy5siRNA/WS was injected into mice harboring s.c. tumors composed
of PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, which grow more
slowly than LL/2 tumors. We detected Cy5 fluorescence from PC-3
tumors, even 11 days after the injection (Fig. 2C).
We then confirmed the selective accumulation of siRNA/WS in
tumors by using radiolabeled siRNA to visualize its whole-body
distribution autoradiographically. Radioactivity was mainly detected
in the tumors, kidneys, and livers of mice injected with siRNA/WS
(Supplementary Fig. S4), but no accumulation of radioactivity was
found in the tumors of mice injected with naked siRNA.
To assess the distribution of Cy5-siRNA/WS within the tumor
mass in more detail, we next examined tumors using laser confocal

microscopy. siRNA was clearly detected outside of the blood
vessels, within the tumor tissue, following systemic administration
of WS/siRNA, whereas no siRNA signal was observed in the
tumors of mice administered naked Cy5-siRNA (Fig. 3A). Highmagnification images showed that fluorescence was present within
the majority of cells, most of which were considered to be tumor
cells, judging from their morphologies (Fig. 3B). Moreover, flow
cytometric analysis confirmed that cells of the tumor mass from
mice receiving Cy5-siRNA/WS contained higher levels of siRNA
fluorescence than cells from the mice receiving naked Cy5-siRNA in
saline (Fig. 3C).
KLF5-siRNA/WS exhibits antitumor activity. We recently
showed that angiogenesis was diminished in heterozygous
knockout mice of the Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor
KLF5 (Klf5+/ ) using tumor implantation and hind-limb ischemia
models (17). Notably, Klf5+/ mice still expressed KLF5 at levels
approximately half those seen in wild-type animals, suggesting that
moderate suppression of Klf5 expression is sufficient to inhibit
angiogenesis. As expected, knocking down Klf5 using siRNA
inhibited angiogenesis in Matrigel plug assays (Supplementary
Fig. S5). To further test whether KLF5-siRNA might inhibit
angiogenesis within tumors, we administered daily injections of
saline solution containing either control scrambled-siRNA or KLF5siRNA into tissues surrounding LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma tumors
implanted s.c. in the backs of mice. On histologic examination,
tumors treated with KLF5-siRNA tended to have fewer blood
vessels, particularly near the edge of the tumor mass (Supplementary Fig. S6), which suggests that KLF5-siRNA has the potential to
inhibit angiogenesis in vivo but that passive diffusion of siRNA
from surrounding tissues did not deliver sufficient numbers of
molecules into the tumor mass.

We then evaluated the antitumor effects of KLF5-siRNA/WS.
Beginning 2 days after inoculation of LL/2 cells, KLF5-siRNA/WS or
scrambled-siRNA/WS (50 Ag) was injected daily into the tail veins
of mice for 7 days. Alternatively, saline solutions of KLF5-siRNA or
scrambled-siRNA, or saline alone, were injected as a control.
Subsequent whole-body imaging confirmed that siRNA/WS
accumulated during the early stages of LL/2 tumor development
(f2 mm in diameter; Supplementary Fig. S7). Moreover, only
KLF5-siRNA/WS exhibited significant antitumor activity; neither

scrambled-siRNA/WS nor saline containing KLF5-siRNA affected
tumor growth (Fig. 4A). There were no significant differences in
body weight among the mice given the various siRNA formulations
(Fig. 4B), and no abnormalities of the liver, lung, or spleen were
detected on examination of their gross morphology and histology
(data not shown). We observed similar antitumor activity when we
tested a second siRNA sequence targeting Klf5 (Supplementary
Fig. S8), which lends further support the idea that tumor growth
can be suppressed using RNA interference against Klf5. Similarly,
KLF5-siRNA/WS also significantly inhibited the growth of
PC-3 cell tumors (Fig. 4C) and prolonged the time to tumor size
of 1,000 mm3 (Fig. 4D), indicating that the antitumor effects of
KLF5-siRNA/WS are not limited to LL/2.
When we analyzed the acute and chronic toxicities of KLF5siRNA/WS, we detected no signs of toxic effects on body weight or
the gross morphology of the major organs and hematologic
examination (Supplementary Table 1). By contrast, systemic
administration of the same dose of the unprotected complex of
transfection reagent (DOTAP) and siRNA was lethal (data not
shown), indicating that incorporation of the molecules into WS
also reduced their systemic toxicity. Only the total cholesterol
level was increased (KLF5-siRNA/WS 318 mg/dL versus control
146 mg/dL) in the mice administered with 20 mg/kg KLF5-siRNA/
WS once a day for 7 days. However, 4 mg/kg KLF5-siRNA/WS,
which is higher than the therapeutic dose used in the present study
(f2.5 mg/kg), did not increase the total cholesterol level.
KLF5-siRNA/WS down-regulates Klf5 expression and
inhibits tumor angiogenesis. Finally, we tested whether the
antitumor effect of KLF5-siRNA/WS could be attributable to
inhibition of Klf5 expression in vivo. Among all the formulations
administered, only KLF5-siRNA/WS inhibited Klf5 expression
within tumors at the mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein (Fig. 5B and C)
levels. Moreover, tumors from mice receiving KLF5-siRNA/WS
showed substantially reduced levels of angiogenesis on day 10 after
tumor implantation (Fig. 6A). The numbers of CD31+ cells were
significantly lower in KLF5-siRNA/WS-treated animals than in
those treated with saline solution or scrambled-siRNA/WS (Fig. 6B
and C). Thus, inhibition of KLF5 expression through WS-mediated
delivery of siRNA reduces tumor angiogenesis in vivo.

It is now widely recognized that efficient intracellular delivery of
siRNA to target sites in the body following systemic administration
is the most important hurdle that must be cleared before there can
be widespread use of siRNA in the clinic (2). The results of the
present study clearly show that incorporation into WS nanoparticles can markedly stabilize siRNA in the circulation following
systemic administration and enable its accumulation within
tumors, where it can exert RNA interference effects.
WS was specifically designed to enable systemic delivery of
siRNA. To inhibit the nonspecific interaction with the negatively
charged endothelial cell membrane and plasma proteins, and to
avoid entrapment by the reticuloendothelial system, the outer layer
is composed of neutral phospholipids and is PEGylated. PEGylation
of the outer layer was essential for accumulation of the WS
particles in tumors in vivo,7 suggesting that the long half-life in

circulation is one of the critical characteristics of WS for the overall
efficacy of target gene silencing in vivo. Moreover, the outer lipid
bilayer protects siRNA from degradation by enzymes in serum
(Fig. 1B). Consequently, the half-life of siRNA/WS was markedly
longer than that of naked siRNA (Fig. 1C). To our knowledge, WS is
the first liposomal siRNA delivery system that involves enveloping
siRNA with electrically neutral lipid molecules. To facilitate
accumulation within tumors via the EPR effect and to suppress
renal excretion and reticuloendothelial uptake, the diameter of WS
was set to be 100 nm (2, 18). With these properties, WS was capable
of delivering siRNA to target tumors following systemic administration in vivo (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S4). The siRNA delivered
by WS was taken up by the tumors (Fig. 3), where it exerted RNA
interference effects (Fig. 5) that inhibited tumor growth and
prolonged the time-to-progression (Fig. 4). Moreover, WS suppressed adverse effects otherwise seen with complexes of cationic
lipid and siRNA. The imaging methodologies used in the present
study cannot differentiate between intact and degraded forms of
siRNA molecules. However, the observed improvement in the
stability of the intact siRNA duplex in the WS formulation in vitro
and the knockdown of Klf5 within the tumor mass in vivo strongly
suggest that at least a part of duplex remained active for RNA
interference when delivered to the tumor using WS particles.
Moreover, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis
detected intact siRNA molecules in PC-3 tumors from mice
receiving siRNA/WS.8
The tolerability of a delivery system is also critical for its clinical
application. Mice given KLF5-siRNA/WS exhibited no signs of
significant toxicity in acute and long-term toxicologic tests. By
contrast, the siRNA-DOTAP complex was lethal at a dose that

showed no toxicity when incorporated into WS particles. Thus, the
WS formulation appears to inhibit nonspecific interactions with
cellular membranes and plasma proteins, thereby suppressing the
adverse effects of cationic lipids and polymers (e.g., acute
embolization and immune responses; ref. 4). Moreover, WS is
composed of constituents that are already being used clinically in
humans, which should facilitate introduction and trial of siRNA/
WS for clinical use.
In conclusion, our results show that the chemical and biological
characteristics of WS provide both a longer half-life in the systemic
circulation and retention within target tumors. Our finding that
systemic delivery of KLF5-siRNA using WS nanoparticles efficiently
inhibits tumor growth in vivo supports the idea that siRNAcontaining WS can be used knock down specific genes within
tumors, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect against a variety
of cancers.
