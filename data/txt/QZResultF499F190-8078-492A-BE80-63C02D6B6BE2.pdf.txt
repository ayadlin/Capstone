Abstract
Resistance to VEGF inhibitors is emerging as a major clinical problem. Notch signaling has been implicated
in tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, to investigate mechanisms of resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors, we
transduced human glioblastoma cells with retroviruses encoding Notch delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), grew them
as tumor xenografts and then treated the murine hosts with the VEGF-A inhibitor bevacizumab. We found
that DLL4-mediated tumor resistance to bevacizumab in vivo. The large vessels induced by DLL4-Notch
signaling increased tumor blood supply and were insensitive to bevacizumab. However, blockade of Notch
signaling by dibenzazepine, a g-secretase inhibitor, disrupted the large vessels and abolished the tumor
resistance. Multiple molecular mechanisms of resistance were shown, including decreased levels of hypoxiainduced VEGF and increased levels of the VEGF receptor VEGFR1 in the tumor stroma, decreased levels of
VEGFR2 in large blood vessels, and reduced levels of VEGFR3 overall. DLL4-expressing tumors were also
resistant to a VEGFR targeting multikinase inhibitor. We also observed activation of other pathways of tumor
resistance driven by DLL4-Notch signaling, including the FGF2-FGFR and EphB4-EprinB2 pathways, the
inhibition of which reversed tumor resistance partially. Taken together, our findings show the importance of
classifying mechanisms involved in angiogenesis in tumors, and how combination therapy to block DLL4Notch signaling may enhance the efficacy of VEGF inhibitors, particularly in DLL4-upregulated tumors, and
thus provide a rational base for the development of novel strategies to overcome antiangiogenic resistance in
the clinic. Cancer Res; 71(18); 6073–83. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and
metastasis and is triggered by a variety of proangiogenic
factors, regulated by many angiogenic pathways. The most
important and best characterized is the VEGF pathway (1).
Blockade of VEGF signaling inhibits tumor angiogenesis and
growth in various preclinical models (2, 3) and having systemic effects (4). The effect of anti-VEGF strategy has been

validated in randomized phase III clinical trials. Disruption of
VEGF signaling by using bevacizumab, a humanized antihuman VEGF antibody or sorafenib and sunitinib, 2 small
chemical inhibitors of receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTK) including VEGF receptors (5) have yielded a significant improvement
in progression-free survival but rarely in overall survival for
patients with several types of cancers including metastatic
colorectal cancer (6), advanced non–small cell lung cancer (7),
metastatic breast cancer (8), advanced clear-cell renal-cell
carcinoma (9–11) and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(12). However, the duration of effect is often short in clinical
trials (13). In preclinical models a number of tumors do not
respond at all, or respond initially but become resistant at a
late stage of VEGF inhibition (14, 15). In some experimental
cases, such therapy may even increase tumor invasiveness and
metastasis (16, 17). A further problem is that although this
therapy is highly specific, patients are not selected on the basis
of pathways of sensitivity or resistance in their tumors. Thus,
tumor resistance to VEGF inhibition has become a major
obstacle to the effectiveness of antiangiogenic agents in the
clinic (18, 19). Clearly, understanding the resistance mechanisms will enhance anti-VEGF efficacy by developing new
therapeutic approaches or rational drug combinations.
Notch signaling is a conserved pathway affecting many
biological processes including angiogenesis (20). Ligand

binding to the Notch receptor results in 2 successive proteolytic cleavages of the receptor. The second cleavage,
catalyzed by g-secretase, releases the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus where
it activates the transcription of downstream targets such as
EphrinB2, Hes1, and Hey1 (20). DLL4, the latest identified
Notch ligand, is predominantly expressed in arterial endothelial cells (EC) during embryonic development, and haploinsufficiency of DLL4 leads to embryonic lethality from
severe vascular defects (21). DLL4-Notch signaling inhibits
physiologic angiogenesis by reducing the number of tip cells
and thus decreasing angiogenic sprouting (22, 23). In adults,
however, we have shown that DLL4 is strongly upregulated
in tumor vasculature (24–28). Alterations of DLL4 expression inhibit multiple EC functions important in angiogenesis
(28–30). Recently, we, and other groups, showed that DLL4Notch signaling regulates tumor growth by decreasing angiogenesis but improving vascular function; conversely,
blockade of DLL4-Notch signaling strikingly increases
nonproductive angiogenesis but reduces tumor growth
(26, 31–33).
The VEGF pathway interacts with DLL4-Notch signaling in
the vasculature (20). VEGF induces the expression of DLL4
and Notch1 (28, 32, 34), while DLL4-Notch signaling reduces
signaling in the VEGF pathway by decreasing VEGFR2 expression and increasing VEGFR1 expression (28–30, 32, 34).
These characteristics have attracted many groups to further
address the roles of DLL4 in tumor response to antiangiogenic
therapy (26, 31, 32). Here, we report that DLL4-Notch signaling-mediated tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy by inducing the formation of larger vessels, which no longer depend
on VEGF signaling, and by activating multiple other signaling
pathways.

compound was in solution, the aqueous component was
added gradually to generate the dosing solution (12.5% Cremophor EL/12.5% ethanol/75% water; ref. 5). Sorafenib was
administered daily at 60 mg/kg via oral gavage. PD173074 was
given daily at 60 mg/kg in 50 mmol/L sodium lactate buffer,
pH4.0 by oral gavage. Each animal experiment was repeated at
least for 2 to 3 times.
Immunohistochemistry
The mouse CD31 and NG2 (desmin or a-SMA) stainings on
cryostat sections were done as previously described (26).
Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections at 4 mm was done
after antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0 or in citrate
buffer, pH 6.0 (for FGF2) in a Decloaker (Biocare Medical).
Primary antibodies used were against CA9 (M75, 1/75, 1 hour),
VEGF (VG1, 5 mg/mL, at 4 C for 16 hours), VEGFR3 (AF743,
1/125, 35 minutes), and FGF2 (sc79, 1/500, 1 hour). Tumor
vessels were detected on paraffin sections by rat anti-CD34
monoclonal antibody (MEC14.7, 1/250, 1 hour) using a Novolink kit (Leica Microsystems) after the antigen was retrieved in
retrieval buffer (Dako R1669). Primary antibodies were washed
off in PBS and detected using a polymer-based system (Dako).
The peroxidase reaction was developed using diaminobenzidine provided in the kit. Slides were washed and mounted in
aqueous mountant.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA extraction from xenograft tumors, quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) protocol, mHey1 and b-actin primers were
previously described (26).
Western blotting
Protein extraction and Western blotting was done using
standard techniques (28).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U87GM (U87, human glioblastoma) and HT1080 (human
fibrosarcoma) cell lines were obtained from Cancer Research
UK Cell Services. Generation of U87-EV and U87-DLL4 cells
and growth conditions were described previously (26).
Xenograft mouse models
All protocols were carried out under Home Office regulations (26). The tumor cells (107 for U87, 5  106 for HT1080)
were implanted into 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c SCID
mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.) s.c. with 100 mL of cell
suspension with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Bioscience).
Each group consisted of 5 mice. Tumor growth was monitored
and measured using calipers. Tumor volume was calculated
from a formula (V ¼ L  W  H  p/6). When used,
dibenzazepine (DBZ) and bevacizumab were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 3 days at a dose of 8.1 mmol/kg and 10
mg/kg, respectively. DBZ was resuspended in 0.5% (w/v)
Methocel E4M and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80. Anti-EphrinB2
and sEphB4 were given i.p. 3 times a week at a dose of 20
mg/kg, respectively. Sorafenib was dissolved in a 50% Cremophor EL/50% ethanol as a stock solution (4); once the

Role of DLL4 in Tumor Resistance to Anti-VEGF Therapy

mouse survival, whereas bevacizumab inhibited tumor
growth and increased animal survival of both U87-EV and
U87-DLL4 tumors when the treatment was started on the
day of tumor implantation (Fig. 1A) (26). To mimic the
clinical situation where antitumor therapies are initiated
only after patient has an established or advanced tumor, we
initiated anti-VEGF treatment when the tumor reached 150
mm3 in size. Administration of bevacizumab was still effective in inhibiting the growth and improving animal survival
of U87-EV tumors. In sharp contrast, U87-DLL4 tumors
exhibited an intrinsic resistance to bevacizumab (Fig. 1B).
Thus, DLL4 expression mediates tumor resistance to antiVEGF therapy.
We utilized DBZ, a small molecule inhibitor of g-secretase
to block Notch signaling. DBZ strongly inhibited Notch signaling in vitro, as shown by reduced protein levels of the
activated NICD and the Notch target Hes1 in ECs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Five injections of DBZ inhibited U87-DLL4
tumor growth and improved animal survival (Fig. 1C); continuous administration of DBZ completely abolished the
tumor growth stimulated by DLL4. The effect of DBZ on
Notch signaling in vivo was confirmed by assessing mHey1
expression by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we assessed the ability of DBZ to resensitize U87DLL4 tumors to VEGF inhibition, initiating the therapy when
the tumor reached 150 mm3 in size (Fig. 1D). For U87-EV
tumors, DBZ only slightly inhibited the growth whereas
bevacizumab delayed the growth; however, combining DBZ
with bevacizumab resulted in a more striking inhibition of the
growth. For U87-DLL4 tumors, DBZ significantly delayed the
growth, particularly so at later points, whereas treatment with
bevacizumab did not affect the growth at all. However, when
treatments were combined, DBZ not only abolished the tumor
resistance to bevacizumab but also synergistically enhanced
the inhibition of tumor growth and improved the animal
survival with bevacizumab.
Similar experiments with DBZ and bevacizumab were also
done in the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 tumor model where
the tumor exhibited an intrinsic resistance to VEGF inhibition.
Similar therapeutic effects were observed (Supplementary
Fig. S3), suggesting that blockade of endogenous Notch signaling by DBZ can also sensitize a tumor with intrinsic de novo
resistance to anti-VEGF therapy.
DLL4-induced large vessels but not pericyte coverage
contribute to anti-VEGF resistance
We investigated tumor neovasculature by immunostaining
for the EC marker CD31 (Fig. 2ABC). DLL4 significantly
reduced the vessel number but increased the vascular lumen
size (26). DBZ increased the number of vessels by 30% and
120% in U87-EV and U87-DLL4 tumors, respectively and
reduced the vascular lumen size in U87-DLL4 tumors.
Bevacizumab greatly decreased the vessel number by 12fold in U87-EV tumors, while only moderately by 2.5-fold in
U87-DLL4 tumors. However, bevacizumab did not affect vascular lumen size at all in U87-DLL4 tumors. In contrast, the
combination therapy not only reduced the vessel number in
both tumors but also disrupted the large vessels in U87-DLL4

tumors. Thus, the results suggest that the large vessels triggered by DLL4-Notch signaling contribute to the tumor
resistance.
We costained for CD31 and the pericyte marker NG2
(Supplementary Fig. S4). DLL4 decreased the pericyte coverage of tumor vessels (26); DBZ increased the pericyte coverage
in both U87-EV and U87-DLL4 tumors. However, bevacizumab
alone did not affect the level of pericyte coverage in either
tumor compared with their relative controls. In the tumors
cotreated with DBZ and bevacizumab, the levels of vessel
coverage by pericytes were similar to those observed in the
tumors treated with DBZ alone.
Reductions in hypoxia and VEGF contribute to antiVEGF resistance
Hypoxia increases VEGF production in tumors and we
hypothesized reduced hypoxia would decrease VEGF expression and hence reduce tumor dependency on VEGF. We
assessed hypoxia levels before and following therapeutic
treatments as indicted by response of the hypoxia inducible
factor-1 target carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9; Fig. 3AB). Expression of CA9 was lower in U87-DLL4 tumors compared with the
U87-EV control. DBZ treatment significantly increased tumor
hypoxia, as shown by strong CA9 staining in both tumor types.
Bevacizumab also induced hypoxia/CA9 expression in U87-EV
tumors because of reduced vessel numbers; however, it did not
significantly increase hypoxia in U87-DLL4 tumors.
Combined DBZ and bevacizumab treatment increased
tumor hypoxia much more efficiently than DBZ alone in
either tumor type. In addition, the combination therapy not
only increased the number of cells expressing CA9 but also the
intensity of CA9 staining (Fig. 3A). Consistent with hypoxia
(Fig. 3B), similar results were obtained for tumor necrosis
(Fig. 3C). Less hypoxia and less necrosis in DLL4 tumors could
be attributed to the persistence of functional large vessels in
bevacizumab-treated DLL4 tumors.
We costained tumor tissues with anti-CA9 and anti-VEGF
antibodies. VEGF staining was observed on vessels along
with weak cytoplasmic positivity in the tumor which seemed
to increase in intensity around necrotic areas (Fig. 3A).
Overall, the relative proportional expression of tumoral
VEGF in each group (Fig. 3D) was similar to CA9 in each
group (Fig. 3B). The level of VEGF in U87-DLL4 tumors was
much lower than in U87-EV tumors. VEGF staining on
vessels was clearly detected in U87-EV tumors as opposed
to very faint staining in U87-DLL4 tumors. DBZ increased
VEGF expression in both tumor types. In addition, DBZ
increased VEGF staining on vessels in U87-DLL4 but not
U87-EV tumors. Bevacizumab significantly increased VEGF
expression only in U87-EV but not U87-DLL4 tumors. Combined DBZ with bevacizumab substantially increased VEGF
expression in both tumors but decreased the VEGF staining
on vessels although this effect was much clearer in U87-EV
than in U87-DLL4 tumors (Fig. 3A–D). Bevacizumab treated
U87-EV tumors showed vascular disruption, a neutrophilic
vasculitis, and fibrinoid necrosis, an effect that was notably
absent in U87-DLL4 tumors. Taken together, these results
suggest that blockade of Notch signaling by DBZ induced

of U87-DLL4 tumors. Combined therapy reduced vessel numbers of both tumors and abolished the large vessels. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. NS, no

tumor hypoxia and necrosis by disrupting the large vessels,
and consequently increased the level of VEGF.
Alterations of expression of VEGFRs contribute to antiVEGF resistance
We investigated the expression of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in
stromal cells by qPCR using mouse specific primers. In vitro,
DLL4 increased VEGFR1 (and soluble VEGFR1) expression
and significantly decreased VEGFR2 expression in ECs (29, 30).
In vivo, DLL4 increased the mRNA levels of VEGFR1 but
VEGFR2 transcription was not deceased in U87-DLL4 tumors
(Fig. 4A). We then analyzed VEGFR2 transcripts in tumor
blood vessels using in situ hybridization (Fig. 4B). DLL4
reduced VEGFR2 expression only in the large vessels, whereas
DBZ restored VEGFR2 expression in tumor vessels.
However, bevacizumab did not affect the expression of
VEGFR2 in either U87-EV or U87-DLL4 tumors. In contrast,
combined treatment of DBZ with bevacizumab restored the
expression of VEGFR2 in the few remaining vessels, similar to
the effects of DBZ alone. Indeed, the protein levels of VEGFR2
expressed in the large vessels were also decreased in U87DLL4 tumors compared with U87-EV tumors (26). We further
investigated the expression of VEGFR3. DLL4 reduced the

www.aacrjournals.org

mRNA level of VEGFR3 in human microvascular EC (hMEC-1)
in vitro and the protein level in tumor neovasculature in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these results suggest
that the large vessels were insensitive to VEGF due to the low
expression of VEGFR2, and increased expression of VEGFR1
further diminished the sensitivity of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling
in tumors.
To inhibit mouse and human VEGF effects and exclude the
possibility that antibody transport was a mechanism of resistance, we treated both tumor types with sorafenib to inhibit
VEGFR1-R3. Sorafenib delayed the growth and improved
animal survival of U87-EV tumors (Fig. 4C) but the efficiency
was less than bevacizumab treatment (see Figure 1). Sorafenib
marginally inhibited U87-DLL4 tumor growth and significantly improved animal survival of U87-DLL4 tumors, although
this effect was greater than bevacizumab treatment alone (see
Figure 1), presumably due to the blockade other RTKs (5).
Activation of FGF2-FGFR signaling contributes to antiVEGF resistance
DLL4-Notch signaling significantly increased the expression
of FGF2 in ECs in vitro (29) and in U87-DLL4 tumors in vivo at
the protein level (Fig. 5A). We then treated both U87-EV and

FGF2-FGFR signaling in ECs in vitro, reflected by elimination
of tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK induced by FGF2 (Fig. 5B).
In U87-EV tumors, PD173074 did not significantly inhibit the
growth but slightly enhanced the efficacy of bevacizumab
(Fig. 5C). In contrast, PD173074 slightly inhibited U87-DLL4
growth but significantly improved the tumor response to
bevacizumab in the combination treatment (Fig. 5D).
Activation of EphB4-EphrinB2 signaling contributes to
anti-VEGF resistance
The expression of EphB4 and EphrinB2 in tumors was
assessed by qPCR. EphB4, but not EphrinB2, was significantly
upregulated in U87-DLL4 tumors compared with the control
(Fig. 6A), suggesting that EphB4-EphrinB2 signaling is enhanced as a result of increased EphB4 in the tumor. We
therefore treated both tumor types with anti-EphrinB2 antibody or soluble EphB4 protein (sEphB4) that inhibit internalization and phosphorylation of EphrinB2, respectively. Single
therapy with anti-EphrinB2 or sEphB4 did not significantly
affect the growth of either tumor type (Fig. 6B), but combined
anti-EphrinB2 or sEphB4 with bevacizumab significantly
inhibited the growth and improved survival of U87-DLL4

6078

tumors (Fig. 6C). Neither anti-EphrinB2 nor sEphB4 enhanced
the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination treatments in
U87-EV tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the results
suggest that increased EphrinB2 reverse signaling in DLL4tumors contributes to the tumor resistance to anti-VEGF
therapy.
We investigated tumor neovasculature further by immunostaining for CD31 (Fig. 6D). Anti-EphrinB2 or sEphB4
significantly reduced the vessel number but not the vessel
size in U87-EV tumors. However, both anti-EphrinB2 and
sEphB4 increased the vessel number and reduced the vessel
size in U87-DLL4 tumors. Combined anti-EphrinB2 or sEphB4
with bevacizumab not only decreased the vessel number but
also abolished most, if not all, of the large vessels in DLL4
tumors. Taken together, the results suggest that blockade of
EphrinB2 reverse signaling partially resensitized the tumor
response to anti-VEGF therapy by disrupting the majority of
large vessels induced by DLL4-Notch signaling.

Discussion
Multiple mechanisms are involved in tumor resistance to
anti-VEGF therapy. These include preexistence/activation
of alternative angiogenic pathways, recruiting vascular

progenitor cells from the bone marrow, increasing pericyte
coverage, and enhanced capability of tumor cells to invade (13,
15). Here, we show that DLL4-Notch signaling mediates tumor
resistance to bevacizumab in vivo. DLL4 is predominantly
upregulated in tumor vasculature in preclinical models (21, 26,
31, 33) and in clinical tumor samples (24–28). However, DLL4
is also substantially upregulated in a subset of tumor cells in
several human cancers including glioblastoma, colon, and
breast cancer (24–28). Thus, our model by upregulating
DLL4 in glioblastoma cells growing in immunodeficient mice
is clinically relevant. Our findings may explain why so many
patients in clinical trials do not respond to bevacizumab (13).

www.aacrjournals.org

Importantly, disruption of DLL4-Notch signaling by DBZ not
only abolished the tumor resistance but also synergistically
enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of bevacizumab.
All current clinical trials investigate the therapeutic efficiency of VEGF inhibitors without examining the expression
of markers such as DLL4 and their subsequent impact in
tumor and patient response to therapy. We investigated
DLL4 expression in advanced breast tumors from AVF2119g,
a randomized phase III trial by adding bevacizumab to
capecitabine chemotherapy. When the tumors did not express DLL4 or had very low level expression, patients had a
significant prolongation of progression free-survival upon

adding bevacizumab; however, when DLL4 was highly
expressed there was no benefit to the patients on adding
bevacizumab (36). Thus our findings are clinically corroborated by the investigation of this randomized trial.
Our results indicated that the large vessels triggered by
DLL4-Notch signaling play a central role in tumor resistance
to bevacizumab. Bevacizumab only decreased the numbers of
small vessels but did not affect the large vessels. These large
vessels effectively delivered oxygen and nutrients to tumor
cells as revealed by an increase in blood perfusion (26),
resulting in a reduction in hypoxia and necrosis in DLL4
tumors. Reduced hypoxia decreased VEGF production and
thus decreased the tumor dependency on VEGF. DLL4 decreased VEGFR2 expression in the large vessels and increased
VEGFR1 expression in the tumor microenvironment, further
diminishing the sensitivity of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling. Blockade of DLL4-Notch signaling by DBZ abolished the large
vessels, leading to a substantial increase of hypoxia and VEGF

expression in DLL4 tumors, and consequently enhanced the
therapeutic efficacy of bevacizumab. We found increased
VEGF expression and although this may appear surprising
in the context of bevacizumab treatment, we would still expect
to detect intracellular VEGF in cells synthesizing or internalizing it. The observation of a neutrophilic vasculitis in the EVtumors treated with bevacizumab, was most likely a response
to the necrosis induced in the control tumors in contrast to
the DLL4 tumors.
Increased and tight pericyte coverage of newly formed
vessels has been shown to contribute to tumor resistance
to anti-VEGF therapy (13, 37). However, we found that this is
not the case in our models since DLL4 reduced the pericyte
coverage and the reduction of pericyte coverage did not
increase the sensitivity of bevacizumab. The SDF-1a/CXCR4
axis was reported to be essential for the pericyte recruitment
in the PDGF-BB–expressing tumors (38). We previously
reported that DLL4 inhibits CXCR4 expression in vitro and

Role of DLL4 in Tumor Resistance to Anti-VEGF Therapy

Figure 6. EphrinB2 reverse
signaling contributed to the tumor
resistance to anti-VEGF therapy.
A, neither human nor mouse
EphrinB2 was upregulated in U87DLL4 tumors as revealed by
qPCR. Both human and mouse
EphB4 were increased in U87DLL4 tumors as shown by qPCR.
B, neither anti-EpherinB2
monoclonal antibody (B2) nor
sEphB4 affected tumor growth
(left) and animal survival (right) of
both U87-EV and U87-DLL4
tumors. C, either anti-EphrinB2
antibody or sEphB4 sensitized the
tumor response to bevacizumab
(left) and improved animal survival
(right) of U87-DLL4 tumors. D,
anti-CD31 immunochemical
staining showed that either antiEphrinB2 antibody or sEphB4
decreased vessel numbers in
U87-EV tumors but increased
vessel numbers in U87-DLL4
tumors. Anti-EphrinB2 antibody or
sEphB4 disrupted most of the
large vessels. Combined antiEphrinB2 or sEphB4 with
bevacizumab not only decreased
vessel numbers but also abolished
the large vessels in U87-DLL4
tumors. Treatment schedules are
indicated by red arrowheads
(anti-EphrinB2 or sEphB4)
and purple arrowheads
(bevacizumab). Mean  SE, n ¼ 5.

in vivo (39), thus providing a mechanism for the decreased
pericyte coverage in DLL4-tumors.
VEGFR3 is also important in tumor angiogenesis (40, 41)
and is regulated by Notch signaling (23, 41, 42). In U87-DLL4
tumors, the protein level of VEGFR3 was significantly downregulated, which may also produce resistance to VEGFR3
inhibitors. Sorafenib had a marginal effect on the growth of

DLL4 tumors, suggesting that DLL4 may also contribute to
tumor resistance to other antiangiogenic agents for example,
blockers of VEGFR3 or VEGFC. FGF2 has been shown to
confer tumor resistance to anti-VEGF signaling in the RIPTg2 pancreatic islet tumor model, some syngeneic mouse
models, and in vitro cultures (14, 43, 44). We found that
FGF2 was significantly increased and bevacizumab further

increased FGF2 expression in DLL4 tumors. However, the
FGF2-FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, marginally inhibited the
growth of DLL4 tumors but significantly improved the tumor
response to bevacizumab, suggesting that FGF2-FGFR minimally contributes to the tumor resistance.
Recent studies showed that interaction of EphB4 with
EphrinB2 inhibited EC sprouting and promoted circumferential growth of vessels, and reverse signaling via EphrinB2
decreased vessel numbers, but increased vessel lumen diameter, resulting in tumor progression (45, 46). EphrinB2 is a wellknown downstream target of DLL4-Notch signaling (29, 30) and
VEGF can effectively induce EphrinB2 but repress EphB4 (47).
However, VEGF levels are reduced in DLL4 tumors due to
reduced hypoxia, which may reverse this phenotype. Indeed, we
found that EphB4, but not EphrinB2, was significantly higher in
DLL4 tumors. sEphB4 was shown to antagonize forward and
reverse signaling of EphrinB2, reduce vessel density and inhibit
xenograft tumor growth (48). Anti-EphB4 antibody inhibited
tumor angiogenesis and growth alone and in combination with
bevacizumab (49). Combined therapy of sEphB4 with soluble
DLL4 displayed cumulative efficacy against mouse insulinoma
growth (50). We found that both sEphB4 and anti-EphrinB2
reduced the vessel number in U87-EV tumors, but increased the
vessel number and reduced the vessel size in U87-DLL4 tumors.
However, neither sEphB4 nor anti-EphrinB2 alone inhibited the
growth of either tumor type. Importantly, both sEphB4 and
anti-EphrinB2 resensitized the tumor response to bevacizumab
by disrupting the large vessels, further highlighting the role of
the large vessels in tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. This
also shows the heterogeneity of response to such therapies in
different tumor models.
In conclusion, we found that DLL4-induced Notch signaling mediates tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy by
inducing the formation of large vessels and activating

multiple pathways in tumors. Importantly, blocking these
bypass pathways had little effect on the more sensitive
parent tumors, but showed greater effects in combination
with bevacizumab in DLL4-tumors. The clinical implications
for clinical trial design are that patients need to be carefully
categorized by analysis of pathways in tumors, and combination strategies designed. Our findings provide a rational
base for the development of novel strategies to overcome
antiangiogenic resistance, and suggest that combination
therapy by blocking both DLL4 and VEGF pathways may
enhance the antitumor efficacy in the clinic, and DLL4 levels
in tumor and vascular tissue should be assessed as a
predictive biomarker.
