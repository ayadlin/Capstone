Abstract
Thyroid hormone is a pleiotropic factor that controls many
cellular processes in multiple cell types such as cancer stem cells
(CSC). Thyroid hormone concentrations in the blood are stable,
but the action of the deiodinases (D2–D3) provides cell-speciﬁc
regulation of thyroid hormone activity. Deregulation of deiodinase function and thyroid hormone status has been implicated in
tumorigenesis. Therefore, we investigated the role of thyroid
hormone metabolism and signaling in colorectal CSCs (CR-CSC),
where deiodinases control cell division and chemosensitivity. We
found that increased intracellular thyroid hormone concentration
through D3 depletion induced cell differentiation and sharply

mitigated tumor formation. Upregulated BMP4 expression and
concomitantly attenuated Wnt signaling accompanied these
effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BMP4 is a direct thyroid
hormone target and is involved in a positive autoregulatory
feedback loop that modulates thyroid hormone signaling. Collectively, our ﬁndings highlight a cell-autonomous metabolic
mechanism by which CR-CSCs exploit thyroid hormone signaling to facilitate their self-renewal potential and suggest that druginduced cell differentiation may represent a promising therapy
for preventing CSC expansion and tumor progression. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Many in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the thyroid
status affects tumorigenesis. Type 3 deiodinase (D3) is an oncofetal protein frequently expressed in proliferating and neoplastic
cells, where it controls aspects of diseases, injury responsiveness,
and tumorigenesis (5). Congruently, the actions of the deiodinases provide tissue-speciﬁc regulation of thyroid hormone
action at an intracellular level (2). In different tumoral contexts,
deiodinases are under the control of relevant pathways in cancer,
such as Wnt and Shh (5).
Many in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that thyroid
status affects tumor formation, growth, and metastasis in experimental laboratory animals and humans (5). However, the relationship between the cell-speciﬁc mechanisms, which control
thyroid hormone ligand availability and properties of cancer
cells, is still unknown.
Colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSC) represent a small subset
of cells within the tumor mass with self-renewing potential and
the ability to engraft and generate tumors in immunodeﬁcient
mice (6, 7). According to the CSC model, these cells are difﬁcult to
kill and their relative insensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs may
explain the frequent failure of conventional treatments used
against advanced tumors (8).
The intestine is a highly dynamic tissue, characterized by rapid
and continuous regeneration and supported by crypt intestinal
stem cells (9). The Wnt signal, which rigorously controls the
sequential events that leads to the transition from normal colon
mucosa to adenocarcinoma, is one of the major forces that
maintain the stem cells' fate and capacity to self-renew as
well as their ability to escape conventional chemotherapyinduced apoptosis (10, 11). We recently demonstrated that the

T3 is a pleiotropic hormone, which controls several cellular
processes, including growth, development, and homeostasis (1).
The main thyroid product thyroxine (T4) is inactive until converted into the active hormone T3 via type 1 or type 2 deiodinase
(D1 and D2), while type 3 deiodinase (D3) converts T4 and T3
into inactive metabolites (2, 3).
T3 primarily acts as a transcription factor upon binding to its
nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. Thyroid hormone receptors
heterodimerize with many other nuclear receptors and bind the
chromatin to thyroid hormone receptor response elements (TRE)
for the positive or negative regulation of target genes transcription
(4).

Wnt–b-catenin pathway drives an inverse, coordinated regulation
of D2 and D3 in colon cancer cells (12).
Here, we demonstrate that CR-CSCs are highly sensitive to
intracellular T3. After T3 treatment or D3 depletion, CR-CSCs
undergo differentiation, a process that under normal serum conditions requires intracellular T4 to T3 conversion. This is achieved
through increases in the BMP-4 levels and its downstream targets
and signiﬁcant attenuation of the Wnt pathway. Strikingly,
increasing intracellular T3 results in reduced clonogenic and
tumorigenic potential and establishes a higher sensitivity of
CR-CSCs to conventional chemotherapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Sphere puriﬁcation and propagation from patients with colorectal cancer were assessed as described previously (8, 13, 14).
Cells were monthly tested for mycoplasma contamination as
described previously (14). To evaluate the asymmetric division,
single CR-CSCs were also labeled with PKH26 dye (2  106 mol/
L, Sigma), cultured for up to 14 days, and subjected to ﬂow
cytometry analysis to yield the PKH positivity. BMP4, at a concentration of 100 ng/mL, in combination with rT3, was added to
CR-CSCs and cultured up to 48 hours. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (CaCo-2, obtained in 2005 from ATCC and
authenticated by RT-PCR analyses), cultured in adherent conditions in presence of DMEM medium and supplemented with 2
mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% FBS (ATCC).
Reagents and plasmids
The BMP4 reporter plasmid was generated by PCR on genomic
DNA with two sets of oligonucleotides (5mBMP4pU and
5mBMP4pL, and 3mBMP4pU and 3mBMP4pL). Two regions
were ampliﬁed: 859 bp (containing the ﬁrst exon) and 552 bp
(containing the 30 UTR of the mouse bmp4 gene). The PCR
products were digested with SacI/XhoI and cloned in pGL3basic
(50 -UTR BMP4) or TKpGL3 (30 -UTR BMP4).
Lentiviral and luciferase reporter assays
Cells were transiently transfected (FuGENE 6; Roche) with a
mixture of inducible TCF/LEF–responsive ﬁreﬂy luciferase and
constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase (40:1), or with a negative control containing a mixture of noninducible ﬁreﬂy luciferase and constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase (40:1). The
relative quantiﬁcation of gene expression was calculated on
triplicate reactions using the comparative Ct method (DDCt).
Invasion assay
Cell migration was measured using growth factor–depleted
Matrigel-coated (BD Biosciences) transwell inserts. Dissociated
CR-CSCs (5  103), transduced with a D3-speciﬁc miRNA (iD3)
or control scramble miRNA (iCTR), were placed on 8-mm pore size
Matrigel-coated transwell (Corning). NIH-3T3-stem cell–conditioned medium was used as a chemoattractant and plated in the
bottom compartment of transwell. After plating, migrated cells
were counted up to 72 hours. Cell viability was evaluated on
spheres transfected with a D3-speciﬁc RNAi pool.
Real-time PCR
The mRNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Ltd). The cDNAs were prepared with Superscript III (Life

1238 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

Technologies, Ltd) as indicated by the manufacturer. The cDNAs
were ampliﬁed by PCR in an iQ5 Multicolor Real Time Detector
System (Bio-Rad) with the ﬂuorescent double-stranded DNAbinding dye SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). The relative amounts of gene
expression were calculated with cyclophillin A expression as an
internal standard (calibrator). The results, expressed as N-fold
differences in target gene expression, were determined as follows:
N  target ¼ 2(Ct sample Ct calibrator).
Western blot analysis
Cells were resuspended in ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer, fractioned on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were exposed to speciﬁc antibodies for Notch full length (sc-6014-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cleaved Notch-ICD (Cell Signaling Technology,
2421), E-cadherin (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), pAkt (9271, Ser 473, rabbit IgG; Cell Signaling Technology), Akt (9272, rabbit IgG; Cell Signaling Technology), pGSK3
(Ser 9, rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), GSK3
(rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), PTEN (138G6,
rabbit IgG; Cell Signaling Technology), or tubulin (T9026,
Sigma), and detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). p21 (sc-397)
and p27 (sc-1641) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Densitometry analyses were performed by Scion Image. Results were expressed as protein/tubulin optical
density ratio.
Immunoﬂuorescence/IHC
For the immunoﬂuorescence, CR-CSC cytospins, untreated
and treated with T3 and rT3, were ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and washed
in PBS. Thereafter, the slides were exposed to antibodies
against cytokeratin 20 (Ks20.8, mouse IgG2a; Dako Cytomation) and BMP4 (3H2, mouse IgG1; Novocastra), both diluted
in PBS þ 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Cells were
treated with ﬂuorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies
(Invitrogen) plus RNaseA (200 ng/mL, Sigma) and counterstained with Toto-3 iodide (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed on a Nikon C1-Si confocal microscope equipped with
EZ-C1 software.
Parafﬁn-embedded sections of xenografts were subjected to
speciﬁc antibodies for CK20 (Ks20.8, mouse IgG2a; Dako Cytomation), Ki67 (MIB-1, mouse IgG1; Dako Cytomation), CD133
(AC133, mouse IgG2b; Miltenyi Biotec), or isotype-matched
controls at appropriate dilutions. Apoptotic events were determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay using the In Situ
Cell Death Detection, AP Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA
strand breaks were detected by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP, Dako Cytomation) substrate.
Cell viability was assessed by using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega) on sphere cells, treated with T3
or rT3, for up to 6 days, and then exposed to oxaliplatin (100
nmol/L) and 5-ﬂuorouracil (50 mg/mL), alone or in combination.
Cell death was evaluated by orange acridine (50 mg/mL)/ethidium
bromide (1 mg/mL) staining.
To evaluate the proportion of differentiated and undifferentiated cells, CR-CSCs were cultured in stem cell medium in
adherent conditions with 100 ng/mL BMP4 for up to 72 hours.

Thyroid Hormone in Colon Cancer Stem Cells

CR-CSC transduction
CR-CSCs were transduced with lentiviral-TOP-dGFP-reporter
as reported previously (14). TOP-dGFP high and low (Wnthigh
and WntLow) populations were enriched by FACSaria (BD
Biosciences). The relative quantiﬁcation of gene expression was
calculated in triplicate reactions using the comparative Ct method
(DDCt). BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi Expression System (Life Technologies, Ltd) was used to the expression of miRNA silencing D3
(iD3) or negative control miR (iCTRL) into dissociated sphere
cells, as previously reported (12).
Clonogenic assay
Dissociated sphere cells were cultured in presence or absence of
FBS and exposed to 30 nmol/L rT3 or T3, on ultra-low adhesion
96-well plates at a single cell concentration. rT3 and T3 were
added every 48 hours at the end of experiments. Wells containing
either none or more than one cell were excluded for analysis.
Sphere formation in culture was monitored and counted under
light microscope for up to 21 days. The CSC frequency was
calculated using the ELDA algorithm (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.
au/software/elda/).
RT2 Proﬁler PCR array
The RT2 Proﬁler PCR array was performed to simultaneously
evaluate the mRNA levels of 89 genes responsive to and related to
WNT signal transduction, following the manufacturer's protocol
(PAHS-243Z, PAHS-043Z; SuperArray Bioscience). Cycle threshold values were normalized using the average of 5 housekeeping
genes in 96-well plates (B2M, HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPDH, and
ACTB). The comparative cycle threshold method was used to
calculate the relative quantiﬁcation of gene expression (cells
treated with T3 and rT3 in presence of 10% FBS medium versus
untreated or cultured with 10% FBS). RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array Data
Analysis was represented by clustergrams based on Pearson correlation of 2DCt.
Flow cytometry
Cell-cycle analysis was evaluated on dissociated CR-CSCs as
previously described (13).
Tumor xenografts
Dissociated CR-CSCs (5  105) and those transfected with a
D3-speciﬁc RNAi pool were injected subcutaneously with Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced (BD Biosciences) at a 1:2 ratio in a
total volume of 100 mL. Tumor size was calculated once a week up
to 10 weeks according to the following formula: (p/6)  larger
diameter  (smaller diameter)2.
Human and animal studies and approval
Colorectal cancer specimens were obtained from 14 patients
(age range 50–57 years) undergoing cancer resection (Table 1), in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Committee on human experimentation (Convention on Human
Rights and Biomedicine, Oviedo, 4.IV.1997). None of the patients
was under thyroid hormone treatment before surgery. Informed
consent for all patients was obtained prior to their participation in
this study. All research was conducted within the Ethical principles
for Medical Research involving human subjects expressed by the
Declaration of Helsinki (revised version, Seul 2008, nn.14–15).
Male NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD/SCID) mice, 7 weeks old,
were acquired from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were

University of Palermo Animal Care committee, in an animal
house authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (DGSAF
#0020301-P-03.10.2014).
Statistical analysis
Differences between samples were assessed by a Student twotailed t test for independent samples. P values less than 0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant. Relative mRNA levels (in which the ﬁrst
sample was arbitrarily set as 1) are reported as results of real-time
PCR, in which expression of cyclophilin A was used as a housekeeping gene. All experiments were repeated and analyzed three to
ﬁve times. Extreme limiting dilution assay analysis was performed
to determine the statistical differences in stem cell–like frequency
among the treatment groups.

Results
Intracellular thyroid hormone concentration is adapted by
CR-CSCs to control multiple cell properties.
To assess the sensitivity of CSCs to T3 signaling, we initially
demonstrated the expression of thyroid hormone receptors
TRa and TRb and transporters in freshly puriﬁed CD133þ cells
from two different colorectal cancer samples (Supplementary
Figs. S1–S3). Thereafter, we analyzed deiodinases expression in
CR-CSCs during FBS-induced differentiation. Both D2 and D3
were expressed and oppositely regulated during spontaneous
differentiation (Fig. 1A). D3 mRNA was at its highest level in
proliferating CR-CSCs and diminished during differentiation.
Contrarily, D2 expression, barely detectable in proliferating colorectal cancers, drastically increased in differentiated cells. We have
previously demonstrated that subpopulations of CR-CSCs with
high expression of Wnt (WntHigh) differ from those with a low
expression of Wnt (WntLow), with respect to their stemness and
ability to differentiate (15). In FACS sorted cells, we observed that
WntHigh cells are characterized by a strong expression of type 3
deiodinase, and a corresponding reduction in putative thyroid
hormone–target genes (Supplementary Fig. S2), thus conﬁrming
that D3 expression marks the highly proliferating subset of CRCSCs and is regulated by the Wnt pathway (Fig. 1B). To assess the
effect of exogenous T3-treatment, we cultured CR-CSCs under
different T3 conditions and evaluated their morphology after 3
and 6 days. T3 treatment alone is sufﬁcient to induce morphologic
cell changes similar to what was observed when using FBS

treatment, that is, large, ﬂatted, polygonal-shape cells. In contrast,
rT3 treatment (by abolishing D2-mediated T4 to T3 conversion
and the consequent reduction in intracellular T3) impairs FBSinduced differentiation by markedly reducing the expression of
CK20 (Fig. 1C). Overall, these data indicated that while exogenous T3 treatment is sufﬁcient to promote cell differentiation,
FBS-induced differentiation occurs via endogenous T3, which
derives from T4-to-T3 conversion.
T3 signal is essential for the BMP4-induced CSC differentiation
It has been proven that BMP4 is a major promoter of differentiation in normal colonic stem cells (13). To get insights into
the mechanisms by which T3 induces cellular differentiation, we
investigated the existence of a putative interplay between T3 and
BMP4 signals. Notably, we observed that T3 treatment sustains
BMP4 synthesis while rT3 inhibits FBS-mediated BMP4 induction
(Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that BMP4 could be a novel T3-target
gene as suggested by a ChIP-seq and in silico analyses (unpublished data and Fig. 2B, top). To prove this, we cloned a 859-bp
(part of 50 -UTR) and a 552-bp DNA region (part of 30 -UTR)
containing two putative thyroid hormone receptor–binding sites
upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (50 -UTR BMP4 and 30 UTR BMP4, Fig. 2B, top). Functional assays demonstrated that T3
strongly induces the activation of both the 50 and 30 regions of the
BMP4 gene (Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay conﬁrmed that the 50 -UTR and
30 -UTR region of the BMP4 gene are physically associated with

1240 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

TRa in colorectal cancer cells and this interaction is potentiated by
T3 (Fig. 2B, bottom). Altogether, these results indicate that BMP4
is a novel T3-responsive gene in colorectal cancer cells.
Considering that BMP4 induces a noncanonical pathway that
involves PI3K/AKT activation and modulates the Wnt signaling,
we tested the effects of T3 depletion on PI3K/AKT. Western blot
analysis revealed that T3 attenuation by rT3 potently induces
phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3b in FBS- and BMP4-treated
cells. Accordingly, E-cadherin was induced by T3 and downmodulated by T3 signal reduction (Fig. 2C).
Interestingly, BMP4 was able to induce the expression of the T3producing enzyme D2, and reduce the T3-inactivating enzyme,
D3 (Fig. 2D). Such a double regulation generates an auto-sustaining loop driven by BMP4, which is a T3 target and simultaneously aims to increase intracellular T3 by modulating deiodinases (Fig. 2E). Overall, these data indicate that T3 induces
differentiation of colorectal cancer cells by reducing BMP/PI3K/
AKT signaling, a process that is auto-sustained by BMP.
T3 treatment alters the clonogenic capacity and cell-cycle
kinetics of colorectal cancer cells by affecting active Notch
We evaluated the clonogenic potential of colorectal cancer
spheres, which were characterized for the expression of the putative
and functional stem cell markers CD133 and CD44v6 (Supplementary Fig. S3) cultured at different T3 concentrations. As shown
in Fig. 3A, the clonogenic capacity of colorectal cancer cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of serum (by 54%) or T3 (by

58%), compared with those cultured in stem medium. In contrast,
rT3 treatment signiﬁcantly preserved the clonogenic capacity, even
in the presence of serum. CSC frequency conﬁrmed the ability of T3
to induce differentiation (1/13.43 vs. 1/6.75) and thereby decrease
the clonogenic activity of CR-CSCs (Fig. 3A, bottom).
Of note, we observed that the exogenous exposure to FBS or T3
signiﬁcantly decreased the quiescent cell compartment in the
G0–G1 phase of CR-CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S5). This is in
accordance with the notion that T3 awakens CR-CSCs from their
dormant state by enhancing the p21 and p27 expression levels
(Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
Subsequently, we monitored cell division by analyzing the
distribution of the membrane dye PKH26 expression via
FACS (16). While 81% of cells in stem medium underwent
asymmetric division, the vast majority of them, grown in stem
medium plus T3 as well as in FBS, arrested cell division (Fig. 3B),
the latter completely reversed via rT3 treatment. Altogether, these
results suggest that T3 alters the percentage of asymmetric cell
division in CSCs, thus affecting their ability to maintain the stemlike properties.

www.aacrjournals.org

As Notch is a critical regulator of asymmetric cell division
and cell fate in colorectal cancer cells (17, 18), we sought to
assess whether T3 might induce variations in Notch activity.
Hence, we measured the expression levels of the active Notch
(Notch-ICD). As shown in Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S7,
T3 or D3 depletion greatly induced the intracellular cleavage
and activation of Notch. FBS-induced Notch activation was
completely revoked by rT3, thus indicating a key role of
intracellular T3 in the regulation of Notch pathway.
T3 downmodulates the Wnt pathway, inhibits the tumorigenic
potential, and sensitizes CR-CSCs to chemotherapy-induced
death.
Given the relevance of the Wnt pathway with regard to the
functional state of CR-CSCs (15, 19) and its cross talk with the
BMP-4 pathway, we aimed to investigate the possible inﬂuence of
T3 on the Wnt pathway. For this purpose, we compared the
transcriptional proﬁle of Wnt targets and Wnt pathway–relevant
genes in T3-treated sphere cells. Clustergrams showed Wnt activation in CSCs when untreated and treated with FBS plus rT3.

Vice versa, T3 treatment resulted in a considerable reduction of
relevant Wnt targets, including b-catenin, associated with the
upregulation of negative regulators of the Wnt receptor signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S8). This analysis signiﬁcantly points to T3 as
a potent repressor of Wnt signaling.

Untreated CR-CSCs generated palpable tumors within 3–4 weeks,
which were strikingly reduced in T3-treated cells (Fig. 3D).
Tumors derived from T3-treated cells show elevated CK20 expression levels and abundant cell death. Furthermore, the CD133 and
Ki67 expression was drastically reduced in CR-CSCs exposed to T3

Thyroid Hormone in Colon Cancer Stem Cells

(Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating a substantial effect on proliferating cells endowed with self-renewal capacity.
D3 is the T3-inactivating enzyme often overexpressed in human
cancer (5). To assess the role of D3 in the modulation of intracellular T3 and its effect on tumorigenic potential, we infected CRCSCs with a lentivirus able to efﬁciently knockdown D3 (12). D3
knockdown in CR-CSCs cells dramatically reduced the in vitro
clonogenicity and their invasive capability as well as tumor
growth in immunocompromised mice (data not shown). D3depleted CR-CSCs failed to give rise to detectable tumor outgrowth. In line with the observed T3 effects, D3 depletion potently
reduced the xenograft's growth, which is consistent with an
increase of the intracellular T3 availability in the absence of D3
(Fig. 3E). These data underline that T3 signaling is a strong
determinant in the CSCs' ability to promote tumorigenesis
in vivo.
We have previously reported that CSCs are widely resistant to
chemotherapeutic drugs (8). To assess whether such a complex
regulation of T3 on the BMP4/Wnt pathways in CR-CSCs might
inﬂuence their ability to respond to chemotherapy, we investigated whether T3 is able to alter the resistance to oxaliplatin
(OX), 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), and their combination (FOX), at
clinically relevant doses. Time course treatment showed that,
while untreated spheres were largely inert to chemotherapeutic
drug-induced apoptosis, T3 treatment caused an increased
percentage of cell death (up to 75%), when combined with
FOX. RT3 treatment did not alter the cell resistance to drugs
(Fig. 3F).

Discussion
Despite improvements in therapeutic strategies, colorectal
cancers remain the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in western countries, due to the failure in curing the metastatic
disease. Although canonical cancer treatments have been
designed to reduce the rapidly growing tumor cells, CSCs are
spared and are still able to mediate cancer relapse after chemotherapy and radiation (20). This suggests that curative therapies
can be effective only by targeting the subpopulations of those
tumor cells with self-renewing potential.
Drug-induced differentiation represents a promising approach
to hamper CSCs' self-renewal ability. Although differentiation
therapies do not selectively kill CSCs, they make them more
sensitive to the conventional therapies and ultimately eradicate
the tumor-driving cell population. Contrary to the haematologic
malignancies, the clinical use of differentiation-inducing agents to
treat solid tumors is very limited (21, 22).
We demonstrate that CR-CSCs with b-catenin activation display high levels of D3, which correlate to an enhanced selfrenewal capacity. Drug-induced differentiation could represent
a promising approach to hamper the self-renewal ability of CSCs.
Our data provide evidence that, while D3 contributes to maintain
the undifferentiated status, T3 induces differentiation, affects the
Wnt target–related genes, and sensitizes CR-CSCs to the standard
chemotherapeutic drugs by downmodulating the AKT/PI3K pathway. Furthermore, D3-induced inactivation of thyroid hormone
stabilizes the quiescence status of CR-CSCs, altered by T3 exposure. Targeting D3 abrogated the tumorigenic activity in vivo of
CR-CSCs.
It was reported that the Notch1 hinders the b-catenin activation
by reducing the levels of the available unphosphorylated (active)

www.aacrjournals.org

form (23). Triggering the Notch signal pathway induces the
cytoplasmic cleavage of Notch-ICD, which activates nuclear
Notch target genes that mainly promote differentiation (24). It
was also demonstrated that the overexpression of Notch has a
negative effect on colorectal cancer progression, thus suggesting
Notch as a favorable prognostic marker (25). In line with these
data, we show that T3 controls the self-renewal pathway of CRCSCs through the activation of canonical Notch pathway. While
T3 induces the cleavage of Notch-ICD, D3 restores the levels of
activated b-catenin drastically decreasing the expression levels of
Notch that are sustained by T3.
In CR-CSCs, Notch signaling increases asymmetric division,
which generates one daughter cell that retains stem cell properties (17, 18). Meanwhile, the second daughter cell undergoes
a differentiation process via multiple division rounds. In this
scenario, the stem cell pool can be expanded by a series of
symmetric cell divisions that is essentially controlled by the
Notch inhibitors. Importantly, D3 action, by reducing intracellular T3, increases the frequency of symmetric self-renewing
divisions of CR-CSCs, which could explain the enhanced tumor
growth.
We have previously demonstrated that BMP4 displays high
antitumor activity in colorectal cancer by inducing CSC differentiation, targeting survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance
(13). Interestingly T3, a potent BMP4 inducer, impairs clonogenic
activity and xenograft tumor outgrowth, suggesting this molecule
as a key effector in the activation of the colorectal cancer differentiation program. Being that T3 reduces nuclear b-catenin accumulation, the PI3K/AKT pathway may represent a connection
point between BMP4 and Wnt pathways, implying an active
crosstalk that balances stemness and differentiation in CR-CSCs.
The ability of this hormone to regulate the BMP4 gene activation is
conﬁrmed by the ChIP-seq and in silico analysis that provide a
feedback control of the differentiation pathway. Likewise, a D3induced increase of BMP4 inhibitors restores their self-renewal
capacity, tumorigenic capacity, and refractoriness to conventional
anticancer therapies.
In summary, our ﬁndings suggest that intracellular T3 exerts a
prodifferentiative effect that prevents CSC expansion and triggers
a differentiation program. The latter may result in CSCs depletion,
thereby hampering tumor development. While D3 enhances
tumor growth, T3 signaling appears particularly effective in
inducing differentiation, growth reduction, and chemosensitization of CR-CSCs. The therapeutic effects observed by the combined action on intracellular T3 and chemotherapy further substantiate the necessity to target the stem-like population of cancer
cells to improve colorectal cancer treatment and open new avenues for the use of locally manipulated deiodinases for treating
proliferative disorders or hormone-sensitive tumors such as colorectal cancers.
