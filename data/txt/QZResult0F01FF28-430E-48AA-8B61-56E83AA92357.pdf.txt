ABSTRACT
The current research studied the potential effect of autophagy on icaritin-induced
anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) cell activity. Treatment of icaritin in both primary and
established (HT-29) CRC cells induced feedback activation of autophagy, evidenced
by p62 degradation, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related gene-5 (ATG-5) upregulation,
as well as light chain 3B (LC3B)-GFP puncta formation. Pharmacological inhibiting
of autophagy dramatically potentiated icaritin-induced CRC cell death and apoptosis.
Meanwhile, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 or ATG-5 also sensitized icaritininduced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Icaritin activated AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) signaling in CRC cells, functioning as the upstream signaling for autophagy
activation. shRNA/siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα1inhibited icaritin-induced
autophagy activation, but exacerbated CRC cell death. On the other hand, the AMPK
activator compound 13 (C13) or the autophagy activator MHY1485 attenuated icaritininduced cytotoxicity. In nude mice, icaritin (oral administration)-induced HT-29 tumor
growth inhibition was potentiated when combined with AMPKα1 shRNA knockdown
in tumors. We conclude that feedback activation of AMPK-autophagy pathway could
be a primary resistance factor of icaritin.

INTRODUCTION

found that icaritin activated JNK-dependent mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (mPTP) necrosis pathway to
kill CRC cells [10].
One important aim of the current study is to identify
possible icaritin’s resistance factor. We here focused on
the potential involvement of autophagy in the process.
Existing studies have displayed feedback activation of
autophagy in many cancer cells following treatment of a
variety of anti-cancer drugs [17–21], which could be a key
resistance factor to inhibit cancer cell death and apoptosis
[17, 21, 22]. Reversely, genetic or pharmacological
inactivation of autophagy could then sensitize the anticancer activity by these anti-cancer drugs [17–22]. In
the current study, we showed that autophagy inhibition
dramatically sensitizes icaritin-induced anti-CRC cell
activity.

The colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been a major
health problem in both Eastern and Western countries
[1–3]. Hence, our group [10] and others [1, 8] have been
focusing on exploring novel anti-CRC agents. Icaritin, the
hydrolytic product of Icariin, is the main active ingredient
of Epimedium, which is a known Traditional Chinese
Medicine [11]. Studies have tested its biological functions
in different experimental settings, including its anti-cancer
activity [12–14]. For instance, icaritin was shown to inhibit
proliferation of prostate cancer cells [12], breast cancer
cells [13], as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
[15] and endometrial cancer cells [16]. Our recent study
has demonstrated that icaritin could also inhibit CRC
cells in vitro and in vivo [10]. At the molecular level, we

Icaritin activates autophagy in human CRC cells

Beclin-1 or ATG-5 shRNA knockdown sensitizes
icaritin-induced cytotoxicity against CRC cells

In order to test the potential effect of icaritin on
autophagy, Western blot assay was performed to test
expression of autophagy-associated proteins in icaritintreated cells. As demonstrated, treatment of icaritin in
HT-29 cells dose-dependently upregulated Beclin-1,
autophagy-related gene-5 (ATG-5) and light chain
3B-II (LC3B-II), but downregulated p62 (Figure 1A).
Meanwhile, the percentage of LC3B-GFP puncta positive
cells, or autophagic cells, was also significantly increased
following icaritin (5–25 μM) treatment (Figure 1B). These
results suggested autophagy activation in HT-29 cells
after icaritin treatment [23–26]. Similarly, in two lines
of primary colon cancer cells (patient-derived), icaritin
(10 μM) treatment induced Beclin-1, ATG-5 and LC3BII upregulation but p62 degradation (Figure 1C). Further,
the number of autophagic cells was also significantly
increased after icaritin treatment in the primary colon
cancer cells (Figure 1D). Thus, these results indicate that
icaritin induces autophagy activation in established and
primary CRC cells.

The above pharmacological evidences suggest
that autophagy activation possibly serves as a potential
resistance factor of icaritin. To exclude the possible offtarget effect of the applied autophagy inhibitors, shRNA
method was utilized to silence key autophagy-associated
proteins, including Beclin-1 [27] and ATG-5 [28]. As
demonstrated in Figure 3A, the two different Beclin-1
shRNAs (“a/b”) both efficiently and stably downregulated
Beclin-1 in HT-29 cells. Similarly, the two specific
shRNAs (“a/b”) [29] also silenced ATG-5 in HT-29 cells
(Figure 3A). Remarkably, icaritin-induced HT-29 cell
viability reduction (Figure 3B), cell death (Figure 3C) and
apoptosis (Figure 3D) were significantly intensified with
Beclin-1 or ATG-5 shRNA knockdown. Yet, knockdown
of these proteins alone showed no significant effect on cell
survival and apoptosis (Figure 3B and 3D). These genetic
evidences further suggest that autophagy inhibition could
sensitize icaritin’s activity in CRC cells.

Autophagy inhibitors potentate icaritin-induced
CRC cell death and apoptosis

Icaritin activates AMPK as upstream of
autophagy in CRC cells

To study the potential effect of autophagy in
icaritin-mediated anti-CRC cell activity, various
autophagy inhibitors were applied, including chloroquine
(Cq), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and 3-methyaldenine
(3-MA). MTT assay results showed that, in the presence
of these autophagy inhibitors, icaritin-induced viability
reduction was significantly potentiated (Figure 2A).
The icaritin’s IC50, the concentration that inhibits
50% of cell viability, decreased from over 20 μM to
less than 5 μM with co-treatment of the autophagy
inhibitors (Figure 2A). icaritin-induced HT-29 cell death,
tested by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release,
was also significantly augmented with the autophagy
inhibitors (Figure 2B). In line with our previous
findings [10], treatment with icaritin (10 μM) alone
failed to induce significant apoptosis activation in HT29 cells (Figure 2C). Remarkably, when combined with
the autophagy inhibitors, icaritin provoked dramatic
apoptosis (Figure 2C), which was tested by the TUNEL
staining assay (Figure 2C). In the primary colon cancer
cells, the above autophagy inhibitors similarly potentiated
icaritin-induced cell viability reduction (Figure 2D).
Thus, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy potentates
icaritin’s cytotoxicity in CRC cells. On the other hand, in
the primary human colon epithelial cells, treatment with
icaritin or together with these autophagy inhibitors failed
to induce significant cell viability reduction (Figure 2E)
and apoptosis (Figure 2F). Thus, icaritin combination

Next, we explored the potential upstream signaling
responsible for autophagy activation by icaritin. Growing
evidences have suggested that AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) activation could provoke autophagy under
a number of stimuli [30–32]. Here, we showed that icaritin
treatment in HT-29 cells dose-dependently induced AMPK
activation, which was tested by phosphorylation (“p”) of
AMPKα (Thr-172) and its major downstream kinase ACC
(acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Ser-79) (Figure 4A). Expression
of regular AMPKα1 and ACC was unchanged following
icaritin treatment (Figure 4A). To study the activity of
AMPK in icaritin-induced autophagy activation, we again
utilized shRNA method to stably knockdown AMPKα1 in
HT-29 cells. As demonstrated, the three targeted-shRNAs
(“a/b/c”) dramatically downregulated AMPKα1 in HT-29
cells (Figure 4B). Consequently, icaritin-induced AMPK
activation, or AMPKα-ACC phosphorylation, was also
dramatically inhibited (Figure 4B). Remarkably, AMPKα1
knockdown almost blocked icaritin-induced autophagy
activation in HT-29 cells (Figure 4C), indicating that
AMPK activation is required for icaritin-induced
autophagy activation.
If AMPK activation is the upstream signaling
for
icaritin-mediated
autophagy
activation,
blockage of AMPK should also potentate icaritin’s
cytotoxicity in CRC cells. Indeed, we showed that
icaritin-induced viability reduction (Figure 4D),
cell death (Figure 4E) and apoptosis (Figure 4F)

AMPK-autophagy activators attenuate icaritin’s
cytotoxicity in CRC cells

were remarkably augmented in AMPKα1-shRNAexpressing HT-29 cells. In another word, AMPKα1
silence could significantly facilitate icaritin-induced
lethality against HT-29 cells (Figure 4D–4F).
In the primary colon cancer cells, siRNA was applied to
temporary knockdown AMPKα1. The targeted siRNA
decreased AMPKα1 expression and inhibited icaritininduced AMPK activation (Figure 4G). Significantly,
icaritin-induced cytotoxicity, or viability reduction, was
also exacerbated with AMPKα1 siRNA knockdown in
the primary cancer cells (Figure 4H). Collectively, these
results indicate that icaritin-induced AMPK activation
serves as the upstream signaling for subsequent autophagy
activation. Reversely, AMPK inactivation by siRNA/
shRNA knockdown of AMPKα1 significantly potentiates
icaritin-induced cytotoxicity in CRC cells.

Based on the results above, we would speculate that
forced-activation of AMPK-autophagy pathway should
attenuate icaritin’s cytotoxicity. In the current study,
an α1 specific AMPK activator Compound 13 (C13)
[33, 34] and an autophagy activator MHY1485 [35] were
utilized. Results showed that pre-treatment of the two
activators indeed inhibited icaritin-induced HT-29 cell
viability reduction (Figure 5A) and cell death (Figure 5B).
Similarly in the primary colon cancer cells, Compound
13 and MHY1485 attenuated icaritin’s lethality (Figure
5C and 5D). Therefore, pharmacologic forced-activation
of AMPK-autophagy pathway attenuates icaritin’s
cytotoxicity in CRC cells.

HT-29 tumor activity (Figure 6B). Notably, there was
no significant difference in the growth of HT-29 tumors
expressing AMPKα1 shRNA or Ctl shRNA (Figure 6A
and 6B). Intriguingly, the mice body weight was not
significantly different among the four groups (Figure 6C),
neither did we notice any apparent toxicities. These results
imply that these nude mice were well-tolerated to the
above treatment regimens. When analyzing tumor tissue
lysate samples, we showed that AMPKα1 was indeed
silenced in HT-29 tumors expressing AMPKα1 shRNA-a
(Figure 6D, quantified data of three repeats). Meanwhile,
icaritin-induced autophagy activation, evidenced by strong
Beclin-1 expression, was also significantly attenuated with
AMPKα1 shRNA knockdown (Figure 6D, quantified data
of three repeats). These results indicate that activation of

anti-HT-29 tumor activity in vivo
Above in vitro studies imply that AMPK-autophagy
inhibition could sensitize icaritin’s anti-CRC cell activity.
We next tested this hypothesis in vivo, using the HT29 xenograft model [10]. Tumor growth curve results
in Figure 6A demonstrated that oral administration of
icaritin (10 mg/kg, daily, for 21 days) in the nude mice
inhibited growth of HT-29 xenografts with scramble
non-sense control shRNA (“Ctl shRNA”). Remarkably,
icaritin-induced anti-tumor activity was dramatically
potentiated in HT-29 tumors with AMPKα1 shRNA-a
(Figure 6A). Daily tumor growth results further confirmed
that AMPKα1 silence sensitized icaritin-mediated anti-

proteins [36]. On the other hand, 3-methyladenine (3-MA)
inhibits LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion, and inhibits
autophagosome initiation [37]. Here, treatment of these
autophagy inhibitors dramatically potentiated icaritininduced lethality against primary and established CRC
cells. More intriguingly, pharmacological autophagy

inhibition could restore CRC cell apoptosis following
icaritin treatment. Therefore, feedback autophagy
activation could be a primary reason of non-apoptosis
induction in icaritin-treated CRC cells, as reported in
our previous study [10]. Inhibition of autophagy then reprovokes apoptosis with icaritin treatment in CRC cells.
In the process of autophagy, autophagosome, the
double-membrane structure, will enclose the cellular
components [17, 21, 22]. These autophagosomes will

then be fused within lysosome to digest the enclosed
components, and to supply nutrients for cell survival
and apoptosis prevention [17, 21, 22]. Both ATG-5 and
Beclin-1 [27] are indispensable for autophagosome
formation [17, 21, 22]. In the current study, we showed
that shRNA stable knockdown of ATG-5 or Beclin-1,
which presumably blocked autophagy progression,
dramatically potentiated icaritin-induced CRC cell death
and apoptosis. These genetic evidences further confirm

that feedback autophagy activation serves as a primary
resistance factor of icaritin in CRC cells.
AMPK is a metabolic switcher that senses change
in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio [38]. Recent studies
have proposed a key function of AMPK in the activation
of autophagy [31]. There are at least two ways for AMPK
to activate autophagy. AMPK phosphorylates and activates
its downstream Ulk1, the latter is able to initiate cell
autophagy [39, 40]. Secondly, AMPK phosphorylates

and in-activates TSC2, which then leads to mTORC1
(mTOR complex 1) inhibition [41, 42]. Activation of
mTORC1 will silence autophagy, and AMPK-induced
mTORC1 inactivation could then provoke autophagy
[39, 40]. Here, we found that icaritin activated AMPK
cascade in CRC cells, which served as the upstream
signaling for autophagy. Blockage of AMPK activation
by AMPKα1 shRNA/siRNA largely inhibited icaritininduced autophagy activation, yet exacerbating CRC

for 21 consecutive days; Tumor volume (A) and mice body weight (C) were recorded every 10 days for a total of 40 days; Tumor daily
growth was also calculated (B). Day-5 after initial ICT administration, HT-29 tumors of three mice of ICT treatment group were isolated,
expression of listed proteins in fresh tumor lysates was tested, and results were quantified (D, three repeats). Data were expressed as mean

cell death and apoptosis. In nude mice, AMPKα1 shRNA
knockdown in HT-29 tumors facilitated icaritin-induced
inhibition on tumor growth. Thus, AMPK activation
mediates autophagy induction and icaritin resistance in
CRC cells. Further studies will be needed to explore the
underlying mechanisms of AMPK activation by icaritin,
and how activated-AMPK provokes autophagy in icaritintreated cells.
In summary, our results suggest that feedback
activation of AMPK-autophagy cascade could be a major
resistance factor of icaritin in CRC cells. Blockage of this
signaling dramatically sensitizes icaritin-induced antiCRC cell activity in vitro and in vivo.

was initiated 14 days post tumor cell inoculation, when
established tumors were around 100 mm3 in volume.
Treatment protocol was described. Tumor volumes were
measured every 10 days by the modified ellipsoid formula:
(π / 6) × AB2 , and A is the longest and B is the shortest
perpendicular axis of a tumor mass [10].

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed
by a Scheffe’s f-test by using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Significance was chosen as p < 0.05.
IC-50 was also calculated by SPSS 18.0.
