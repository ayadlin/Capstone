Androgens are known to protect prostate cancer cells from DNA damage. Recent studies showed regulation of DNA repair genes by
androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancers. ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) is an androgen-regulated tumor suppressor and its
intracellular localization can be modulated by ultraviolet light, suggesting a potential role for EAF2 in androgen regulation of
DNA repair in prostate cancer cells. Here we show that knockdown of EAF2 or its homolog EAF1 sensitized prostate cancer cells to
DNA damage and the sensitization did not require p53. EAF2 knockout mouse prostate was also sensitized to γ-irradiation.
Furthermore, EAF2 knockdown blocked androgen repression of LNCaP or C4-2 cells from doxorubicin induction of γH2ax, a DNA
damage marker. In human prostate cancer specimens, EAF2 expression was inversely correlated with the level of γH2ax. Further
analysis showed that EAF2 and EAF1 are required for the recruitment and retention of Ku70/Ku80 to DNA damage sites and play a
functional role in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair. These ﬁndings provide evidence for EAF2 as a key factor mediating
androgen protection of DNA damage via Ku70/Ku80 in prostate cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second
leading cause of cancer deaths in US males.1 The standard
treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer is androgen
deprivation therapy that is known to enhance radiation therapy of
prostate cancer and prolong patient survival.2,3 Although the
mechanisms of enhancement are poorly understood and studies
on interaction between androgen receptor (AR) signaling and
DNA damage repair are limited, several recent studies have
provided new insight into the mechanisms of androgen regulation
of DNA repair. Androgen deprivation therapy can sensitize
AR-positive prostate cancer cells to DNA damage in both culture
and xenografts.4–6 Using RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, Polkinghorn et al.5 showed that
AR directly regulates the expression of DNA repair genes.
In addition, some AR target genes such as NKX3.1 can modulate
DNA damage response.7–10 Interestingly, DNA repair proteins such
as PARP1 can also act as AR cofactors regulating AR signaling,
suggesting a potential positive feedback loop between
AR signaling and DNA repair genes. The regulation of DNA repair
by AR signaling appears to be complex and identiﬁcation of
factors involved would help further understanding of the
enhancement of radiotherapy by androgen deprivation therapy
for prostate cancer patients.
Our previous studies11–13 identiﬁed an androgen upregulated
gene 19 (U19), also known as ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2), as a
tumor suppressor in the prostate that is frequently downregulated
in prostate cancer. Multiple strains of EAF2 knockout mice
developed prostatic defects including epithelial hyperplasia and
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia,14–16 the putative
1

precursor of prostate cancer. In mice, EAF2 inactivation on a Pten
heterozygous background induced prostate cancer development
and progression, and EAF2 and Pten co-downregulation occurred
in over 50% clinical prostate specimens with higher Gleason
scores.17 The ultraviolet light-induced EAF2 intracellular localization and EAF2 knockout mouse lens cells displayed increased
sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation-induced apoptosis,18,19 implicating a potential role for EAF2 in DNA damage response. However,
the relationship between EAF2 and DNA damage response and
repair remains to be determined.
Here, we report a novel function of EAF2, along with its
homolog EAF1, in DNA damage repair via the recruitment and
retention of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway proteins
Ku70/Ku80 to damaged DNA. Loss of EAF2 sensitized human
prostate cancer cells and mouse prostate to DNA damage. In
human prostate cancer specimens, EAF2 expression was inversely
correlated with the level of DNA damage marker γH2ax.
Our studies also suggested that EAF2 plays an important role in
androgen regulation of DNA damage repair. These ﬁndings
provide new insights into the role of EAF2 in prostate
carcinogenesis as well as in androgen regulation of DNA damage
repair in the prostate.

obtained using doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dx) to induce DSBs23
(Supplementary Figures S1C and D). These data indicate that both
EAF1 and EAF2 play a role in the repair of DNA DSBs in prostate
cancer cells.
Knockout of EAF2 sensitizes mouse prostate to DNA damage
The role of EAF2 in protecting cells upon damage was next analyzed in
the mouse prostate. EAF2 knockout24 and wild-type C57BL/6J mice
were irradiated at a whole-body dose of 8 Gy γ-irradiation and γH2ax
levels were evaluated. As shown in Figure 1c, EAF2 knockout anterior
prostates exhibited higher γH2ax levels than wild-type controls 24 h
after irradiation, indicating that EAF2 knockout enhanced susceptibility
of the prostate to DNA damage. Furthermore, EAF2 knockout mice
subjected to 5 Gy whole-body irradiation at 8 weeks of age exhibited
dramatically increased epithelial proliferation, atypical hyperplasia and
decreased the latency of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions from
12 to 24 months of age15,17 to as early as 19 weeks of age when
compared with nonirradiated controls (Figures 1d and e). Thus, EAF2 is
important for radiation protection in vivo.
EAF2 downregulation correlates with γH2ax upregulation in
human prostate cancer specimens
To determine the potential association of EAF2 downregulation with
increased DNA damage response in prostate carcinogenesis, we tested
whether EAF2 downregulation correlated with γH2ax expression by
immunostaining human prostate cancer specimens with Gleason
scores 6–9 and matched nonmalignant adjacent tissues and in a tissue
microarray (Figure 2a). We found downregulation of EAF2 and
enhanced γH2ax in prostate cancer specimens compared with
nonmalignant adjacent tissues (Figures 2b and c). Semiquantitative
analysis of immunostaining intensity revealed an inverse relationship
between EAF2 and γH2ax in human prostate specimens (Figure 2d).
Increased γH2ax (H-Score ⩾ 5) immunostaining was detected in 29 of
122 prostate cancer specimens with decreased EAF2 (H-Score o150),
whereas γH2ax immunostaining was detected in only 1 of the 95
specimens with EAF2 expression (H-Score ⩾ 150) (Figure 2d); the
difference was statistically signiﬁcant (Po0.0001). These ﬁndings
suggest that EAF2 downregulation was required for the increased
γH2ax expression.
Overexpression of EAF1 protects prostate cancer cells from DNA
damage
As downregulation of EAF family proteins sensitized cells to DNA
damage, we examined the effects of overexpression of EAF family
proteins on LNCaP cells exposed to DNA damage. We established
LNCaP cells with stable overexpression of GFP-EAF1 (LNCaP/GFPEAF1) or GFP (LNCaP/GFP). When compared with LNCaP/GFP in a
Dx dose–response study using γH2ax as a marker of DNA damage,
LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells were less sensitive to Dx-induced DNA
damage (Figure 3a). EAF2 is a multifunction protein that induces
apoptosis,13 and hence we were unable to stably overexpress GFPEAF2 in the LNCaP cell line.13 As the critical DNA damage sensor
p5325,26 binds to EAF2,24 we examined whether EAF1 overexpression could modulate p53 induction in response to DNA
damage. However, no difference was detected in the dose
response of Dx induction of p53 protein between LNCaP/GFP
and LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells (Figure 3a), suggesting that EAF1
overexpression does not inﬂuence p53 protein stabilization upon
DNA damage induction. EAF1 knockdown in p53-negative PC3
cells enhanced γ2ax levels upon Dx treatment (Figure 3b), further
suggesting that EAF1 can enhance DNA repair and that EAF family
protein modulation of DNA repair does not require p53. Knockdown of GFP-EAF1 in LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells using two different
siRNAs separately enhanced γH2ax levels when cells were treated
with 0.4 μg/ml of Dx (Figure 3c), indicating that GFP-EAF1
Oncogene (2017) 2054 – 2065

overexpression was indeed responsible for protecting LNCaP/
GFP-EAF1 cells from DNA damage.
Decreased γH2ax levels in response to Dx in GFP-EAF1-expressing
cells might be associated with efﬁcient repair of DNA damage.
To test whether this was the case, DSBs were induced by Dx in
LNCaP/GFP and LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells that were then allowed to
recover for 25 h. As shown in Figure 3d, at the same dosage,
Dx induced less γH2ax expression in LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells compared with controls. γH2ax virtually disappeared 25 h after cells were
switched to fresh medium, consistent with GFP-EAF1 enhancement
of DNA damage repair. When LNCaP/GFP and LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells
were treated with Dx at 0.5 and 0.8 μg/ml, respectively, the γH2ax
level induced in LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells was higher than that in
LNCaP/GFP cells (Figure 3e). However, γH2ax still disappeared faster
(within 48 h) in LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells after Dx removal when
compared with LNCaP/GFP cells (over 60 h) (Figure 3e).
EAF2 knockdown inhibits androgen protection against DNA
damage
Androgen signaling has been shown to accelerate the repair of
DNA damage.5 EAF2 knockdown in LNCaP cells resulted in an
increased sensitivity to Dx-induced cytotoxicity (Figure 3f).
As EAF2 is encoded by an androgen-responsive gene,12,13 the
effects of androgens on DNA damage repair following the
knockdown of EAF2 in prostate cancer cells was determined.
Knockdown of EAF2 in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells resulted in
higher γH2ax levels in cells treated with Dx in both the presence
and absence of androgens (Figures 3g and h).
EAF family proteins protect LNCaP cells from doxorubicin-induced
cell death
Cells overexpressing EAF1 exhibited lower γH2ax levels compared
with controls in response to DNA damage, indicating they might
be resistant to Dx-induced cytotoxicity. As expected, Dx treatment
induced a lower level of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(c-PARP), an apoptosis marker,27 in LNCaP/GFP-EAF1 cells as
compared with LNCaP/GFP controls (Supplementary Figure S2A).
This was consistent with lower γH2ax levels detected in LNCaP/
GFP-EAF1 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Knockdown of EAF1
in PC3 cells reversed the above phenotype (Supplementary
Figure S2B). Flow cytometry analysis further conﬁrmed that
knockdown of EAF1 and/or EAF2 sensitized LNCaP cells to
Dx-induced cell death, with double knockdown having the most
dramatic effect (Supplementary Figure S2C).
Knockdown of EAF1 impairs NHEJ repair
Mammalian cells have evolved the NHEJ- and the homologous
recombination (HR)-directed pathways to repair DSBs in DNA.28–31
Thus, we utilized the previously established H1299dA3-1#1 and
Hela pDR-GFP32 cell models to test the role of EAF proteins in
these two DSB repair pathways. Brieﬂy, H1299 dA3-1#1 cells
carrying a stably integrated DNA fragment with two recognition
sites for the I-SceI endonuclease were subjected to DSB induction
by transient expression of I-SceI. Restriction digestion at the two
I-SceI sites followed by NHEJ excision of the TK gene enables
expression of the enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) gene
driven by an upstream cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter32 that
provides a quantitative measurement of DNA repair events. In the
Hela pDR-GFP HR assay,32 two differentially mutated GFP genes,
a GFP gene harboring a single I-SceI site with in-frame stop
codons, SceGFP, and a downstream internal GFP fragment (iGFP),
can undergo a gene conversion event upon I-SceI transfection,
resulting in the expression of intact GFP protein that can be
measured by C6 ﬂow cytometry. Endogenous EAF2 expression
was very low in H1299dA3-1#1 and was not detectable in Hela
pDR-GFP cells. Fortunately, both cell lines expressed EAF1 at levels

comparable to LNCaP cells (data not shown), providing an
opportunity to test the effect of EAF1 depletion on DSB repair in
chromosomal DNA. Knockdown of EAF1 reduced the percentage of
GFP-positive cells compared with cells treated with siRNA control
(Figure 4a), indicating that EAF1 was required for efﬁcient NHEJ.
Using the Hela pDR-GFP-based assay for HR repair,33 no signiﬁcant
difference was detected in the percentage of GFP-positive cells
between siEAF1-treated and siRNA control groups (Figure 4b),
indicating that EAF1 may not affect the HR repair pathway.
EAF family proteins bind to and co-accumulate with Ku70/Ku80
proteins at sites of DNA damage
As EAF family proteins could modulate NHEJ of DSBs and prostate
epithelial cells have been shown to undergo repair predominantly

by the NHEJ pathway in response to irradiation,31 we tested
whether EAF1 and EAF2 accumulated at DSBs induced by laser
microirradiation in LNCaP cells. GFP-EAF1 and GFP-EAF2 protein
accumulated at sites of DNA damage induced by 405 nm laser
microirradiation (Figure 5) and the accumulation occurred very
rapidly in ∼ 10 s after the microirradiation (Supplementary
Figure S3). The core NHEJ machinery consists of DNA-dependent
protein kinase and the ligase IV/XRCC4/XLF complex.34,35
The Ku70/80 heterodimer is the DNA binding component of
DNA-dependent protein kinase, and forms a ring that can
speciﬁcally bind to exposed broken DNA ends.36,37 Formation of
the Ku heterodimer is an early and upstream event of NHEJ.38
Inactivation of Ku70 or Ku80 in mice leads to multiple defects
including hypersensitivity to radiation and malignant
transformation.39,40 Considering the importance of Ku70 and

EAF2 regulates DNA repair in the prostate

2058
Ku80 heterodimers in NHEJ repair, we also tested whether EAF
family proteins and Ku proteins co-accumulated at DSB sites.
As shown in Figure 5, both GFP-EAF1 and GFP-EAF2
co-accumulated at DSB sites with RFP-Ku70 and RFP-Ku80. All
four proteins responded to microirradiation within seconds,
preventing us from distinguishing the order of their accumulation
at DSBs.

Oncogene (2017) 2054 – 2065

Colocalization of proteins is often indicative of their physical
interaction. Using HEK293 cells transfected with various
combinations of GFP-Ku70, GFP-K80, Myc-EAF1 and HA-EAF2
plasmids, we found that both Ku70 and Ku80 coimmunoprecipitated with transfected EAF1 and EAF2 proteins, both
in the absence and presence of Dx (Figures 6a and b).
Nuclear extracts prepared from LNCaP cells with and without Dx

treatment were also immunoprecipitated with EAF1 or EAF2 that
showed endogenous Ku70 and Ku80 co-precipitation with endogenous EAF proteins (Figures 6c and d). These results further suggest
that EAF1 and EAF2 physically interact with Ku70 and Ku80 in the
nucleus.
Knockdown of EAF family proteins impairs recruitment of Ku70/
Ku80 at sites of DSBs
Recruitment of Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimers to DSBs is a key step
to initiate NHEJ.36,37 As EAF1 knockdown impaired NHEJ (see
Figure 4), we examined the effect of EAF1 and EAF2 knockdown
on Ku70 and Ku80 recruitment in response to laser microirradiation. Knockdown of EAF1 and/or EAF2 inhibited Ku70 accumulation and retention at DSB sites dramatically in LNCaP cells
(Figure 7a). Similar results were obtained for Ku80 recruitment and
retention at DSBs, although the inhibition was less dramatic than
that for Ku70 (Figure 7b). As a control, we showed that knockdown
of EAF1 and/or EAF2 did not affect the levels of Ku70 and Ku80
proteins (Supplementary Figure S4A). The impaired recruitment of
Ku proteins to DNA damage sites upon EAF1 knockdown was
rescued by re-expression of an EAF1 transgene insensitive to
siEAF1 in LNCaP cells (Figures 7c–e), suggesting that the effect of
NHEJ assay

siEAF1 on recruitment of Ku proteins was indeed mediated
through EAF1 knockdown. Similar results were obtained when
another independent siEAF2 sequence was used to knock down
EAF2, further arguing that the siEAF2 effect on Ku proteins was
mediated through EAF2 knockdown (Supplementary Figures
S4B–D). Taken as a whole, these data strongly indicate that
EAF family proteins work together with Ku proteins in regulation
of DNA damage response.
DISCUSSION
Our studies here provide evidence for EAF2 and its homolog EAF1
being key regulators of DNA damage repair in the prostate. First,
knockdown of EAF family proteins sensitized prostate cancer cells
and murine prostate to DNA damage (Figure 1) and the
sensitization did not require p53 (Figure 3). Second, downregulation of EAF2 protein in prostate cancer specimens was
correlated with elevated expression of DNA damage response
marker γH2ax (Figure 2). Third, EAF2 knockdown inhibited
androgen protection against DNA damage (Figure 3). Finally, we
found that EAF family proteins could modulate NHEJ of DSBs,
and were required for the recruitment and retention of DNA
repair proteins Ku70/Ku80 at DNA damage sites (Figures 4–7).

These ﬁndings suggest that EAF family proteins work with Ku70/

pathway for DSBs in mammalian cells, providing mechanistic
insights into androgen regulation of DNA repair in prostate
cancer cells.

Our study testiﬁes further that phosphorylated H2ax (γH2ax) is a
reliable marker for evaluating DNA damage in prostate cancer.

increased DNA damage-induced cell death upon knockdown of
EAF proteins further supports this conclusion. Thus, the elevated
γH2ax level induced by γ-irradiation in EAF2 knockout prostate
(Figure 1c) would reﬂect that EAF2 knockout prostate was more
sensitive to γ-irradiation-induced DNA damage. Similarly, the
inverse correlation of EAF2 expression with γH2ax protein level in
human prostate cancer specimens (Figures 2a and b) suggests
that downregulated expression of EAF2 would permit elevated
DNA damage in prostate cancer cells when these cells were
subjected to genotoxicity.
The dramatic decrease in latency of prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia lesions in EAF2 knockout prostate following γ-irradiation
substantiated the importance of EAF2 in prostatic DNA damage
repair. The hypersensitivity of EAF2 knockout prostate to
γ-irradiation is unlikely mediated through neoplastic transformation secondary to EAF2 knockout because prostate carcinogenesis
was shown to be insensitive to either low- or high-dose radiation
in the TRAMP mouse model.41 Furthermore, Ku protein deletion
was reported to enhance sensitivity to irradiation in the mouse
model.42,43 Cumulatively, these ﬁndings suggest that hypersensitivity to irradiation in EAF2 knockout prostate is mediated through
the Ku protein-dependent pathways.

Regulation of DNA repair by EAF family proteins through
Ku70 and Ku80 proteins is supported by the association between
EAF proteins and Ku70/Ku80 proteins in the same complex and
their rapid co-accumulation at the DSB following microirradiation.
This model is further indicated by the inhibition of Ku70/Ku80
recruitment at the DSB sites upon EAF1 and/or EAF2 knockdown
(Figure 7). It is worth pointing out that knockdown of EAF1 and/or
EAF2 did not change expression levels of Ku70 and Ku80 proteins
(Supplementary Figure S4). This suggests that reduced Ku protein
accumulation and retention at DSBs upon EAF knockdown was
not due to reduced Ku protein expression. Given the demonstrated importance of Ku70/Ku80 complex in the NHEJ repair
mechanism, when EAF2 is downregulated, inhibition of Ku protein
recruitment at DSBs would impair DNA repair and subsequently
lead to genomic DNA mutations and/or deletions that are key
steps in carcinogenesis.
The present study suggests that EAF1 and EAF2 are not
functionally redundant in the regulation of Ku proteins and DNA
damage repair, although EAF1 and EAF2 are two closely related
homologs. Knockdown of either factor impaired the recruitment
and retention of Ku proteins and DNA damage response and
repair. One potential mechanism for the non-redundant function
of EAF1 or EAF2 is that both EAF1 and EAF2 are required

simultaneously for the efﬁcient recruitment and retention of
Ku70/Ku80. Alternatively, EAF1 and EAF2 are functionally identical
in the recruitment of Ku70/Ku80 and the efﬁcient recruitment and
retention of Ku70/Ku80 requires a certain threshold level of
EAF proteins. siRNA knockdown of either EAF protein would
reduce the level of total EAF proteins below the required
threshold. We were unable to investigate whether EAF1 downregulation correlated with γH2ax upregulation in human prostate
cancer specimens (Figure 2) because of the lack of an EAF1
antibody suitable for immunohistochemistry. Although the role of
EAF1 in prostate carcinogenesis remains to be established, our
study demonstrates the importance of EAF1 as well as EAF2 in
regulating DNA repair in prostate cells. The contributions of EAF1
and EAF2 individually and in combination in DNA damage
repair and in prostate carcinogenesis will be further analyzed in
future studies.
EAF2 can affect multiple important pathways in prostate
carcinogenesis via various binding partners. EAF proteins play
important roles in transcription and transcription elongation.44
Regulation of Ku protein recruitment and retention at the DSB
sites by EAF family proteins suggests a potential link between
DNA damage response and transcription. This also provides an
opportunity to explore the crosstalk of DNA repair with the
transcription and transcription elongation machinery. ELL/EAF
proteins also bind to MED26, a component of the human mediator
that plays a key role in transcriptional activation of multiple
genes.45 EAF proteins have additional binding partners, including
pVHL and p53.24,46 EAF2 deletion upregulated the protein level of
Hif-1α, a pVHL target protein, and enhanced angiogenesis46,47 that
also could contribute to prostate carcinogenesis. As p53 is a key
tumor suppressor involved in multiple cancers including prostate
cancer,48 inactivation of EAF2 could also modulate p53 signaling
pathways and subsequently promote prostate carcinogenesis.
Furthermore, EAF2 knockout enhanced phosphorylation of ERK,
another key regulator of carcinogenesis.24,46 EAF2 could also
negatively regulate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.49 Therefore, impaired DNA damage repair and multiple altered signaling
pathways upon EAF2 deletion/downregulation could act synergistically to promote prostate carcinogenesis.
Our studies reveal an important role of EAF2 in androgen
regulation of DNA repair in the prostate. As EAF2 expression is
androgen dependent, EAF2 provides a mechanistic link between
androgen signaling and DNA repair via Ku70/Ku80. This is
supported by the observation that androgen protection
against DNA damage in LNCaP and C4-2 cells was inhibited by
EAF2 knockdown. Given the importance of EAF2 in DNA damage
repair, downregulation of EAF2 is likely an important mechanism
leading to radiation sensitization by androgen deprivation
therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
siRNAs, transfection and immunoblotting
EAF1 and EAF2 knockdown in cells was performed using siRNA transfected
in OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) via Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the recommended siRNA
dosages by the manufacturer’s instructions. Western analyses were
conducted as described in Supplementary Experimental Procedures with
antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Comet assay
LNCaP cells were treated with siRNA for 48 h, then treated with γ-irradiation or
doxorubicin and collected for DNA damage analysis. DNA damage was
quantiﬁed using a neutral comet assay (Comet Assay Kit, Trevigen,
Gaithersburgh, MD, USA).

Flow cytometry
LNCaP cells were treated with siRNA for 48 h followed by treatment with
various concentrations of Dx for additional 20 h, in the presence of 1 nM of
dihydrotestosterone to induce EAF2 expression. Cells were then collected
and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and ﬁxed in
70% ethanol at 4 °C for overnight. Cells were washed again twice with cold
PBS and resuspended in PBS containing RNase (100 μg/ml) and propidium
iodide (50 μg/ml) 30 min before analysis. Experiments were repeated a
minimum of two times.

NHEJ and HR assay
H1299 dA3-1#1, a subline of human lung cancer cells generated by
transfecting a plasmid DNA containing two I-SceI sites into H1299 cells,
was used as a model to assay for NHEJ of chromosomal DSBs. HeLa pDRGFP cells containing a recombination substrate DR-GFP were used to assay
for HR frequency of chromosomal DNA.50 pCMV-NLS-I-SceI expression
vector was introduced by transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
into 1.5 × 105 H1299 dA3-1#1 cells (for NHEJ) or 3.0 × 105 HeLa pDR-GFP
cells (for HR) pre-transfected with siRNA for 48 h using Lipofectamin 2000
(Invitrogen). For ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells
were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS and applied to the
FACS caliber apparatus (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). EGFPpositive cells were counted using Cellquest software (Cellquest Company,
San Jose, CA, USA).

Laser microirradiation
LNCaP cells were treated with 100 μM 8-methoxypsoralen and subjected to
laser irradiation as previously described.51

Immunoprecipitation
To immunoprecipitate GFP-tagged proteins, whole-cell lysates and
anti-GFP tag agarose beads (MBL, Woburn, MA, USA) were combined
and incubated. Nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-EAF1 or antiEAF2 antibodies, or normal mouse IgG and protein A/G PLUS-Agarose
beads. Eluted proteins were electrophoresed and analyzed by immunoblot
as described previously52 and in Supplementary Experimental Procedures
with antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1.

γ-Irradiation of mice

Wild-type and EAF2− / − male mice on a C57BL/6J background24 were
subjected to whole-body γ-irradiation. The use and care of mice were
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.
See Supplementary Experimental Procedures for details.

Histological and pathological analysis
Human primary prostate specimens included 16 specimens with Gleason
scores 6–9 and normal adjacent tissues as well as a tissue microarray
composed of 120 prostate cancer specimens with Gleason scores 6–9, 20
benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens and 80 matched normal adjacent
specimens. Slides were immunostained and blindly evaluated by a
pathologist using a semiquantitative analysis of EAF2 and γH2ax staining
as previously described.15 See Supplementary Experimental Procedures
with antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1 for details.

Statistics
Comparisons between groups were calculated using Student’s t-test, the
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test method of summing small P-values, the
one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test as appropriate. A value of Po0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. GraphPad Prism version 6 was used for graphics (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Values are expressed as means ± s.e.m.
or mean ± s.d.
