ABSTRACT
Despite the clinical benefit of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, multiple
myeloma (MM) patients invariably relapse through poorly defined mechanisms.
Myeloma cells inevitably develop chemoresistance that leads to disease relapse
and patient-related deaths. Studies in tumor cell lines and biopsies obtained from
patients refractory to therapy have revealed that myeloma cells adapt to stress
by inducing expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) chaperone with anti-apoptotic properties. Treatment of myeloma cells
with bortezomib increased GRP78 levels and activated GRP78-dependent autophagy.
Expression profiling indicated that GRP78-encoding HSPA5 was significantly
upregulated in bortezomib-resistant cells. Co-treatment with the anti-diabetic
agent metformin suppressed GRP78 and enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of
bortezomib. Bortezomib treatment led to GRP78 co-localization with proteotoxic
protein aggregates, known as aggresomes. Pharmacologic suppression, genetic
ablation or mutational inactivation of GRP78 followed by bortezomib treatment led to
the accumulation of aggresomes but impaired autophagy and enhanced anti-myeloma
effect of bortezomib. GRP78 was co-immunoprecipitated with the KDEL receptor, an
ER quality control regulator that binds proteins bearing the KDEL motif to mediate
their retrieval from the Golgi complex back to the ER. Taken together, we demonstrate
that inhibition of GRP78 functional activity disrupts autophagy and enhances the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib.

INTRODUCTION

lenalidomide, have extended overall survival (OS) to a
median of ~7 years [7, 8]. Moreover, integration of novel
agents into consolidation and maintenance therapy has
further increased depth of response, including molecular
complete responses, prolonged progression-free survival
and OS. However, all MM patients eventually relapse and
new molecular targets and more effective therapeutics
represent an urgent, unmet need.
Drug resistance, either de novo or acquired, remains
a significant obstacle in myeloma treatment [9, 10]. Our
current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic bases of
therapeutic resistance remains poorly understood [11]. The
ubiquitin (Ub)+proteasome system (UPS) is a complex
protein network that maintains proteostasis through
the selective degradation of misfolded, aggregated and
short-lived proteins [12,13]. The proteasome serves as
the catalytic core of the UPS to efficiently remove Ubconjugated proteins and to maintain cell viability. The
pivotal role of the proteasome in maintaining proteostasis
has been exploited therapeutically to promote tumor cell
death [14-16]. Bortezomib has emerged as the standardof-care therapy for MM and catapulted the UPS into
a position of prominence in cancer biology and drug
development [14-18]. However, the mechanistic bases of
resistance remains poorly understood.
Cancer cells adapt to proteasome inhibitors
through induction of compensatory protein clearance
mechanisms, e.g., aggresomes and autophagosomes,
leading to the generation of drug resistance, therapeutic
failure and disease relapse. Aggresomes are peri-nuclear
structures formed in response to cellular stresses, such
as hyperthermia, overexpression of insoluble or mutant
protein and UPS inhibitors, that generate misfolded or
partially denatured protein [19-21]. Histone deactylase
(HDAC)6 and the microtubule-based motor protein,
dynein, promote aggresome formation as a cytoprotective
response that sequesters potentially cytotoxic protein
aggregates. These structures then serve as a staging center
for the delivery of protein aggregates to autophagosomes
and eventual lysosomal removal.
ER stress induces autophagosome formation and
has been shown to require components of the unfolded
protein response (UPR) [22]. The glucose-regulated
protein and molecular chaperone GRP78, is a major target
upregulated during the UPR [22-24]. GRP78 is involved
in translocating newly synthesized polypeptides across
the ER membrane, facilitating their folding and assembly,
maintaining proteins in a state competent for subsequent
folding and oligomerization [25, 26]. GRP78 is also
required for stress-induced autophagy [22-25]. Here, we
reveal that GRP78 is required for the efficient delivery
of bortezomib-induced aggresomes to autophagosomes
and that targeting GRP78 holds promise as a strategy to
overcome drug resistance in myeloma.

Expression of GRP78-encoding HSPA5 in MM
patients and bortezomib-resistant cells
The molecular chaperone GRP78 is induced under
stress conditions such as glucose starvation, hypoxia
and oxidative stress, which are characteristic of the
tumor microenvironment. Levels of GRP78 are elevated
in a variety of tumors, including prostate, lung, breast,
colon and gastric tumors, myeloma and leukemias and
GRP78 expression is inversely correlated with cancer
patient survival [22, 23, 27]. A prior study analyzed bone
marrow samples from 10 patients with Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia (WM), 12 with MM and 11 with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to show that HSPA5
expression was increased relative to normal PCs obtained
from healthy donors in these plasma cell disorders
(GSE66910) [28]. We performed expression analysis to
determine whether HSPA5 expression was upregulated
in patients with the pre-malignant condition monoclonal
gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) that
nearly uniformly precedes MM. Approximately 1-2% of
MGUS patients per year will progress to develop MM
and then require therapy. HSPA5, which encodes GRP78,
was the HSP most significantly increased HSP-encoding
gene detected in MM patient samples compared to MGUS
samples (Figure 1A, top panel). Bortezomib resistant
myeloma cells were then generated by treating RPMI8226
myeloma cells with either vehicle (0.5% DMSO) or
successively increased concentrations of bortezomib.
After six months of bortezomib exposure, drug exposed
cells were 5-10 fold less sensitive to the proteasome
inhibitor than the drug-naïve parental cells based upon
IC50 values [18]. HSPA5 expression was significantly
upregulated in bortezomib-resistant cells (Figure 1A,
bottom panel) and western blotting indicated that GRP78
was increased in bortezomib resistant cells compared to
drug-naïve cells (Figure 1B). We reasoned that GRP78
upregulation could promote drug resistance through
the induction of autophagy as a mechanism to eradicate
potentially proteotoxic aggresomes. Activation of the
UPR induces autophagy as a homeostatic mechanism
triggered in response to misfolded protein accumulation
in the ER lumen [29-31]. Bortezomib (10nM) treatment
of myeloma cells led to a dramatic induction of GRP78
that accumulated near the cell membrane as shown by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confocal microscopy
(Figure 1C, D). Physiologic concentrations of metformin
have been shown to suppress the UPR [32-35]. Since
bortezomib induced GRP78 and metformin had been
reported to target GRP78, we determined the metformin
(1mM) effect on GRP78 levels combined with bortezomib
(10nM) treatment. While bortezomib treatment alone

significantly increased GRP78, metformin alone or cotreatment with bortezomib suppressed GRP78. The
bortezomib effect on GRP78 was maximal at 10nM and
the metformin effect was observed at 1 to 4mM (Figure
1E).
To investigate the role of GRP78 in aggresome
formation, RPMI8226 cells were transfected with
scrambled (control) shRNA or shRNA to inactivate
HSPA5. Western blot indicated that shRNA to target
HSPA5 significantly reduced the level of GRP78 (Figure
2A). IHC and confocal microscopy indicated that
bortezomib treatment significantly increased GRP78 in
control-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with
HSPA5-specific shRNA (Figure 2B). Metformin, alone
or combined with bortezomib, suppressed the GRP78

induction (Figure 2B). However, bortezomib or metformin
treatment of cells transfected with either control or
HSPA5-specific shRNA led to a significant increase in
aggresomes detected by using the proteostat dye-based
method (P<0.0001 for both Figure 2C, D). Aggresome
formation in control cells treated with bortezomib was
increased 11-fold compared to untreated cells (P<0.001),
metformin treatment increased aggresomes by 8-fold
compared to untreated cells (P<0.004) and bortezomib
co-treatment with metformin increased aggresomes by 41fold compared to untreated cells (P<0.0001). The results
indicated that GRP78 upregulation was not essential for
bortezomib-induced aggresome formation.
In addition to its chaperoning function, GRP78 is
also a key regulator of the ER stress transducers inositol-

requiring 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6
(ATF6) and dsRNA-activated protein kinase-like ER
kinase (PERK). GRP78 binds and inhibits IRE1, ATF6 and
PERK activation in non-stressed cells [22-24]. Upon ER
stress and misfolded protein accumulation in the ER, these
molecules are released from GRP78 and become activated.
The effect of bortezomib on GRP78 upregulation was
observed in cells transfected with shRNA to inactivate
either IRE1, ATF6 or PERK to suggest that the effect of
bortezomib on GRP78 was independent of the three ER
stress transducers (Figure 2E). Western blot confirmed
that GRP78 levels were upregulated by bortezomib and
that co-treatment with metformin suppressed the induction
(Figure 2F).
Bortezomib treatment of myeloma cells significantly
increased not only GRP78 and aggresomes but also

autophagosomes (Figure 3A). Treatment with metformin
alone or co-treatment with bortezomib significantly
increased aggresomes as well. However, metformin or
co-treatment with bortezomib did not induce GRP78 or
autophagosome levels. Bortezomib treatment increased
green fluorescence ~12-fold compared to untreated cells
(P<0.0001) while metformin treated cells exhibited a ~4fold increase in green fluorescence compared to untreated
cells (P<0.001) (Figure 3B). Bortezomib and metformin
co-treatment led to fluorescence intensity less than that
seen with bortezomib (P<0.0001) or metformin treatment
alone (P<0.02). The results suggested that metformin
suppressed GRP78 upregulation and that GRP78 was
required for bortezomib-induced autophagy.
To further investigate the role of GRP78 in
autophagy, HSPA5 was genetically inactivated in

RPMI8226 cells by shRNA-mediated knockdown and
drug effects were determined alone or in combination
(Figure 3C). Bortezomib increased GRP78 in cells
transfected with control shRNA but not in cells transfected
with HSPA5 shRNA. Bortezomib treatment alone, or
combined with metformin, promoted aggresome formation
in both control cells and cells with HSPA5 inactivated.
A punctate pattern of green fluorescent cytoplasmic
structures, characteristic of autophagosomes, was seen

and represented the accumulated autophagosomes.
Similar to the metformin effect, genetic inactivation of
HSPA5 impaired bortezomib-induced autophagosome
formation (Figure 3C, D). Bortezomib increased green
fluorescence in control transfected cells by ~12-fold
compared to untreated cells. Bortezomib treatment of
cells transfected with HSPA5 shRNA did not increase
green fluorescence (Figure 3D). GRP78 co-localized with
both aggresomes and autophagosomes (Figure 3E, F).

The effects of bortezomib and metformin on aggresome
and autophagosome formation were also observed using
myeloma patient CD138+ cells that had been purified from
patient bone marrow biopsies (Figure 3G).
We reasoned that bortezomib promoted formation
of aggresomes that were delivered in a GRP78dependent manner to autophagosomes. Myeloma cells
were transfected with plasmids that expressed either
wildtype (WT) GRP78 or a defective version with the
substrate binding domain mutated. The KDEL receptor
is an ER quality control protein that binds chaperone
proteins containing the KDEL motif, e.g., GRP78,

calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase, to mediate
their ER retrieval from post-ER compartments, e.g., the
Golgi complex, back to the ER. Cells transfected with
plasmids expressing GRP78-WT or the GRP78 mutant
readily formed aggresomes after bortezomib treatment
as well as after metformin or bortezomib and metformin
co-treatment (Figure 4A). However, after bortezomib
treatment, cells transfected with the GRP78 mutant
did not form autophagosomes as readily as did cells
transfected with GRP78-WT (Figure 4B). To identify
aggresome and autophagosome proteins that interacted
with GRP78, myeloma cells transfected with c-myc-

tagged GRP78-WT or GRP78 mutant were treated with
bortezomib, lysates prepared, immunoprecipitated with a
myc-specific antibody and probed by western blot. Blots
indicated that GRP78-WT, but not the GRP78 mutant,
associated with the KDEL receptor and LC3B as well
as the aggresome components HDAC6 and p62 (Figure
4C). Cells transfected with shRNA to knockdown HSPA5
were more sensitive to bortezomib than controls and cells
that expressed the GRP78 mutant were more sensitive to
bortezomib than control-transfected cells (Figure 4D, E).
Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic agent that
decreases insulin resistance and lowers blood glucose
levels through inhibition of liver glucose production
and an increase in glucose uptake in muscles [36-39].
Metformin has also been shown to reduce the viability of
numerous cancer cell lines and to inhibit the progression
and relapse of breast, prostate and lung cancer mouse
xenografts, when combined with suboptimal doses of

standard chemotherapeutic agents [40-43]. Diabetic
patients treated with metformin have a reduced incidence
of cancer and cancer-related mortality [44-46]. Since
metformin suppressed stress-induced elevation of
GRP78, we determined the metformin effect on the
anti-proliferative effect of bortezomib. Metformin or
phenformin treatment reduced myeloma proliferation and
co-treatment with bortezomib synergistically increased
the anti-proliferative effect of the proteasome inhibitor
(Figure 5A). The anti-proliferative effects of metformin
and phenformin were also observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) that expressed either AMPK WT or
AMPK DKO (Figure 5B). Functional inactivation of
AMPK did not eliminate the metformin effect on myeloma
cells to suggest that the effects were mediated, at least in
part, through AMPK-independent processes. Our results
are consistent with a number of prior studies that indicate
that metformin induces cellular stress and apoptosis

through AMPK-independent pathways [47-49]. However,
we cannot exclude that low, residual AMPK activity is
sufficient to mediate the effect of metformin under certain
conditions or that alternate pathways are activated upon
metabolic stress in cells that lack functional AMPK. The
inhibitory effect on myeloma proliferation appears to be
not only AMPK-independent, but must be independent of
metformin’s insulin-sensitizing and anti-hyperglycemic
effects since they were observed in cell-based assays.
Bortezomib triggered apoptosis is mediated
through activation of poly (ADP) ribosome polymerase,
caspase-3 and caspase-8 [50]. Myeloma cells were
transfected with shRNA to knockdown HSPA5, treated
with bortezomib and the effect on cleavage of PARP and
caspase determined by western blot (Figure 6A, B). PARP
and caspases-3 and -8 were more readily cleaved in cells
that lacked HSPA5 compared to control-transfected cells.
In addition, caspase-10 has been reported to modulate the
autophagic response. Consequently, preventing caspase-10
cleavage promotes myeloma cell survival [51]. Following
bortezomib treatment, caspase-10 was also more readily
cleaved in cells that lacked HSPA5 than in control-

transfected cells.

DISCUSSION
The ER molecular chaperone GRP78 associates
with and promotes the delivery of bortezomib-induced
aggresomes to autophagosomes to promote their efficient
disposal. Pharmacologic or genetic suppression of
GRP78 followed by proteasome inhibition significantly
impaired autophagosome formation. The ER is a putative
membrane source for generation of autophagic vacuole
membranes and is massively expanded and disorganized
in cells where GRP78 is suppressed [52]. Upon ER stress,
unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and are cleared
by the proteasome-involved ER-associated degradation
system. We hypothesized that GRP78-mediated autophagy
served as an alternative protein clearance mechanism
that circumvented inhibition of the UPS to promote
drug resistance in tumor cells. The findings provide a
new mechanism for the protective function of GRP78 in
stressed cells to promote drug resistance to suggest that
GRP78 is required for bortezomib-induced autophagy.

GRP78 represents an actionable, “druggable”, anti-cancer
target to overcome drug resistance.
The orally-administered, well-tolerated and
inexpensive anti-diabetic agent metformin displayed
anti-myeloma effects and enhanced the anti-proliferative
of bortezomib. Metformin is first-line therapy used
worldwide by millions of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.
Epidemiological studies have reported that a subset
of T2D patients treated with metformin had a lower
cancer risk and reduced cancer-related mortality rates
compared to those treated with other agents [53,54].
Furthermore, metformin has demonstrable antitumor
activity in xenografts, carcinogen-induced and geneticallyengineered mouse models to support pharmacologic
repositioning for anti-cancer therapy. The results suggest
that bortezomib co-treatment with metformin offers a
therapeutic advantage for myeloma patients over the use
of either agent alone.
Consistent with prior studies in other model
systems, we found that the anti-tumor effect of phenformin
was significantly greater than that of metformin. The
IC50 values for metformin determined here were in
the millimolar range, much greater than that observed
for phenformin and much higher than the maximallyachievable level following oral administration in humans
[55]. However, the risk/benefit ratio clearly favors
metformin over phenformin for treatment of T2D.
Historically, the daily administration of phenformin was
associated with an elevated incidence of lactic acidosis
and was linked to fatal outcomes leading to removal
from US markets. Currently there are >60 clinical studies
evaluating the anticancer effects of metformin or the
preventive effects in patients at high cancer risk. Future
studies will clinically evaluate bortezomib combined with
metformin in myeloma patients.
We hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition
of autophagy could be achieved using metabolic stressinducing agents to enhance the anti-myeloma effect of
bortezomib. Functional inactivation of AMPK genetic
ablation did not eliminate the effect of metformin to
suggest that the metformin effects are mediated, at least in
part, through AMPK-independent processes. Our results
are consistent with prior studies to indicate that metformin
induces cellular stress and apoptosis through AMPKindependent pathways. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that low, residual AMPK activity is sufficient to
mediate the effects of metformin under certain conditions
or that alternate pathways are activated upon metabolic
stress in cells that lack functional AMPK. The inhibitory
effect of metformin on myeloma proliferation appears to
be not only AMPK-independent, but must be independent
of metformin’s insulin-sensitizing and anti-hyperglycemic
effects since these effects were observed in cell-based
assays.
The findings reported here should be interpreted in
the context of the available data about the protective effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of GRP78 on cancer cells to promote a chemoresistant
phenotype and metastasis that has been associated with
poor clinical outcomes [56-58]. Specifically, GRP78
is overexpressed in response to ER-stress induced
cancer treatments and intracellular GRP78 accounts for
90% of the total cellular content and its upregulation
causes re-localization of GRP78 to cell membrane
[59]. Transmembrane GRP78 acts through the PI3K/
AKT pathway to promote cell survival and metastasis
and the humanized antibody against GRP78, MAb159,
is promising to enter in early therapeutic trials [60].
However, our study suggests that pharmacologic
suppression of GRP78 may also suppress GRP78 induction
and transmembrane localization. The crucial role of
energy metabolism in cell growth and proliferation implies
that antidiabetic or metabolism-altering drugs may hold
preventive and therapeutic value in cancer54. Because
of its exceptionally low toxicity profile, FDA approval
and early signs of efficacy, metformin is currently at the
forefront of this drug class. Clinical trials with metformin
in non-diabetic patients are needed to illuminate the
potential use of this drug in MM. Pharmacologic
repositioning of FDA-approved agents may reduce the
risk of failure in the drug discovery process as well as the
costs associated with de novo drug development [61]. In
summary, the therapeutic promise of metabolic enhancers
in the non-diabetic setting or other emerging forms of
therapy that target protein degradation pathways may
enhance the cytotoxic efficacy of bortezomib [62, 63].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
MM cell lines (MMCLs) were from the National
Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD and cultured as
described16-18. BM aspirates were obtained from patients
after approval by the UC Cancer Institute Institutional
Review Board. Malignant PCs were purified by positive
CD138 microbead selection (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego,
CA). Bortezomib was from ActiveBiochem (Maplewood,
NJ), metformin (1,1–dimethyl biguanide hydrochloride),
phenformin: N-(2-Phenylethyl) imidodicarbonimidic
diamide monohydrochloride, phenethyl-biguanide) and
reagent grade chemicals from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO). Plasmids pCMV-GRP78-myc-WT or pCMVGRP78-myc-P495L were from Addgene (Cambridge,
MA).

antibody (Abcam) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Cells were washed, incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa
fluor647 (Invitrogen), washed and applied with DAPI
fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech Birmingham, AL) to
slides and visualized using a Zeiss LSM170 confocal
microscope with settings for DAPI (EX 405nm, EM 410480nm) and red fluorescent protein (EX 633nm, EM 650700nm).

Gene Expression Microarray
Total RNA was isolated from MMCLs using the
miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc., Germantown, MD). Samples
were hybridized to the Genechip primeview human gene
expression array and those demonstrating a cutoff greater
or less than 2-fold difference from normal PC were used
for further analysis. RNA quality was confirmed using
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. For each sample, the 3’ in
vitro translation express kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
synthesized biotin-labeled RNA target from 100ng of total
RNA.

Aggresome detection
The proteostat aggresome detection kit (Enzo
Life Science, Farmingdale, NY) was used to visualize
aggresomes by confocal microscopy. MM cells were
plated, treated with bortezomib and metformin at the
indicated concentrations under standard conditions,
collected, centrifuged, washed, supernatant discarded
and the pellet fixed, washed, permeabilized, washed
again then incubated in 100μL of dual detection reagent
for 30 minutes in the dark. Excess detection reagent was
removed and the sample suspended in 100μl assay buffer,
applied to a microscope slide and analyzed using a Zeiss
LSM170 confocal microscope with the settings for DAPI
(EX 405nm, EM 410-480nm) and Texas Red (EX 560nm,
EM 600-650)

Gene knockdown
shRNA in the pLKO.1-TCR cloning vector
were from the Lenti-shRNA Library Core (Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH).
Lentiviral vectors were transfected into 293T cells
with packaging (4ug) and envelope vectors (4ug) using
Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). Virus was concentrated
by ultra-centrifugation and resuspended in PBS at ~1×109
infectious units/mL to transduce myeloma cells then
grown under puromycin (0.5ug/mL) selection for >2
weeks.

Autophagosome detection

Western blotting

The cyto-ID autophagy detection kit (Enzo Life
Science) was used to visualize autophagosomes by
confocal microscopy. MM cells were plated, treated with
bortezomib and metformin at the indicated concentrations
under standard conditions, collected, reagent and Hoechst
stain for 30 minutes in the dark. Excess detection reagent
was removed and the sample suspended in 100μl assay
buffer. The cell suspension was applied to a glass
microscope slide and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM170
confocal microscope with the settings for DAPI (EX
405nm, EM 410-480nm) and FITC (EX 488nm, EM 500550nm)

Cells were pelleted, resuspended in RIPA buffer
(Sigma) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and
phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), centrifuged, protein concentration
determined, sample buffer added, boiled and loaded onto
gels (Wako Chemical, Richmond, VA). Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with primary
antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4oC. Bands were visualized
using LI-COR (Littleton, CO) IRDye anti-mouse IgG
or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in the Odyssey
detection system. Antibodies to GRP78, HDAC6 and
KDEL receptor were from Abcam, LC3B and p62 from
Cell Signaling Technology and Alexa Fluor647 from
Invitrogen.

Quantitation of fluorescence
Fluorescent IHC images were collected by using a
Zeiss LSM710 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope with
a 63x/1.2 objective lens. Fluorescence was quantified
using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

GRP78 detection
Myeloma cells were treated under standard growth
conditions, pelleted, washed with PBS containing 0.1%
BSA, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
by PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBST), 3 mM
EDTA, pH 8. Cells were washed twice, blocked with
1% BSA in PBST for 30min at room temperature and
incubated with a GRP78-specific rabbit polyclonal
