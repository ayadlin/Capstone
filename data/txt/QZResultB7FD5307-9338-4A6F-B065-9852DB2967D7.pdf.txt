ABSTRACT
Human tumors exhibit increased glucose uptake and metabolism as a result of
high demand for ATP and anabolic substrates and this metabolotype is a negative
prognostic indicator for survival. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer
cells from several tissue origins and genetic backgrounds require the expression of
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), a regulatory
enzyme that synthesizes an allosteric activator of glycolysis, fructose-2,6bisphosphate. We report the discovery of a first-in-class PFKFB4 inhibitor, 5-(n-(8methoxy-4-quinolyl)amino)pentyl nitrate (5MPN), using structure-based virtual
computational screening. We find that 5MPN is a selective inhibitor of PFKFB4 that
suppresses the glycolysis and proliferation of multiple human cancer cell lines
but not non-transformed epithelial cells in vitro. Importantly, 5MPN has high oral
bioavailability and per os administration of a non-toxic dose of 5MPN suppresses the
glucose metabolism and growth of tumors in mice.

INTRODUCTION

testes [7-9] suggesting a unique regulatory function in
sperm metabolism. However, PFKFB4 was subsequently
observed to be expressed in multiple organs and to be
over-expressed in human tumors indicating a potential role
in cancer development and/or progression [10-13].
The functional requirement of the PFKFB4 family
member for neoplastic metabolism and growth then was
reported in 2010 when researchers demonstrated that
selective inhibition of PFKFB4 with siRNA suppressed
the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts
in athymic mice (U.S. patent publication #8,283,332).
In 2012, two independent groups reported the results of
unbiased screens for genes essential for cancer survival;
they found that PFKFB4 expression was essential for
the survival of glioma stem-like cells [14] and prostate
cancer cells [15] but not for normal cell survival. Taken
together, these recent studies suggested that PFKFB4 may
be a useful molecular target for the development of antineoplastic agents.
PFKFB4 is a bifunctional enzyme that can increase

The first committed step of glycolysis,
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), functions as a
metabolic sensor that dictates flux throughout the entire
pathway. PFK-1 senses metabolic satiety by being tightly
regulated by several products - whereas ATP, H+ ions
and citrate each inhibit PFK-1, AMP stimulates PFK1 [1-3]. In 1980, a regulatory shunt product, fructose
2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), was discovered by Emile
Van Schaftingen and Henri-Géry Hers to override ATP’s
inhibitory effects and stimulate PFK-1 in hepatocytes
[4, 5]. The steady-state concentration of F2,6BP then
was found to be dictated by a family of four bifunctional
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases
(PFKFB1-4) that have distinct tissue distributions and
kinase:bisphosphatase ratios [6]. For example, whereas
the PFKFB1 family member was found to be expressed
in hepatocytes and to regulate whole body glucose
homeostasis, PFKFB4 was initially detected in the

intracellular F2,6BP and, thus, flux through PFK-1 or
decrease F2,6BP and PFK-1 activity resulting in increased
shunting of glucose 6-phosphate for NADPH and ribose
production. Although the relative requirement of the
kinase versus the bisphosphatase domain for cancer cell
survival has been somewhat controversial [14-16], recent
studies have demonstrated that: (i) recombinant human
PFKFB4 kinase activity is 4.3-fold greater than its
phosphatase activity; (ii) both PFKFB4-specific siRNA
and genomic deletion of Pfkfb4 result in a decrease in the
steady-state concentration of intracellular F2,6BP (the
product of the kinase domain); and (iii) over-expression
of PFKFB4 increases F2,6BP in vitro [16]. Furthermore,
selective inhibition of PFKFB4 expression in lung
cancer xenografts causes a marked reduction in F2,6BP
(rather than an increase) as well as a reduction in glucose
uptake and ATP [16]. Taken together, these studies show
that, in the majority of cancer cells, the kinase domain
of PFKFB4 dominates to synthesize F2,6BP driving
glycolytic flux into the 3-carbon portion of the pathway
and enabling both ATP and anabolic substrate production.
This is in sharp contrast to a potential neoplastic role for
the bisphosphatase domain in suppressing F2,6BP levels
and increasing flux through the oxidative pentose shunt in
order to augment NADPH availability.
Based on these studies, we anticipated that
pharmacological disruption of the kinase domain of
PFKFB4 may decrease the glucose metabolism and
growth of human cancers. We now describe the in silico
discovery of a first-in-class PFKFB4 inhibitor, 5MPN,
that reduces the steady-state concentration of F2,6BP and
causes reduced glycolysis and cell cycle arrest at the G1
phase in transformed cells. 5MPN has exceptional oral
bioavailability, suppresses the glucose uptake and growth
of lung tumors and thus serves as an ideal lead compound
for the development of test agents for phase I trials.

nitrate (termed 5MPN; Figure 1A and 1B), significantly
inhibited PFKFB4 activity (Figure 1C). Based on
Lineweaver-Burk analyses, this compound appears to be
a competitive inhibitor of the F6P binding site (Figure
1D) and the Ki for 5MPN inhibition is 8.6±1.9 µmol/L.
Importantly, this compound did not inhibit PFK-1 or
PFKFB3 (Figure 1E) which share the identical substrate
and are co-expressed with PFKFB4 in multiple cell lines
and required for glucose metabolism (no inhibition of
kinase activity with 10 µM). Additionally, a panel of 97
protein kinases was not inhibited by 10 µM of 5MPN
providing further support for the selectivity of this
compound for PFKFB4 (KINOMEscan, data not shown).

Pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB4 by 5MPN
is selectively cytostatic to transformed cells
H460 cells are lung adenocarcinoma cells that harbor
several common oncogenic mutations (CDKN2Adel457,
KRASQ61H, PIK3CAE545K, STK11Q37X) and are sensitive to
inhibition of PFKFB4 using siRNA molecules [16]. We
first exposed H460 cells to increasing concentrations of
5MPN and found that 5MPN led to a dose-dependent
decrease in the intracellular F2,6BP concentration in these
cells ([F2,6BP], pmol/mg protein at 24 hours: DMSO 6.1
±0.2, 5µM 5MPN 2.3 ±0.05, 10µM 5MPN 1.52 ±0.2,
20 µM 5MPN 0.75±0.09, 30 µM 5MPN 0.43 ±0.1).
We then examined the anti-metabolic effects of 5MPN
on H460 cells over 72 hours and found that this agent
first reduced the intracellular concentration of F2,6BP,
glycolysis and ATP (Figure 2A) which in turn resulted
in a reduction in cell proliferation (Figure 2B). We also
examined the effect of 5MPN on the proliferation of nonsmall cell lung cancer (H460, H1299, H441, H522 and
A549), breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231), prostatic
adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) and colon adenocarcinoma
(HCT116) cell lines and observed a dose-dependent
reduction in growth over 48 hours (Figure 2C). Given
that PFKFB4 has been found to be expressed by normal
lung epithelia [16], we next examined the relative effects
of 5MPN on normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE)
cells versus NHBE cells that had been sequentially
immortalized with telomerase and large T antigen and
transformed with H-RasV12 (hT/LT/Ras cells). We found
that the NHBE cells were virtually unaffected whereas
hT/LT/Ras cell growth was suppressed similar to other
transformed cells (Figure 2D) which we postulate may be
due to the lower F2,6BP concentration in hT/LT/Ras cells
relative to NHBE cells [18] in addition to an increased
requirement for glycolytic flux at PFK-1. In order to
interrogate the requirement of PFKFB4 inhibition for the
observed suppression of proliferation (on-target effects),
we next examined the effects of genetic modulation of
PFKFB4 on the anti-proliferative effects of 5MPN. We

Discovery of a first-In-class small molecule
antagonist of PFKFB4
We utilized the X-ray structure of the Rattus
norvegicus testes PFKFB4 [17] to conduct an in silico
screen of small molecules to identify potential compounds
that may interact with the fructose 6-phosphate (F6P)
binding domain of PFKFB4. Over one hundred
compounds were identified, scored, ranked, and analyzed
based on their association potential with the active site
within PFKFB4. We physically tested the 30 best-score
compounds for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity
of recombinant PFKFB4. Only one of the screened

PFKFB4 inhibition with 5MPN causes a G1 cell
cycle arrest that is reversed by PFKFB4 overexpression

found that whereas over-expression of PFKFB4 protected
H460 cells from 5MPN, genomic deletion of Pfkfb4
sensitized cells to 5MPN (Figure 2E, 2F), thus supporting
the concept that inhibition of PFKFB4 by 5MPN is
causing the observed reduction in H460 cell proliferation.
Taken together, these data indicate that 5MPN is a potent
inhibitor of PFKFB4 that selectively suppresses the
proliferation of transformed cells.

We noted a marked reduction in viable H460 cells
after exposure to 5MPN for 48 hours (see Figure 2B) and
postulated that 5MPN was inducing apoptosis, arresting
cell cycle progression, or both. Whereas we observed only
a minimal increase in apoptotic cells after 5MPN exposure

or selective PFKFB4 siRNA transfection (Figure 3A,
3B), we observed a marked G1 arrest with both 5MPN
and PFKFB4 siRNA (Figure 3C, 3D). We then overexpressed PFKFB4 and exposed the H460 cells to 5MPN
at the indicated concentrations and assessed the effects on
cell cycle and F2,6BP. We found that over-expression of
PFKFB4 reversed the reduction in F2,6BP (Figure 3E)
and G1 arrest (Figure 3F) caused by 5MPN. These studies
suggest that 5MPN is suppressing PFKFB4 which in turn
is resulting in a reduction in the G1/S transition.

1 or PFKFB3 which share the substrate-binding domain
and are also expressed in multiple cancer cell lines yet
still reduces the glycolysis and intracellular F2,6BP of
cancer cells. Furthermore, we find that the cell cycle arrest
effects of 5MPN can be overcome by over-expression of
PFKFB4 indicating that the anti-cancer effects of 5MPN
are due, at least in part, to its inhibition of PFKFB4. Since
5MPN suppresses glycolytic flux through to the enolase
reaction (Figure 2A), the availability of both fructose
6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate for ribose
synthesis via the non-oxidative pentose shunt is reduced
by 5MPN. Accordingly, we believe that the observed G1
arrest in vitro caused by 5MPN (and by PFKFB4 siRNA)
is a direct result of reduced availability of these glycolytic
intermediates that are required for DNA synthesis during
the S phase. Comprehensive metabolomic studies of the
effects of PFKFB4 inhibition by genetic approaches and
5MPN will be initiated in future studies in order to better
understand the observed G1 arrest caused by PFKFB4
inhibition.
We used molecular modeling to conduct virtual
screens for novel ligands that might bind to the kinase as
opposed to the bisphosphatase domain since the kinase
activity is essential for neoplastic glucose metabolism and
growth [16]. 5MPN is the first small molecule antagonist
of recombinant PFKFB4 kinase activity and we found
that it not only reduces F2,6BP, but also glycolytic flux
through PFK-1 and cell cycle progression into the S phase.
The observation that pharmacological inhibition of the
kinase domain of PFKFB4 suppresses cell proliferation
thus provides “proof-of-concept” that PFKFB4 kinase, as
opposed to bisphosphatase inhibitors, may have utility as
anti-cancer agents.
A related family member, PFKFB3, is encoded on
a different chromosome [6] and has a kinase:phosphatase
ratio and tissue distribution distinct from PFKFB4 [16].
A series of small molecules have been developed that
selectively inhibit PFKFB3 and an optimized derivative,
PFK-158, is currently undergoing phase I trial testing
in advanced solid tumor patients (clinicaltrials.gov
#NCT02044861). Although the relative roles of PFKFB3
and PFKFB4 are poorly understood, PFKFB4 appears
to be essential for cancer cell survival and to correlate
highly with hypoxic regions of tumors [16] whereas
PFKFB3 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus
where it activates PFK-1 and cyclin dependent kinase 1
respectively [20, 21]. We postulate that these two enzymes
may provide some degree of reciprocal compensation and
that dual inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 may yield
optimal suppression of intracellular F2,6BP and cell
viability. Accordingly, on-going efforts are directed at
understanding the relative roles of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4,
and at examining the anti-tumor effects of dual Pfkfb3 and
Pfkfb4 genomic deletion as well as combined PFK-158
and 5MPN administration.
Although there has been some degree of

5MPN has high oral bioavailability and suppresses
the glucose uptake and growth of tumors in mice
We examined the pharmacokinetics of intravenous
and oral administration of 5MPN and found that both
routes were adequate to achieve potentially therapeutic
concentrations when administered daily (Figure 4A, 4B).
Given the potential usefulness of oral administration in
terms of cost and convenience, we elected to pursue this
route in subsequent toxicity and efficacy pre-clinical
studies. Initially, we dosed C57BL/6 mice with 120 mg/kg
PO (dose chosen based on a dose escalation trial) for two
weeks and analyzed the effect on complete blood counts,
electrolytes, hepatic and renal function, body mass and
the gross and histological appearance of the brain, heart,
lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen. We found no signs of
toxicity either from these objective measures or from any
behavioral or clinical changes (i.e. ruffled fur, lethargy,
ataxia or labored respiration). Importantly, at this oral
dose, we found that 5MPN suppressed the growth of Lewis
lung carcinomas (LLC) grown in syngeneic mice (Figure
4C) and H460 human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts
grown in athymic mice (Figure 4J) without affecting body
weight (Figure 4D, 4K). We next examined the effects of
oral administration of 5MPN on intratumoral F2,6BP and
glucose uptake by LLC xenografts and observed a marked
reduction in F2,6BP (Figure 4E) and 2-[18F]-fluoro-2deoxyglucose uptake using positron emission tomography
(Figure 4F). We confirmed that 5MPN caused a G1 arrest
in LLC cells in vitro similar to H460 cells (Figure 4G)
and then examined the number of Ki67-positive cells since
Ki67 expression correlates with later S and G2 phases of
the cell cycle [19]. We found that oral administration of
5MPN caused a reduction in Ki67-positive cells in the
LLC xenografts (Figure 4H, 4I) suggesting that 5MPN
may be reducing cell cycle progression in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report the discovery of a first-inclass and highly specific small molecule antagonist of
the kinase domain of PFKFB4 that suppresses glucose
metabolism and the proliferation of multiple cancer types.

trepidation regarding the pharmacological targeting of
enzymes that regulate an essential biochemical process
such as glycolysis, we have found that PFKFB4, an
enzyme expressed in several normal organs, can be
pharmacologically inhibited without gross, histological or
laboratory signs of toxicity. Furthermore, the observation
that 5MPN was selectively cytostatic to RAS-transformed
cells and not normal cells and suppressed tumor growth
without causing toxicity is at least consistent with the
hypothesis that neoplastic cells may be metabolically
reprogrammed to rely more heavily on this regulator
of metabolism. It is noteworthy that an inhibitor of the
essential non-mutated cell cycle regulatory enzymes,
CDK4 and CDK6, palbociclib, was recently found to
double the progression-free survival of breast cancer
patients without causing excessive toxicity [22]. Based
on this recent clinical success, we predict that PFKFB4
inhibitors such as 5MPN that suppress glucose metabolism
may yield favorable therapeutic indices in patients
suffering with advanced solid cancers.

PFKFB4 modeling and compound screen
The PFKFB4 homology model used the rat testes
PFKFB4 isozyme X-ray structure (PDB code 1BIF) as
a structural template. An alignment was generated using
Clustal W [26]. Four homology models were generated
using Modeller [27], and the structure that best reproduced
the PFKFB4 binding site was selected for further use. The
residues essential to ligand binding and protein activity for
PFKFB4 were correlated to equivalent residue numbers in
the consensus structure. The catalytic site residues were
selected to produce a residue-based protomol for Surflex
1.33 [28] for the virtual screening run using the 2007
ZINC-drug-like library containing 3,381,225 compounds.
The highest-scoring 100 molecules were identified for
purchase. All computational work and virtual screening
was done in the James Graham Brown Cancer Center
Molecular Modeling Facility. The top 30 commercially
available compounds were purchased and examined
for inhibitory effects on H460 cell proliferation and
recombinant PFKFB4 activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
H460, H1299, H441, H522 and A549 non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MDA-MB-231 (breast),
LNCaP (prostatic) and HCT116 (colon) adenocarcinoma
and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell lines were obtained
from ATCC (authenticated by STR analysis) and were
used within 6 months of acquisition. PFKFB4-/- ear pinna
fibroblasts isolated from TamCre/loxP/PFKFB4-/- mice
were immortalized as described previously [16, 23].
Normal bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were obtained
from Lonza and NHBE cells expressing telomerase, SV40
large T antigen and activated Ras (hT/LT/Ras) were a
gift from Dr. B. J. Rollins, Dana Farber Cancer Institute
[24]. All cell lines were tested and found negative for
mycoplasma (PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit, ABM).
Cell lines were grown in DMEM (A549, LNCaP, MDAMB-231, LLC and PFKFB4-/-), RPMI 1640 (H460,
H1299, H441, H522) and McCoy’s 5A media (HCT116)
(all from Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum
(Hyclone). NHBE and hT/LT/Ras cells were grown in
BEGM containing SingleQuots (Lonza). All lines were
cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. In certain experiments,
4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to
PFKFB4-/- fibroblasts at indicated concentrations.

Transfections
For siRNA experiments, cells growing in
6-well plates were transfected with control (siCtrl,
Stealth Negative Control Medium GC, Invitrogen) or
PFKFB4 siRNA (siFB4, HSS107863, Invitrogen) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) and harvested as
indicated. For overexpression experiments, cells were
transfected with pCMV-XL4 (Vector, Vec, Origene)
or pCMV-XL4 containing full-length PFKFB4 (FB4,
Origene) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and
harvested as indicated.

Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein extraction and blotting were conducted
as previously described [16]. Membranes were probed
with antibodies to PFKFB4 (Abcam) or β-actin (Sigma)
followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies respectively (1:5000, Pierce).
Data shown are representative of three experiments.

In vivo studies

5MPN was assayed as previously described [8, 16, 29]. The
activity of 5MPN against 97 kinases was examined using a
commercially available active-site dependent competition
binding assay core service (KINOMEscanEDGE) that
quantifies the capacity of test agents to compete with an
immobilized, active-site directed ligand using a DNAtagged kinase and immobilized ligand and compound.

The pharmacokinetic profile was determined in
female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories)
following IV and oral administration of 5MPN. Using
only female mice lowered the animal numbers required
for meaningful results without issues of potential gender
differences in exposure. Eight time points (n=3 per time
point) were used to determine indicated PK parameters
calculated using WinNonLin v5.0. Plasma samples were
extracted using acetonitrile and analyzed by LC/MS-MS
using a PhenomexSynergi Polar-RP 4micron 50X2.0 mm
column eluted with a biphasic mobile phase (0.5% formic
acid in acetonitrile and water).
For xenograft studies, LLC or H460 cells collected
from exponential growth phase culture were washed
and resuspended in PBS. Groups of female C57BL/6
mice were injected with LLC cells (n=10 per group, s.c.,
1X106 cells) and groups of female BALB/c athymic mice
(Charles River) were injected with H460 cells (n=10 per
group, s.c, 5 X 106 cells). Tumor masses were determined
in a blinded fashion with Vernier calipers using the
formula: mass (mg) = (width, mm)2 X (length, mm)/2
as previously described [31]. When tumor masses were
150-200 mg, mice were randomized to daily DMSO or
5MPN (in 30% Captisol, 100 µl, by gavage). Tumor
measurements and body weights were followed daily. All
data are expressed as the mean ± SD of two experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).
At the end of the experiment, one hour after a single
dose of DMSO or 5MPN,animals were euthanized, tumors
removed and sections fixed in 10% formaldehyde for
immunohistochemistry or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
for analyses. Subsets of tumor-bearing mice (n=3) were
administered a single dose of either DMSO or 5MPN one
hour prior to imaging then injected i.p. with 2-[18F]-fluoro2-deoxyglucose (FDG, 150µCi, 100 µl) and, 45 min after
FDG injection, were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in
oxygen and transferred to a R-4 Rodent Scanner (CTI
Concorde Microsystems) micro-positron emission
tomograph to capture images as previously described
[16]. Regions of interest in the tumors and cerebellum
were quantified in quadruplicate and expressed as the
mean ± SD of the ratio of tumor:cerebellar FDG uptake.
Animal experiments were approved by the University of
Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

F2,6BP measurements
Cells or tissues were prepared as previously
described [16] and F2,6BP content measured using a
coupled enzyme reaction following the method of Van
Schaftingen et al [30] and normalized to total cellular
protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo
Scientific). All data are expressed as the mean ± SD of
three experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by
the two-sample t test (independent variable).

Glycolysis assay
Cells growing in 6-well plates were incubated in
500 μl of complete medium containing 1 μCi of 5-[3H]
glucose per well for 60 min in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Media
was collected, 3H2O formed via glycolysis from the 5-[3H]
glucose measured and counts normalized as previously
described [16]. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD of
three experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by
the two-sample t test (independent variable).

ATP measurements
Cells were lysed and intracellular ATP determined
as described previously [16]. All data are expressed as the
mean ± SD of three experiments. Statistical significance
was assessed by the two-sample t test (independent
variable).

Flow cytometry
To measure apoptosis, cells were stained with
annexin V and propidium iodide and examined as
previously described [16]. For cell cycle experiments, cells
were detached, washed with cold PBS and fixed in 70%
ethanol at 4°C for 30 minutes. The cells then were pelleted
by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS containing PI and
RNase A, incubated at 37°C in the dark for 30 minutes
and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur).
Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TREE STAR
Inc.). Results were calculated as the mean ± SD of three
experiments and data shown are representative of three
independent experiments.

Immunohistochemistry
Five μm mounted sections of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded LLC tumor tissues were processed
as previously described[16] and then incubated with
anti-Ki-67 primary antibody (Abcam) overnight,
followed by HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary
18009

Oncotarget

antibody (1:300, Pierce). Sections were developed
with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and
counterstained as previously described [16]. Slides were
scanned using a ScanScope XT Digital Slide Scanner
(Aperio), data analyzed with the positive pixel count
algorithm (ImageScope, Aperio) and a minimum of 5
fields (20x magnification) were quantified for each tumor
section. The data are depicted as % positive pixels/total
pixels ± SD.
