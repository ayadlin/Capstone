Abstract
To investigate the therapeutic activity of the fully human anti–
HLA-DR antibody 1D09C3 in multiple myeloma (MM), we
reevaluated HLA-DR expression on CD138+ cells, analyzed the
capacity of IFN-; to up-regulate HLA-DR expression on MM
cell lines, and tested the in vitro and in vivo activity of 1D09C3
alone or in combination with IFN-;. CD138+HLA-DR+ cells
were detected in 31 of 60 patients, with 15 of 60 patients
having z20% CD138+HLA-DR+ cells (median, 50%; range,
23–100). Because primary plasma cells cannot be efficiently
cultured in vitro, we used a panel of MM cell lines with a dim/
negative to bright HLA-DR expression to evaluate 1D09C3induced cell death. Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining
showed that 1D09C3-induced cell death correlated with
constitutive HLA-DR expression. Induction of HLA-DR by
IFN-; restored the sensitivity of HLA-DR dim cell lines to
1D09C3. In vivo, the combined IFN-;/1D09C3 treatment
significantly increased the median survival of nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice xenografted
with KMS-11 cell line, compared with controls (147 versus 48
days, P V 0.0001) or mice receiving 1D09C3 alone (147 versus
92 days, P V 0.03). The better therapeutic activity of IFN-;/
1D09C3 treatment over 1D09C3 alone was further shown by a
2-fold increase of mice being disease-free at 150 days after
xenograft (47% versus 25%). No mice experienced any
apparent treatment-related toxicity. Our data show that (a)
one fourth of MM patients express HLA-DR on CD138+ cells
and (b) IFN-;–induced up-regulation of HLA-DR results in a
potent enhancement of the in vivo antimyeloma activity of
1D09C3. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3269–75]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasia of plasma cells
hallmarked by tumor cell tropism for the bone marrow and
production of monoclonal immunoglobulin detectable in serum
and/or urine. The median overall survival for MM patients is 4 to 5
years, ranging from <6 months to >10 years according to distinct
prognostic factors (1). Although high-dose melphalan followed by
autologous stem cell transplantation represented a significant

progress in the treatment of MM and is now considered standard
therapy for younger patients, the disease remains incurable in the
majority of cases (2, 3).
New agents, such as the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide
and lenalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, have
shown a significant role in patients with relapsed and/or refractory
disease as well as in the upfront setting (4–10). Despite these
important therapeutic advances, in which survival advantage has
been shown compared with standard therapy (6, 10, 11), disease
relapse still occurs, and thus new strategies to improve disease
control are required (3, 12). Treatments targeting both tumor cells
and microenvironment have been highly successful but strategies
further targeting tumor cells directly and enhancing host immunity
against tumor are key next steps in the continued efforts to combat
this disease (12).
The development and approval of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
targeting tumor-specific antigens represents a major advance in
the therapy of a variety of neoplastic diseases (13), including non–
Hodgkin’s lymphomas (14–18) and breast cancer (19, 20). Although
the phenotype of MM cells is an important component of tumor
heterogeneity and might represent a specific target for new
treatments, mAbs targeting malignant myeloma cells have not
yet been included as part of myeloma therapy (21–24).
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR is one of the three
highly polymorphic genes of the class II MHC, which, under normal
conditions, are selectively expressed on immune cells, including B
lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic
cells (25). Preclinical evidences suggest that both B-cell tumors
(26, 27) and T-cell tumors (28) can be killed in vitro and in vivo by
signals delivered through receptors involved in cell activation and
growth, such as HLA-DR (29–31). Constitutive HLA-DR expression
on normal B cells is down-regulated during differentiation toward
plasma cells (32) due to silencing of class II transactivator (33),
which is also involved in suppressing HLA-DR expression on
malignant plasma cells (34). Expression of both class II transactivator and HLA-DR in myeloma cells can be up-regulated by
IFN-g, thus representing an interesting area of investigation for
specifically targeting malignant plasma cells (35–37).
Recently, an anti–HLA-DR antibody termed 1D09C3 has been
generated by screening the human combinatorial antibody library
(38). In vitro, 1D09C3 exerts a potent tumoricidal activity on several
lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, as well as primary cells from
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (38, 39). Cell death
induced by 1D09C3 involves a cascade of events, including reactive
oxygen species increase, c-Jun-NH2-kinase activation, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization (39). In vivo, injection of

1D09C3 in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD/SCID) mice xenografted with a variety of human malignant
lymphoma cell lines results in significant delay of tumor growth
and long-term disease-free survival in significant proportions of
lymphoma-bearing mice (38, 39). 1D09C3 is currently being tested
in two phase I clinical trials in patients with relapsed and refractory
B-cell malignancies, including non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma, CLL, and
Hodgkin lymphoma.
To evaluate in a preclinical setting the therapeutic potential of
1D09C3 in MM patients, we analyzed HLA-DR expression on bone
marrow malignant plasma cells enriched from 60 consecutive MM
patients, investigated the capacity of IFN-g to up-regulate HLA-DR
expression on myeloma cell lines, and tested the activity of 1D09C3
alone or in combination with IFN-g in inducing cell death both
in vitro and in vivo using a xenotransplant model of MM in NOD/
SCID mice.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Recombinant human IFN-g (Imukin) was purchased from
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Ingelheim, Germany); 1D09C3 was kindly
provided by GPC Biotech (Munich, Germany); and the human IgG4 isotype
control (I-4764) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).
Patients. Between March 2003 and May 2006, 60 consecutive patients
with a diagnosis of MM (n = 58) or monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (n = 2) were studied. Patients ( females 29, males
31) ranged in age from 28 to 80 years (median, 59 years). The majority of
patients (64%) had a stage IIIA or IIIB MM. Mean serum level of h2microglobulin was 3.9 mg/L (median, 2.8; range, 0.7–20). Cytogenetic
abnormalities were detected in 29 of 58 analyzed patients, with 12 patients
showing a 13q14 deletion, 13 patients a chromosome 13 monosomy, and
4 patients a t(11;14) translocation, whereas in 29 cases no karyotype
abnormality could be detected. At the time of analysis, 46 patients were
newly diagnosed, 2 were relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation,
1 was relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation, 8 had been treated
with regimens including high-dose dexamethasone [dexamethasone (n = 5);
dexamethasone and thalidomide (n = 3)], and 3 had been treated with
melphalan and prednisone. The study was approved by institutional ethical
committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Highly purified plasma cells and cell lines. CD138+ plasma cells were
enriched using an immunomagnetic method according to manufacturer’s
instructions and the AutoMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach,
Germany). Enrichment of CD138+ cells resulted in a median purity of 91%
(range, 27–100%) and a median recovery of 55% (range, 27–95%). Cell lines
included KMS-11, RPMI 8226, OPM-2, U-266, LP-1, and ARH-77, and were
purchased from the DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany).
Flow cytometry. The following mAbs were used: anti–CD138-FITC
(clone B-B4) from Serotec (Kidlington, Oxford, United Kingdom), anti–
CD45-peridinin chlorophyll protein (clone 2D1), and anti–HLA-DR-phycoerythrin (clone L243), all from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Highly
purified CD138+ cells were analyzed for HLA-DR expression by three-color
flow cytometry (CD138/HLA-DR/CD45) using a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a Macintosh PowerMac G4
personal computer (Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA) and Cell Quest
(Becton Dickinson) software. Briefly, CD138-enriched cells (0.5  106) were
incubated with the appropriate antibody combination or isotype controls.
The expression of HLA-DR on CD138+ cells was measured as percentage of
positive cells according to gates set using the isotype control staining. Bone
marrow samples were defined positive for HLA-DR when z20% CD138+
cells were HLA-DR+. The intensity of HLA-DR expression on CD138+ plasma
cells was measured in terms of mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFI-R),
which was calculated as MFI of anti–HLA-DR stained samples/MFI of
isotype control stained samples.
Viable cell countings. MM cell lines (0.5  105/mL to 1  105/mL)
resuspended in culture medium supplemented with heat-inactivated serum

were exposed to IFN-g (96 h, 100 IU/mL), 1D09C3 (24 h, 2.5 Ag/mL), or IFNg plus 1D09C3. Controls were untreated or were exposed to the murine
anti–HLA-DR 10F12 antibody that fails to induce cell death (40). At the end
of incubation, viable and dead cells were distinguished by PI staining and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. To obtain absolute cell
counts by FACS, cell samples were supplemented with Flowcount beads.
Cell counts were calculated by the following equation: viable cells  total
beads/counted beads.
Annexin V/PI staining. The Annexin V-FITC assay (Bender MedSystems, San Bruno, CA) was used to quantitatively determine the percentage
of cells undergoing apoptosis after exposure to IFN-g and/or 1D09C3 (41,
42). Controls were either without antibody or with the murine anti–HLADR 10F12 antibody (40). Briefly, cells to be analyzed were washed twice with
cold PBS and then resuspended in binding buffer [10 nmol/L HEPES, 140
nmol/L NaCl, 5 nmol/L CaCl2 (pH 7.4)]. Following incubation, 0.1 mL of the
cell suspension was transferred to a 5 mL culture tube, and 5 AL of Annexin
V-FITC were added. After vortexing, samples were incubated for 10 min at
room temperature in the dark. At the end of the incubation, 0.2 mL of
binding buffer and 10 AL of PI were added, and the cells were analyzed
immediately by flow cytometry. The Annexin V/PI double staining allowed
to distinguish between apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI ) and nonapoptotic [i.e.,
dead cells (Annexin V+/PI+ plus Annexin V /PI+)].
In vivo tumoricidal activity in NOD/SCID mice. Six- to eight-week-old
female NOD/SCID mice with body weight of 20 to 25 g were purchased from
Charles River (Milan, Italy). Mice were housed under standard laboratory
conditions according to our institutional guidelines. Animal experiments
were done according to the Italian laws (D.L. 116/92 and following
additions), which enforce the EU 86/109 Directive and were approved by the
institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation. On day 0, mice
were given cyclophosphamide i.p. (50 mg/kg), and on day 1 were inoculated
with KMS-11 cells i.v. (0.5  106 per mouse). Mice were checked twice
weekly for body weight measurements and toxicity. End point of in vivo
experiments was death. Treatment groups included mice receiving IFN-g
(104 IU/mouse; i.p.; days 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9), 1D09C3 (1 or 2 mg/mouse; s.c.;
days 3, 7, 9), or IFN-g plus 1D09C3 (1 mg/mouse; s.c.; days 3, 7, and 9).
Control mice received PBS or the human IgG4 isotype control (1 mg/mouse;
s.c.; days 3, 7, and 9) as an irrelevant antibody control. Experiments were
done on four separate occasions, using five mice per treatment group.
Histologic analysis and immunohistochemistry. Mice bearing s.c.
tumor nodules (f10 mm in diameter) of KMS-11 cells (5  106 per mouse)
were treated with IFN-g and after 48 h tumors were excised and analyzed.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor nodules were dewaxed, hydrated,
sectioned at 3 Am, and stained with H&E or processed for immunohistochemistry by using a mouse anti–human HLA-DR mAb (clone LN3, Alexis
Corporation, Lausen, Switzerland). Immunostaining was done using an

CD138+HLA-DR+ cells (n = 31), HLA-DR expression is also shown according to
CD45 expression. Black lines, median values. Dotted line, 20% cutoff level.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done with the statistical
package Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) run on a Macintosh
G4 personal computer (Apple Computer). To determine whether there was
a nonrandom association between two categorical variables, Fisher’s exact
test was used. To test the probability of significant differences between
untreated and treated samples, the Student’s t test for paired data (two-tail)
was used. Survival curves were created using the product limit method of
Kaplan-Meier, and survival differences were compared using the log-rank
test. Differences were considered significant if P V 0.05.

Results
HLA-DR expression on primary CD138+ cells. Analysis of
HLA-DR expression on CD138+ cells from 60 bone marrow samples
revealed a wide degree of heterogeneity in terms of fluorescence
intensity [median MFI-R of 4.3 (mean, 21); range, 2.4–89] as well as
percentages of CD138+HLA-DR+ cells. Overall, CD138+HLA-DR+
cells were detected in 31 of 60 patients (52%; Fig. 1), with the
median percentage of CD138+HLA-DR+ cells being 3% (mean, 17%;
range, 0–100%; Table 1). Fifteen of 60 patients (25%) had z20%
CD138+HLA-DR+ plasma cells, with three patients (5%) expressing
HLA-DR on 100% of their tumor cells (Fig. 1). In HLA-DR+ patients
(i.e., those with z20% CD138+HLA-DR+ marrow plasma cells), the
median percentage of CD138+HLA-DR+ plasma cells was 50%
(mean, 54%; range, 23–100; Table 1). HLA-DR expression on CD138+

cells was not associated with adverse prognostic factors, including
disease stage, 13q14 deletion or chromosome 13 monosomy, or
serum levels of h2-microglobulin. Because CD45+ plasma cells are
likely to be important in the pathogenesis and progression of
MM, HLA-DR expression was analyzed on CD138+CD45+ and
CD138+CD45 plasma cells. The median percentage of CD138+
plasma cells that expressed CD45 was 6% (mean, 35%; range,
0–100). Overall, the median percentages of CD138+HLA-DR+
expressing or lacking CD45 were 29% and 14%, respectively (Table
1). Among HLA-DR+ patients, 10 (67%) and 5 (33%) of 15 patients
were CD138+CD45+HLA-DR+ and CD138+CD45 HLA-DR+, respectively (Fig. 1).
HLA-DR expression on MM cell lines. Due to the inherent
difficulties in culturing primary plasma cells, a panel of MM cell
lines with heterogeneous HLA-DR expression was selected to
investigate whether constitutive as well as IFN-g–induced HLA-DR
could be targeted by 1D09C3. As shown in Fig. 2A, LP-1, ARH-77,
and U-266 were 100% HLA-DR positive with a bright HLA-DR
expression, as shown by MFI-Rs of 63, 110, and 315, respectively
(Fig. 2B). Constitutive HLA-DR expression detected in these cell
lines was further increased upon culture with IFN-g. In contrast,
OPM-2, RPMI 8226, and KMS-11 showed 0%, 7%, and 55% HLA-DR+
cells, respectively, with negative or dim antigen expression (Fig. 2B).
Upon exposure to IFN-g, RPMI 8226 and KMS-11, but not OPM-2
cell lines, showed a statistically significant increase of HLA-DR

expression both in terms of percentage of positive cells and
intensity of antigen expression (Fig. 2A–B).
In vitro antiproliferative activity of 1D09C3 and/or IFN-g.
The effect of 1D09C3 on the in vitro growth of untreated as well as
IFN-g–treated cell lines was then investigated. Treatment of RPMI
8226 and OPM-2 with 1D09C3 alone failed to affect both viable cell
countings and cell death, and resulted in an average 25% reduction
of viability of KMS-11 cell line (i.e., the cell line with a dim HLA-DR
expression; Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, exposure of HLA-DR+ cell
lines to 1D09C3 significantly reduced mean viable cell countings
(100% versus 24%, P V 0.001) and increased mean cell death (20%
versus 44%, P V 0.001), compared with controls (Fig. 3C and D).
IFN-g used as single agent reduced, although at a variable degree,
viable cell countings in four of six cell lines (Fig. 3A–C).
As compared with controls, exposure of RPMI 8226 and KMS-11
cell lines to the combined IFN-g/1D09C3 treatment significantly
reduced viable cell countings to 50% (P V 0.0001) and 29% (P V
0.0001), respectively, and increased cell death to 45% (P V 0.0001)
and 40% (P V 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 3A–B). In contrast, the
combined treatment was ineffective on OPM-2 cell line, which
failed to show any HLA-DR induction upon pretreatment with
IFN-g, as well as three of three HLA-DR+ cell lines (Fig. 3).
In vivo tumoricidal activity. To determine whether the
combined IFN-g/1D09C3 treatment could enhance the antimye-

loma activity not only in vitro but also in vivo, a xenograft model of
MM was used. KMS-11 cell line was selected for in vivo studies due
to its HLA-DR expression, which mimics antigen expression usually
detected on primary CD138+ plasma cells. KMS-11 xenograft is
characterized by a progressive bone marrow infiltration detectable
by day 14 after tumor inoculation when tumor cells represent on
average 25% to 30% of marrow cellularity. Skeletal lesions in the
skull as well as vertebrae and extraskeletal lesions, including
plasmacytomas in soft tissues, can be detected in >50% of
xenografted mice. The development of spinal lesions is associated
with hind-leg paralysis (95% of mice), usually occurring 5 to 6
weeks after xenografting. Additionally, a monoclonal n light chain
of human type can be detected in the serum of KMS-11–bearing
NOD/SCID mice.
Consistent with in vitro data, anti–HLA-DR immunostaining
staining of sections from tumor nodules growing in mice injected
s.c. with KMS-11 cell line revealed that treatment with IFN-g
induced a marked induction of HLA-DR expression both in terms
of percentage of positive cells as well as intensity of antigen
expression (Fig. 4A and B). Treatment with PBS or IFN-g resulted
in median survival times of 48 and 50 days, respectively (Fig. 4C).
Treatment with the human IgG4 isotype control used as an
irrelevant antibody resulted in a survival similar to that of PBStreated mice (data not shown). A significant increase of median

xenografted with KMS-11 cell line (0.5  106 cells/mouse, i.v.). Mice received PBS (black line ), IFN-g (104 IU/mouse; i.p.; days 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9; blue line ), 1D09C3
at 3 mg/mouse (green line ) or 6 mg/mouse (yellow line ; s.c.; days 3, 7, and 9), or IFN-g plus 1D09C3 (3 mg/mouse, red line ). Survival was measured from the
day of xenografting. Each treatment group contained 20 mice.

survival over controls was detected in mice treated with 1D09C3
alone at either 3 mg/mouse (48 versus 92 days, P V0.0001) or 6 mg/
mouse (48 versus 89 days, P V 0.0001). For both dose levels,
treatment with 1D09C3 alone resulted in 25% of NOD/SCID mice
alive and disease-free at the end of the 150-day observation period.
The combined treatment with IFN-g plus 1D09C3 (3 mg/mouse)
resulted in a significant increase of median survival compared with
controls (48 versus 147 days, P V 0.0001) as well as mice receiving
1D09C3 alone at 3 mg/mouse (92 versus 147, P V 0.04) or 6 mg/
mouse (89 versus 147, P V 0.03). The significant enhancement of
therapeutic activity of the combined IFN-g/1D09C3 treatment over
1D09C3 alone was further supported by an increase up to 47% of
animals being alive and well at the end of the 150-day observation
period. No mice experienced any apparent treatment-related
toxicity.

Discussion
A single autologous transplantation is now considered standard
therapy for younger MM patients (4). Tandem autotransplantation
has significantly increased both overall and event-free survival
(43, 44); however, due to age restrictions, its feasibility is limited to

www.aacrjournals.org

a small subset of young MM patients. Moreover, with the advent
of novel therapies, its effect remains controversial. Despite the
introduction of new drugs that further contributed at improving
the outcome of MM (11, 45), virtually all patients ultimately relapse,
suggesting that new treatments specifically targeting the neoplastic
clone and/or its microenvironment are required (12). The selfrenewal capacity of plasma cells in the SCID-human mouse model
suggests that these apparently terminally differentiated B cells
retain self-renewal capacity, thus critically contributing to disease
relapse (46). Additionally, the presence of somatic hypermutations
of immunoglobulin variable region genes is consistent with an
immortalizing event during plasma cell generation in germinal
centers of lymph nodes (47), suggesting that plasma cell phenotype
may indeed represent a specific target for new treatments (48).
Class II antigens represent an emerging therapeutic target in
lymphoproliferative disorders, due to the development and clinical
availability of several anti–HLA-DR mAbs, including the murine
Lym-1 (49), the humanized Hu1D10 (apolizumab; ref. 50), and the
fully human antibody named 1D09C3 (38). The latter antibody has

in vivo in NOD/SCID mice in several clinical models of either
minimal tumor burden or disseminated disease (38, 39).
In view of the availability of 1D09C3 for future phase II studies,
we reevaluated HLA-DR expression in MM to find out whether
1D09C3 might represent a treatment modality to target malignant
plasma cells. Expression of HLA-DR on plasma cells was detected
in 31 of 60 patients (52%). Fifteen of 60 patients (25%) had z20%
CD138+ plasma cells expressing the HLA-DR antigen, with three
patients (5%) expressing HLA-DR on 100% of their tumor cells.
These data suggest that targeting HLA-DR antigen would
substantially affect the neoplastic clone in at least one fourth of
MM patients. Two separate populations of plasma cells have been
reported on the basis of CD45 expression (51) and CD45+ plasma
cells are likely to be important in the pathogenesis and progression
of MM (52). Indeed, two thirds of HLA-DR+ patients express CD45
on their plasma cells, suggesting that 1D09C3 might represent an
appropriate treatment modality to target self-renewing, malignant
plasma cells. HLA-DR expression on plasma cells was not
associated with specific disease stages or distinct cytogenetic
abnormalities.
Because primary plasma cells cannot be efficiently cultured
in vitro and xenografted in vivo, we used a panel of MM cell lines
characterized by a heterogenous HLA-DR expression resembling
that detected on primary plasma cells to evaluate the potential
clinical relevance of HLA-DR targeting. In vitro, 1D09C3-induced
cell death strongly correlated with constitutive HLA-DR expression.
Because expression of both class II transactivator and HLA-DR can
be efficiently up-regulated by IFN-g at least in cell lines with a dim
HLA-DR expression, we sought to determine whether IFN-g–
induced HLA-DR expression could restore the sensitivity of
1D09C3-unresponsive cell lines to the cytotoxic activity of the
antibody. Indeed, an efficient HLA-DR induction upon culture with
IFN-g was associated with a marked triggering of 1D09C3-induced
cell death, whereas failure to induce HLA-DR expression resulted
in no sensitization to 1D09C3. Translating these results from cell
lines to primary cells would imply that IFN-g exposure could
substantially enhance HLA-DR expression at least in those patients
having a dim antigen expression on their plasma cells; that is, the
combined IFN-g/1D09C3 treatment could result in an efficient
antimyeloma activity in at least 50% of MM patients.

Immunomodulatory drugs have been shown to up-regulate IFNg production and increase both natural killer selectivity as well as
affect T-cell subsets (53–55). Moreover, recent data has suggested
that immunomodulatory drugs can also favorably influence the
activity of dendritic cells in this setting (56). The data supporting
the immunomodulatory role of these agents, including thalidomide
and lenalidomide, have been derived preclinically and now most
recently clinically (10, 57). Therefore, a combination therapy using
1D09C3 in association with immunomodulatory drugs might
represent a compelling avenue.
KMS-11 cell line was selected for in vivo studies due to the
specific features of this cells, including expression of HLA-DR at
low intensity, limited responsiveness to 1D09C3 in vitro, and
consistent tumorigenic activity in vivo. Injection of 1D09C3 alone
in NOD/SCID mice xenografted with KMS-11 cells induced a
significant prolongation of median survival and a 25% incidence of
long-term survivors. There was no survival difference between mice
receiving 1D09C3 at 3 or 6 mg/mouse, suggesting that the 3 mg
dose level was capable of fully targeting all the antigen sites.
Interestingly, mice pretreatment with IFN-g resulted in a marked
HLA-DR induction, which translated in a significant enhancement
of 1D09C3 antimyeloma activity, as shown by a 3-fold increase of
median survival and 50% incidence of long-term survivors in mice
receiving IFN-g plus 1D09C3.
In conclusion, our data show that a substantial proportion of
patients with MM express HLA-DR on CD138+ cells and that
expression of this antigen can be efficiently up-regulated by IFN-g,
resulting in a marked enhancement of the in vivo therapeutic
efficacy of 1D09C3. These findings will require further studies and
most importantly translation into clinical trials eventually combining 1D09C3 with immunomodulatory drugs or proteasome
inhibitors to further improve patient outcome.
