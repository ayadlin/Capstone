ABSTRACT
Approximately half of the colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop metastatic
disease. Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy forms the backbone of treatment in
these patients. However, the response to this therapy varies between individuals.
Therefore, an important challenge in CRC research is to identify biomarkers that are
predictive of this response. In this study, we explored the potential of miRNAs, and
the miRNA producing protein Dicer, as biomarkers that can predict chemo-sensitivity
to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC). We analyzed the levels of 22 miRNAs and the Dicer protein in primary tumors
from patients with mCRC who were treated with first-line capecitabine monotherapy
within the CAIRO trial of the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group. Correlation between
the expression status of miRNAs or Dicer in primary tumors and the progression free
survival (PFS) were investigated. Patients with low expression of miR-143 in their
primary tumor had increased median PFS compared to those with high expression
of miR-143. Furthermore, FXYD3, an ion transport regulator and a putative target of
miR-143, also showed an association with PFS. These findings warrant further studies
to investigate the relationship between miR-143, FXYD3 and fluoropyrimidines, and
the clinical utility of miR-143 as biomarker.

INTRODUCTION

patients respond to treatment [3]. Moreover, chemotherapy
is associated with toxicity. Therefore, biomarkers that can
differentiate patients into responders and non-responders
would optimize health care.
Much effort has already been put into the
development of molecular markers predicting the response
to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Thymidylate
synthase (TS) is possibly the most extensively studied
biomarker in this context. However, for the metastatic
setting none of the studied markers is ready for
implementation in daily clinical practice [4].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is worldwide one of the
most common types of cancer, and a leading cause of
cancer death for both men and women (http://globocan.
iarc.fr). Approximately half of the CRC patients develop
metastatic disease, either at diagnosis or during followup [1]. For over 40 years fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine) has been used
in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC),
and significantly prolongs survival [2]. However, not all

inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally. They are
encoded within the genome and are initially transcribed
as large primary transcripts (several kilobases) by RNA
polymerase II. Two RNase III enzymes successively
cleave the primary transcripts, Drosha in the nucleus and
Dicer in the cytoplasm. Ultimately, a 22 nt long singlestranded mature miRNA is incorporated into the multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
as a whole binds to the 3’ untranslated region of a target
messenger RNA (mRNA). Imperfect binding to target
mRNA represses its translation, whereas perfect binding
leads to cleavage and degradation of the target mRNA [5].
MiRNAs influence basic biological processes
such as growth, invasion, proliferation, differentiation,
angiogenesis and cell death. The effect of one specific
miRNA can be widespread, since it can potentially
modulate hundreds of different downstream genes. Altered
miRNA levels are implicated in early tumorigenesis
as well as disease progression. Moreover, there are
indications that they can affect chemo-sensitivity of cancer
cells [6-13]. In combination with their remarkable stability
that allows detection in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) material [14], miRNAs are molecules that could
serve as biomarkers for chemotherapy.
This study was designed to identify a predictive
factor for the response to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy
in patients with mCRC, focusing at the miRNA pathway.
More specifically, we analyzed the expression of Dicer and
22 miRNAs that were shown to be associated with CRC.

miRNAs to (fluoropyrimidine-based) chemotherapy
and/or CRC. In total, we analyzed the mature miRNA
levels of 22 miRNA using stem-loop quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Supplemental
Table 4).
For 55 patients we assessed the relative miRNA
levels in tumor and normal tissue. For five miRNAs
(miR34a, miR-93, miR-19b, miR-92a, miR125b) no
significant difference between expression in tumor and
normal tissue was observed (P > 0.05), for the others there
was a significant difference (Table 1). Especially, miR-31
and miR-21 showed a higher median expression in tumor
tissue, and miR-137 and miR-215 showed lower median
expression in tumor compared to normal tissue (Table 1
and Figure 2).

Evaluation of correlations between Dicer staining
and miRNA levels
For 43 patients we collected both IHC for Dicer
as well as miRNA expression data (Figure 3A). We used
this to investigate if the Dicer staining correlated with the
miRNA expression level data. We compared tumors with
and without staining for Dicer (IHC 0 = 4; IHC 1+2+3 =
39 (Figure 3B). Only, miR-21 and miR-26b showed the
expected positive correlation between Dicer expression
and miRNA level (Figure 3C).

MiR-143 is a putative predictive biomarker

RESULTS

To determine whether any of the 22 miRNAs were
associated with PFS, the patients were sub-divided based
on the median expression of the miRNA in the tumor
tissues, Kaplan-Meier curves were made, log-rank test
performed, and we adjusted for multiple testing. This
approach showed in particular a significant difference for
miR-143 (Table 2). The median PFS of the sub-groups
(median PFS for low expression = 9 months (95%CI:
7-11); median PFS for high expression = 5 months
(95%CI: 4-8)) and the Kaplan-Meier curves suggest that
low miR-143 expression in tumor tissue is associated with
increased PFS (adjusted p-value = 0.012, Figure 4A).
There was no significant difference observed for OS, but
when looking at response, as defined based on RECIST
criteria, there was also a significant difference, with more
response in the sub-group with low miR-143 expression
(p-value = 0.037, Figure 4B). We subsequently checked if
other clinico-pathological characteristics could play a role
as confounders. We observed that, in the sub-group with
low miR-143 expression and increased PFS, the median
age of the patients at diagnosis was somewhat higher
and that the number of cycles of capecitabine that were
administered was higher (Supplemental Table 2 and Figure
4C). Finally, in multivariate Cox regression analysis (using
only the variables that showed a significant difference in

Assessment of associations between Dicer and
survival
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was
performed to study the influence of Dicer expression on
progression free survival (PFS) of mCRC patients who
received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Of the
243 analyzed tumors (Supplemental Table 1 contains the
baseline characteristics of the patients and tumors), only
six tumors showed strong Dicer staining (IHC 3), whereas
most (n = 154) showed a weak staining (IHC 1) (Figure
1A). Survival analysis for this study population did not
show a significant association between PFS and Dicer
staining (Figure 1B).

Comparison of miRNA expression in primary
tumors and matched normal tissue
We next investigated the predictive potential
of miRNAs for patients with mCRC who received
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. The miRNAs were
selected based on literature research for studies linking

univariate analysis) miR-143 expression was the strongest
predictor of PFS (Figure 4D).

In addition, TCGA miRNA-seq and RNA-seq data
were analyzed to select putative target genes. We assumed
that miR-143 degrades its target mRNAs, and selected
those genes that showed a negative correlation with miR143 expression (Supplemental Table 7).
Next, overlaps between the gene lists obtained with
the different approaches were determined. Thirty-four
genes were common in the lists obtained with the target
prediction algorithms (Figure 5A). From this overlap
the gene FXYD3 was the only gene that also showed
a negative correlation. This is a protein that belongs to
a small family of proteins that can regulate sodiumpotassium pumps, with one possible binding site of miR-

Prediction of target genes
One miRNA can regulate many different target
genes, and in principle a small change in miRNA level
could have a large biological effect. To get insight in how
miR-143 and sensitivity to fluoropyrimidines are linked,
two web-based prediction algorithms were used to identify
putative target genes. Both computations generated a
substantial list of candidates (Material and methods,
Supplemental Table 5 and 6).

Among the 43 patients for which we collected both IHC
for FXYD3 and miR-143 expression data there were only
2 tumors with low FXYD3 expression in the cytoplasm
compared to 41 tumors with high FXYD3 expression.
Of all tumors with IHC for FXYD3, 32 tumors
showed weak, whereas 211 showed a strong cytoplasmic
staining (Figure 6B). Interestingly, survival analysis
showed a significant association between PFS and FXYD3
staining in the cytoplasm (Figure 6B). The median PFS
for patients with weak and strong staining was 4 months
(95%CI: 2-6) and 6 months (95%CI: 6-7), respectively.
Thus, for FXYD3 higher expression appears associated
with increased PFS, which is as expected, opposite to the
results for miR-143.
Next, we checked if other clinico-pathological
features could play a role as confounders. For all of the
analyzed characteristics there was no significant difference
between the sub-groups with FXYD3 weak and strong
staining, except for histology and differentiation grade of
the primary tumor. Of the 32 tumors with FXYD3 weak
staining, there were two tumors that were classified as
undifferentiated carcinoma, whereas there was no tumor
with this classification in the 211 tumors with strong
staining (Supplementary Table 3). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis showed that both FXYD3 staining and
differentiation grade were independent predictors for PFS
(HR 1.51; 95%CI 1.03-2.21 and HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.021.15, respectively).

correlation between miRNA and Dicer expression for
most miRNAs. In the study by Stratmann et al (2011),
who used qPCR to measure Dicer levels, there was only
a positive correlation between Dicer expression and
miRNA expression for one out of four miRNAs [17].
An explanation could be that, even though Dicer was
not detected, there was still a low level of Dicer that can
maintain the miRNA levels. On the other hand, it is also
likely that more factors are involved in the biogenesis
and maintenance of miRNA levels. For example, in
zebrafish and mice Argonaute2, instead of Dicer, processes
miRNA-451 [18, 19].
We observed for 17 out of 22 miRNAs a significant
difference in expression between tumor and normal
tissue (Table 1). Our data is consistent with published
studies, in particular for miR-21 [18,39], miR-137
[41,42] and miR-18a [40]. The main aim of this study
was to identify predictive markers for the response to
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy in patients. Reports on
cell line experiments and sometimes xenografts suggested
that expression of miRNAs influences therapeutic efficacy
of 5-fluorouracil, but patient data were generally lacking.
Per miRNA, the association between expression level
and PFS was assessed. For most miRNAs we did not
observe a significant relationship. This could be in part
because the analyzed sample set was too small and/
or too homogeneous with relatively good prognostic
characteristics.
For miR-143 we observed a significant association
between its expression level and PFS. The group with
low miR-143 expression showed longer PFS, suggesting
higher sensitivity to capecitabine. Multivariate analysis
also indicated that miR-143 could be a strong independent
marker for response to capecitabine. In contrast, Borralho
et al (2009) showed that over-expression of miR-143
in the colorectal cell line HCT116 resulted in increased
sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil [20]. This does not fit with
what we observed. However, since miR-143 targets many
genes that each have their own transcriptional regulation,
it could be that the function of miR-143 differs under
different circumstances (e.g. in vivo vs in vitro; early vs
late tumor stage; 5-fluorouracil vs capecitabine).
In an attempt to explain the link between miR-143
down-regulation and increased PFS, putative target genes
were identified. The two web-based prediction algorithms
both gave long lists of genes, but shared relatively few
genes. In addition, we searched in data obtained from the
TCGA portal for negative correlations between miR-143
and mRNAs. Without further research, it is not clear which
list contains the true targets of miRNA-143.
The only gene present in all three lists of putative
target genes was FXYD3/MAT8. FXYD3 has one site in
its 3’ UTR were hybridization of miR-143 is predicted. In
several cancer types expression of FXYD3 appears to be
deregulated [21-27]. Strikingly, FXYD3 is transcriptionally
activated by 5-fluorouracil treatment in the colon cancer

DISCUSSION
A biomarker that allows stratifying patients into
a sub-group that will respond and a subgroup that most
likely does not benefit from the therapy, will contribute
to personalized medicine. In this tissue-based study we
have tested Dicer and several relevant miRNAs for their
predictive value for the response to fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy in patients with mCRC. Among
the selected patients we found that miR-143 could be
used to identify a sub-group that had more benefit from
fluoropyrimidine treatment.
Dicer expression, and its association to overall
survival, was already studied in several CRC patient
populations. For patients with stage II CRC, low Dicer
expression was shown to be associated with improved
survival [15]. In addition, for a group of patients with
mCRC, low Dicer expression was also associated with
better survival [16]. In contrast, in a study with primary
tumors of all stages no relationship between Dicer
expression and survival was found [17]. Similar to
the other studies, we observed variable levels of Dicer
expression in CRC. However, the Dicer expression could
not be linked to PFS of patients with mCRC treated with
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
Furthermore, even though Dicer is a central enzyme
in miRNA processing, in this study there was no clear

cell line H630 [28]. If miR-143 negatively regulates
FXYD3 expression then it is expected that low expression
of FXYD3 is associated with worse PFS. This is indeed
what we observed with the IHC analysis.
FXYD3 is a member of the small FXYD protein
family. Each member is a small trans-membrane protein
that has the short signature motif PFXYD (Pro, Phe, X,
Tyr, Asp). It was shown that the FXYD proteins associate
with the Na-K-ATPase (also known as sodium-potassium
pump), which maintains the Na+ and K+ gradients across
the plasma membrane. The FXYD proteins modulate the
transport properties of the Na-K-ATPase [29, 30]. The
Na+ and K+ gradient is essential in preservation of cell
volume and the membrane potential. In addition, the Na+
gradient provides the energy for the activity of secondary
transporters that transport numerous solutes, including
other ions, glucose, and amino acids [31]. With this in
mind it is conceivable that FXYD3 indirectly affects
(nucleoside or nucleobase) transporters that are involved
in the uptake of fluoropyrimidines (or metabolites of
fluoropyrimidines), and that variations in expression of
FXYD3 might lead to altered transport and could manifest
as differences in cytotoxicity or response.
In summary, in this study we observe a relationship
between miR-143 expression and PFS. Further preclinical studies are now necessary for the validation
of miR-143 as predictive marker of the response to
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in mCRC patients.
In addition, investigation of the target genes of miR-143,
and in particular FXYD3, will be useful to elucidate how
fluoropyrimidines and miR-143 are connected.

translational research on tumor tissue.
Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed
on 243 tumor samples of patients treated with first line
capecitabine monotherapy (arm A) for whom sufficient
tumor material was available. For the miRNA analysis 55
patients treated with first line capecitabine monotherapy
(arm A) were selected that had performance score
0, normal serum LDH, received at least 3 cycles of
capecitabine, received no prior adjuvant chemotherapy
and for whom formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
material of the primary tumor as well as normal tissue was
available. Supplemental Table 1, 2 contain the baseline
characteristics of the patients included in the protein and
miRNA detection analyses, respectively.

Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays
IHC analysis was performed on Tissue Micro Arrays
(TMAs) containing primary tumor material. To assemble
the arrays punches of 2 mm were taken from the FFPE
primary tumor tissues. From each TMA, a 4 μm section
was mounted on glass, de-paraffinised and re-hydrated.
The staining of Dicer was performed on a Ventana
Benchmark XT autostainer with the XT ultraView DAB
Kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch, France) using
an antibody reacting with Dicer (Anti-DICER1, 1:75,
Sigma–Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany). The slides were
counterstained with Haematoxylin (Vector Laboratories).
Different staining intensities were observed, and the
scoring was performed as previously described [15].
Tumors were scored from 0 to 3, considering only the
cytoplasmic area. Sections were evaluated three times,
blinded to outcome data. The mean of all three values was
then calculated and each sample was assigned to one of
the four different IHC-staining categories (0–3).
For the staining of FXYD3, microwave antigen
retrieval was performed using 10mM sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes. After blocking endogenous
peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 for 20 minutes, slides
were incubated with rabbit anti-human polyclonal FXYD3
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, 1:200)
overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, slides were incubated with
Powervision Poly-HRP anti-Ms/Rb/Ra IgG (Immunologic,
Duiven, The Netherlands) and developed using
PowerDAB (Immunologic, Duiven, The Netherlands).
Furthermore, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin
(Vector Laboratories).
The staining intensity of the cytoplasm was
graded as weak (light brown) and strong (brown). All
sections were evaluated blinded to outcome data by two
independent observers. Discrepancies in scoring were
evaluated by the two observers together to obtain an
agreement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection
The patients included in this study participated in
the CAIRO study (ClinTrials.gov NCT00312000) of
the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) [3]. In this
multicenter phase III study, 820 patients with advanced
CRC were randomized between sequential (Arm A)
and combination (Arm B) treatment with capecitabine,
irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The primary end point of the
study was overall survival (OS), and was calculated as
the interval from the date of randomization until death
from any cause or until the date of last follow-up. The
secondary objectives included PFS and tumor response.
PFS for first-line treatment was calculated from the
date of randomization to the first observation of disease
progression or death from any cause. Assessment of tumor
response was performed with computed tomography (CT)
scans using to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The written informed consent
required for all patients before study entry also included

RNA extraction and miRNA assays

MiRNA target prediction

Total RNA was isolated from FFPE tissue using
the RecoverAllTM Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster city, USA). To ensure a
high percentage of tumor cells, the tumor tissue sections
were macro dissected. Matched normal mucosal RNA
was obtained from the resection margins or at least 1 cm
distance from the tumor. In brief, four tissue sections of 20
µm were incubated with 100% xylene at 50°C to remove
paraffin excess, followed by ethanol washes. Proteins
were degraded by protease at 50° and 80°C. The RNA
was extracted followed by nuclease digestion. Total RNA
quantity and quality were determined using the Nanodrop
26 ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies
Inc., Wilmington, USA).
The expression levels of miRNAs were determined
by means of Taqman microRNA assays (Supplemental
Table 4 contains a list with the assays), following the
manufacture’s protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
USA). First, cDNA was synthesized in triplicate from
total RNA using the Human pool A Megaplex RT primers.
Reverse transcriptase reactions were conducted using 66
ng total RNA, 2.67 mM dNTPs, 75 U MultiScribe Reverse
Transcriptase, 1x RT buffer, 2 U RNase inhibitor, 3 mM
MgCl2 and 1x Taqman MicroRNA RT Primers (Applied
Biosystems, Foster city, USA). The 7.5 µl reactions were
incubated for 40 cycles for 2 minutes at 16°C, 1 minute at
42°C and 1 second at 50°C followed by 5 minutes at 85°C
for 5 minutes.
Pre-amplification was subsequently performed on
2.5 µl of synthesized cDNA in a total reaction of 22.5 µl
of 1x Taqman PreAmp Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster city, USA). The reactions were incubated for 10
minutes at 95°C, 2 minutes at 55°C, 2 minutes at 72°C,
12 cycles of 15 second at 95°C and 4 minutes at 60°C, 10
minutes at 99.9°C.
The quantitative PCR was performed in a total
mixture of 10 µl consisting of 0.1 µl RT product (1:4
diluted from pre-amplified RT reaction), 1 x Taqman
Universal PCR Master Mix (No AmpErase® UNG,
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and 1 x the
dedicated primer and probe mix. The reactions were
incubated in a 96-well optical plate at 95°C for 10
minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds
and at 60°C for 1 minute. All reactions were carried out
in duplicate in a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Due to the plate set-up
it was necessary to correct for inter plate variation by
incorporating an IPC, in triplicate (data for stability testing
not shown). The threshold cycle (Cq) was defined as the
fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes
the fixed threshold. Relative quantification of miRNA
expression was calculated using the ΔCq method using
GenEx software [32].

Lists of potential targets for miRNAs were created
using the prediction algorithms TargetScan Release 6.2
and MicroCosm Targets Version 5 [33, 34].
To identify genes that show loss of expression
upon increased miRNA expression, data from the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) was downloaded on the 25th of
April 2013. The following filter settings were used to
search in the data portal: Disease: COAD; Data Level: 3;
Availability: Available. In total, we obtained IlluminaGA
miRNASeq and RNASeq data for 177 tumor samples.
The Spearman correlation and accompanying p-value was
calculated for miR-143 expression and the expression of
each mRNA. Genes with a negative rho and a p-value
below 0.05 were considered putative target genes.
Overlaps between the lists of putative target genes
were identified and visualized with a Venn diagram. Gene
ontology analysis was performed using the web-based tool
DAVID [35, 36].

Data analysis
The qPCR data was analyzed using the GenEx
software (MultID v.5.3.4, Göteborg, Sweden). Application
of NormFinder resulted in the use of miR-17, miR-19a,
miR-20a and miR-24 as reference genes, as its combined
use led to the lowest accumulated standard deviation.
The suitability of these genes was confirmed by GeNorm
analysis [37, 38]. The miRNA expression in tumor tissue
is compared with the expression in normal tissue using the
Wilcoxon signed rank test. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to make survival curves. The survival distributions
were compared with the log-rank test. The distributions
of clinico-pathological characteristics in different groups
were compared with Fisher’s exact test or Wilcoxon rank
sum test. Correction for multiple testing was performed
with the Benjamini & Hochberg adjustment method.
Multivariate survival analysis was performed with Cox
proportional hazards regression. Statistical procedures
were performed with R.
