BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of alisertib (MLN8237) in
combination with docetaxel and to identify a recommended dose for the combination. METHODS: Adults with metastatic cancer
were treated on 21-day cycles with alisertib (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg) twice daily on days 1 to 7 or days 1 to 5 and with docetaxel (75 or
60 mg/m2) on day 1. The primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies. Secondary objectives included an efficacy assessment and PK analyses of docetaxel and alisertib. RESULTS: Forty-one patients participated. Eight dose levels were explored with various doses of alisertib and
docetaxel. The dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenic fever, neutropenia without fever, stomatitis, and urinary tract infection. The
RP2D of this combination was 20 mg of alisertib twice daily on days 1 to 7 and intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in 21-day
cycles. Eight of the 28 patients (29%) who were efficacy-evaluable had objective responses. These included 1 complete response in a
patient with bladder cancer, 6 partial responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, and 1 partial response in a
patient with angiosarcoma. Concomitant administration of alisertib did not produce any clinically meaningful change in docetaxel PK.
CONCLUSIONS: Alisertib at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 7 with intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in a 21-day cycle was

INTRODUCTION
Aurora kinases play a critical role in cell division in the G2-M phase through their participation in chromosomal agglutination and segregation, spindle formation, centrosomal maturation, and cytokinesis.1-10 Overexpression of aurora A kinase
(AAK) is carcinogenic and has been implicated in the development of breast, bladder, colon, ovarian, pancreatic, and
stomach cancers.11,12 After cancer development, the levels of AAK may be prognostic of survival, with increased levels correlating with shorter survival.13
Preclinical systems examining the effect of AAK inhibition on cancer have demonstrated an anticancer response, and
AAK overexpression leads to resistance to taxane-based therapy.14-18 For example, RNA silencing of AAK in a pancreatic
cancer model suppressed cancer growth.16 Furthermore, RNA silencing of AAK sensitized the pancreatic cancer cell line
to treatment with taxanes, which also work at the level of microtubules, perhaps through recovered spindle checkpoint activity. The antitumor activity of alisertib (MLN8237) combined with taxanes has also been evaluated in mice bearing 3
xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer.18 In each tumor model, the combination led to greater tumor growth inhibition in comparison with the single agents, additive or synergistic antitumor activity during dosing, and prolonged tumor growth delay after treatment discontinuation.
Alisertib is an AAK inhibitor that has shown single-agent activity in small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, head and
neck cancer, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and various hematologic malignancies.19-22 Previously
published studies of adults established a single-agent recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 50 mg twice daily for 7 days of

Phase 1 Study of Alisertib (MLN8237)/Graff et al

a 21-day cycle.19,20,22 At the single-agent RP2D, a cycle 1
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 4 febrile neutropenia
was observed in 1 of 13 patients. The most common drugrelated adverse event (AE) was neutropenia (50%). When it
was administered as a single agent, exposures achieved at
doses of 30 to 50 mg twice daily were associated with tumor
pharmacodynamic effects of decreases in chromosome
alignment and spindle bipolarity in tumor mitotic cells.23
Here we present the results of a phase 1, open-label,
dose-escalation study of the AAK inhibitor alisertib combined
with the taxane docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was initially designed as a phase 1/2 study for
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but enrollment was slow so the study was
expanded with amendment 2 to enroll patients with
diverse types of solid tumors, and the randomized phase 2
portion was removed. The administration of prednisone
was also removed from the study with amendment 2
because this was no longer standard-of-care treatment for
other solid tumors. The primary objectives of this phase 1
study were to assess the safety and tolerability of alisertib
administered to patients with solid tumors and to determine the RP2D and schedule of the combination regimen
of alisertib and docetaxel. The secondary objectives were
to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alisertib and
docetaxel administered in combination and to assess any
efficacy of this combination treatment in patients with
advanced solid tumors.
For the dose-finding portion, a cycle 1 DLT was
defined as either a hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity that the investigator deemed to be related to the study
drug and that met the following criteria. Hematologic
DLTs included grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7
consecutive days, grade 4 neutropenia associated with a
coincident fever (where fever is defined as an oral temperature  38.58C) or systemic infection, grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting more than 7 consecutive days, a platelet
count < 10,000/mm3 at any time, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with significant bleeding, and a delay in the initiation of the subsequent cycle of therapy by more than 7
days due to treatment-related toxicity. Nonhematologic
DLTs included grade 3 or higher nausea or emesis that
occurred despite the use of optimal antiemetic therapy (a
5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin receptor antagonist), diarrhea despite optimal supportive therapy with loperamide, and fatigue lasting more than 7 consecutive days. If
a grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was controllable to
grade 2 or lower with appropriate treatment, it was not

considered a DLT. All toxicities were graded with the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Eligibility

Patients were eligible if they had histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors and were candidates
for docetaxel treatment as determined by the investigator.
Other eligibility requirements included an age  18 years,
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count  1500 cells/mm3 without growth factor
support, platelet count  100,000 cells/mm3 without transfusion or growth factor requirements, and hemoglobin level
> 9 g/dL), renal function (calculated creatinine clearance 
40 mL/min), and liver function (total bilirubin  upper
limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase  1.5 3 upper limit of normal). The use of opiates had to be stable for at least 2 weeks before study entry.
All patients were required to use contraception if they were
sexually active and fertile. Key exclusion criteria included
antineoplastic therapy or any experimental therapy within
21 days of starting alisertib, prior use of investigational
therapies within 4 weeks of enrollment, radiotherapy of
40% of bone marrow over a lifetime or any radiation
within 4 weeks of enrollment, a history of allogeneic stem
cell transplantation, use of enzyme-inducing epileptic drugs
or St. John’s wort within 14 days of alisertib exposure,
chronic steroid therapy, more than 3 myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, and prior treatment with
more than 1 taxane. Patients with mCRPC could not have
had prior treatment with a taxane for advanced disease,
used a first-generation androgen receptor antagonist within
6 weeks of enrollment, or used agents known to decrease
prostate-specific antigen (PSA; eg, PC-SPES, saw palmetto,
or finasteride). Patients with mCRPC had to either have
undergone bilateral orchiectomy or remained on medical
therapy for castration (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy). Safety evaluations
were performed through a history, physical, and labs on day
1 of each cycle. Efficacy evaluations were conducted according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST; version 1.1). All patients with small cell lung
cancer and non–small cell lung cancer were to have brain
imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast or computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, regardless of their symptoms. Patients with
mCRPC and evaluable disease according to CT or MRI at
screening were required to have a bone scan. Repeat bone
scans along with CT and/or MRI scans were to be

performed within the 7 days before the completion of cycle
3 and every third cycle between days 15 and 21 until progressive disease was documented. Those without castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) underwent CT or MRI
with contrast at screening at the baseline and every 3 cycles.
Tumor markers, including PSA, were collected at the baseline, on day 1 of each cycle, and at the end of the treatment
visit. The overall response rate (ORR) was defined as partial
responses (PRs) plus complete responses (CRs). Responseevaluable was defined as either RECIST-evaluable (having
baseline-measurable disease and at least 1 postbaseline
response assessment) or PSA-evaluable (having a baseline
PSA level  2 ng/mL and having at least 12 weeks of post
PSA assessment). For PSA response or non-response, Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 guidelines were used.24 This
study was conducted under a prospective clinical trial protocol approved by each institution’s institutional review
board. All participants provided written informed consent

venous infusion on day 1 of each treatment cycle, and oral
prednisone at 5 mg twice daily (Fig. 1). The maximum
alisertib dose administered was to be 700 mg per treatment cycle even if shorter treatment cycles were evaluated,
and the maximum dose of docetaxel was to be 75 mg/m2.
When alisertib was administered on the same day as the
dose of docetaxel, alisertib was administered approximately 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion. One patient
in the second cohort, enrolled before amendment 2,
received prednisone at 5 mg twice daily.
Subsequent cohorts were to escalate with an accelerated design by 100% (10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then
20 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, and then 40 mg orally
twice daily for 7 days) in the absence of any DLT. If at
least 1 DLT was observed within the first 2 cohorts, subsequent dose escalation of alisertib above 20 mg twice daily
was to be performed with a maximum of 40% increments
(adjusted to accommodate the tablet size). The number of
patients enrolled at any dose level was to be expanded up
to 3 additional patients if 1 DLT was experienced in the
first 3 patients. Alisertib and docetaxel doses could be
reduced for a single patient for toxicities.

Treatment Administration by Cohort

This was a 3 1 3 escalating-dose cohort trial design. The
first cohort was administered oral alisertib at 10 mg twice
daily (total, 20 mg/day) on days 1 to 7 of each 21-day
treatment cycle, docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 by a 1-hour intra2526

PK Analysis

alisertib doses were held on days 1 and 2 to enable the
characterization of docetaxel PK on day 1 of cycle 2 in the
absence of concomitantly administered alisertib.
Blood samples were collected within the hour before
the start of the docetaxel infusion; at the end of the infusion (immediately before the infusion pump was switched
off); 5 minutes (61 minute), 15 minutes (63 minutes),
0.5 hours (65 minutes), 1 hour (610 minutes), 2 hours
(620 minutes), 4 hours (620 minutes), 6 hours (630
minutes), and 8 hours (630 minutes) after the docetaxel
infusion was stopped; and 24 hours (62 hours) and 48
hours (6 2hours) after the start of the docetaxel infusion.
Samples were spun down within an hour of collection,
and the plasma layer was removed and stored at –808C at
local sites until it was shipped. Blood samples for alisertib
plasma PK measurements were collected at the following
time points after the cycle 1 day 1 and day 7 doses: immediately before alisertib dosing and 1 hour (610 minutes),
2 hours (620 minutes), 3 hours (620 minutes), 4 hours
(620 minutes), 6 hours (630 minutes), 8 hours (630
minutes), 10 hours (61 hour), and 12 hours (61 hour)
after alisertib dosing. The bioanalytical assays were conducted at Tandem Labs (West Trenton, NJ). Docetaxel
samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.
The dynamic range for docetaxel was 1 to 500 ng/mL. Alisertib plasma samples were analyzed with a validated LCMS/MS method.23 The dynamic range for alisertib was 5
to 2500 ng/mL. Individual plasma concentration-time
data were used for noncompartmental analysis with Phoenix WinNonlin (version 6.2; Pharsight Corporation,
Cary, NC). Plasma concentrations below the lower limit
of quantification of the bioanalytical assay were set to zero
for the purposes of noncompartmental analysis.
Statistical Analysis

Approximately 5 different doses of alisertib combined with
a fixed dose of docetaxel were planned for evaluation to
identify the RP2D of the combination. Dose escalation was
conducted according to a traditional 3 1 3 dose-escalation
rule, with 3 to 6 patients evaluated at each dose level. There
was to be an expansion in the RP2D cohort to evaluate at
least 12 patients completing 2 cycles of the protocolspecified dosing and PK assessments. It was anticipated
that 10% of the patients would not be evaluable for DLTs,
PK, or both, so the enrollment of 40 patients was planned.
Plasma concentrations of alisertib and docetaxel
were summarized by the postdose time and grouped by
the dose schedule, dose group, and dosing cycle and day.
Mean and individual plasma concentration-time data also

were plotted by dose schedule, dose group, and dosing
cycle and day. The summary statistics for PK parameters
were the number, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of
variation, median, minimum, maximum, and geometric
mean (except for the time at which the maximum concentration was observed [Tmax]). The summary statistics for
Tmax were the number, median, minimum, and maximum. The effect of the concomitant administration of alisertib on the PK of docetaxel was also investigated. An
analysis of variance was performed with log-transformed
docetaxel maximum concentration, Area under the curve
from baseline to final time of detectable drug (AUC0-last),
and total drug exposure over time (AUC0-1) values as dependent variables, with the treatment state (administration in the presence of alisertib vs the absence of alisertib)
as the fixed effect, and with the patient as the random
effect. Geometric least squares mean ratios between the
treatment states were calculated along with 90% confidence intervals.
Safety evaluations were based on the incidence, severity, and types of AEs, clinically significant changes in
physical examination findings, vital signs measurements,
electrocardiography, and clinical laboratory results.

RESULTS
Screening, Enrollment, and Baseline
Characteristics

Subjects were enrolled at 4 centers (Oregon Health & Science University, University of Washington, University of
Texas Health Science Center, and Indiana University). Of
the 63 patients screened, 41 participated in the clinical
trial, with the patient characteristics summarized in Table
1. The median age was 63.0 years (range, 25-87 years).
Most patients were white (93%) and male (73%); 2
patients (5%) were black, and 1 (2%) was Chinese. Eighteen patients (44%) had a primary diagnosis of prostate
cancer, and 23 (56%) had other tumor types: 5 had non–
small cell lung cancer; 4 had bladder cancer; 3 had sarcoma; 2 had urothelial cancer; and 1 each had Merkel cell
carcinoma, a brain tumor (meningioma), collecting duct
carcinoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer,
esophageal cancer, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, and
cervical cancer.
For the 18 patients with CRPC, the median age was
68.5 years (range, 49-87 years). The median Gleason
grade was 9 (range, 5-10), and the median baseline
(screening) PSA level was 68.72 ng/mL (range, 3.04881.36 ng/mL).

Safety

treatment cycles was 3 (range, 1-36 cycles), and nearly
half of the patients were treated for 5 or more cycles. Six
patients received treatment with alisertib for at least 1 year
for 17 to 36 cycles, with docetaxel treatment ranging from
9 to 26 cycles. For each of these patients, the number of
administered cycles of docetaxel was less than the number
of administered cycles of alisertib. The reason for discontinuation in all 6 patients was disease progression. The
most common AE was neutropenia (83%).
There were 32 patients in the dose-finding cohorts,
but only 31 were included in the DLT-evaluable portion
because 1 patient (with prostate cancer) received filgrastim on day 8 of cycle 1, which confounded the interpretation of the safety data. Eleven patients reported cycle 1
DLTs as described later and shown in Table 2.
In the first 2 cohorts, 1 of 6 patients developed a
DLT. In the third cohort, 2 of 5 patients developed
DLTs. The decision was made to reduce the number of
days of alisertib treatment from 7 to 5 days for the fourth
cohort, but 2 of 3 patients had a DLT. The dose of docetaxel was decreased for the next cohort to 60 mg/m2 on
day 1 with oral alisertib at 30 mg twice daily for 7 days,
but 2 of 2 patients had a DLT. For the next cohort, alisertib at 30 mg twice daily was given for 5 days with
reduced-dose docetaxel, and 1 of 4 had a DLT. This
cohort was closed early because the investigators were concerned that docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 was inadequate for the

diseases under study. Prophylactic granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF; neulasta administered on day
6) was included for the next cohort (alisertib at 30 mg
twice daily for 5 days with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2), and
there were no DLTs for the 3 patients. Notably, 1 patient
with prostate cancer was dosed at the cohort 8 level of 40
mg twice daily for 5 days in error and was assessed as part
of cohort 8. Cohort 7 was considered inferior to cohort 2
because the total dose of alisertib was similar and G-CSF
was not required in cohort 2. In the final cohort (cohort
8), 2 of the 4 patients who received alisertib orally at 40
mg twice daily for 5 days with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 on
day 1 plus G-CSF had DLTs. Therefore, the RP2D was
determined to be 20 mg of alisertib twice daily for 7 days
with intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 on day 1. The
most common DLTs were neutropenic fever (n 5 5) and
neutropenia without fever (n 5 4), which were followed
by stomatitis (n 5 2) and urinary tract infection (n 5 1).

Serious adverse events (SAEs; treatment-emergent,
all-causality) occurred in 24 patients (59%). SAEs occurring in more than 1 subject included febrile neutropenia
(27%), stomatitis (7%), and urinary tract infection (7%)
as well as Clostridium difficile colitis, pneumonia, dyspnea,
neutropenia, anemia, diarrhea, dehydration, and acute renal failure at 5%. In the RP2D cohort, SAEs (treatmentemergent, all-causality) were reported for 8 patients
(53%); they included 5 febrile neutropenia events (33%)
and 1 each (7%) of the following events: neutropenia,
anemia, urinary tract infection, stomatitis, dyspnea, and
acute renal failure.
Five patients (12%) had at least 1 AE that led to
study discontinuation. They included 3 patients who discontinued treatment because of AEs in the RP2D cohort:
1 patient discontinued treatment during cycle 1 because
of grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 stomatitis
(both treatment-related), and 2 other patients in this

cohort discontinued treatment because of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy (cycle 9) and grade 3 brain metastases
(cycle 2). Both events were reported to not be treatmentrelated. In the cohort administered alisertib at 30 mg
twice daily for 5 days plus docetaxel at 75 mg/m2, 1
patient died in cycle 2 (non–treatment-related grade 5
dyspnea), and in the cohort administered alisertib at 30
mg twice daily for 7 days plus docetaxel at 75 mg/m2, 1
patient discontinued treatment in cycle 2 because of grade
3 treatment-related dyspepsia.
Seven patients (17%) had a dose reduction of alisertib for an AE; they included 1 patient (6.7%) in the
RP2D cohort. Ten patients (24%) had at least 1 alisertib
dose held, and they included 1 patient (6.7%) in the
RP2D cohort. Eight patients (20%) had at least 1 alisertib
dose delay, and they included 3 patients (20%) in the
RP2D cohort.
Eight patients (20%) had a dose reduction of docetaxel due to an AE, and they included 4 patients (27%) in
the RP2D cohort. One patient (2%) had at least 1 docetaxel dose held; this was a patient (7%) in the RP2D
cohort. Eight patients (20%) had at least 1 docetaxel dose
delay, and they included 4 patients (27%) in the RP2D
cohort. All docetaxel dose reductions occurred at the 75
mg/m2 dose. The following 17 treatment-related events
led to dose reductions: grade 1 muscle weakness, grade
3 Pseudomonas infection, grade 4 febrile neutropenia
(3 events), grade 2 peripheral edema, grade 1 worsening
sensory peripheral neuropathy, grade 2 fatigue, grade 3
diarrhea, grade 4 neutropenia (6 events), grade 3 neutropenia, and grade 3 dehydration.
Efficacy

There were 28 patients (68%) who were responseevaluable. Thirteen patients (32%) did not provide post2530

baseline assessments and, therefore, were not responseevaluable. The best ORR was 29% (8 of 28). Three responders were in the first cohort (10 mg twice daily), and
the others were spread over 5 different cohorts, as shown
in Table 4. Seven patients had a PR, and they included 6
patients with CRPC and 1 patient with angiosarcoma.
One patient with bladder cancer had a CR. However, this
patient initially had a PR, which was then converted to a
CR after a bladder instillation of bacille Calmette-Guerin;
this confounded the results. Stable disease was achieved in
11 (39%), and progressive disease occurred in 8 patients
(29%).
Of the 18 patients with CRPC, 14 (78%) were
evaluable by either RECIST13 or PSA response criteria.12
The ORR was 43% (6 of 14) and included either PSA or
RECIST. All 6 responders had a PR. Three of the 6 responders received prednisone as part of their study regimen. Six patients had stable disease as their best overall
response. Of the 12 patients in the PSA-evaluable group,
9 (75%) had a PSA reduction  50%. One patient had a
best response of progressive disease.
PK Results

Clinical PK data were obtained from 41 patients (39 for
docetaxel and 41 for alisertib). There were 8 patients (3
for docetaxel and 5 for alisertib) whose data could not be
used for noncompartmental PK analyses because of an
interruption of the infusion or multiple missed sample
collections.
Docetaxel PK

In this study, oral alisertib was administered at 10 to 40
mg twice daily on days 1 to 5 or days 1 to 7 and intravenous docetaxel was administered at 75 or 60 mg/m2 on
day 1 in 21-day treatment cycles. During cycle 2, alisertib

range of 10 to 40 mg twice daily.

doses were held on days 1 and 2 to enable the characterization of docetaxel PK on day 1 of cycle 2 in the absence of
alisertib (to serve as a reference for comparison with docetaxel PK when it was administered concomitantly with alisertib on day 1 of cycle 1). Supporting Table 1 (see online
supporting information) summarizes the key PK parameters of docetaxel on day 1 of cycle 1 (alisertib with docetaxel) and day 1 of cycle 2 (docetaxel alone). There was no
consistent effect of alisertib on docetaxel PK over the alisertib dose range of 10 to 40 mg twice daily.
Docetaxel PK data from 13 patients treated at the
RP2D were used to assess the effect of alisertib on docetaxel PK (Fig. 2). At the RP2D of the combination, the
geometric mean AUC0-1 value of docetaxel achieved at
75 mg/m2 when it was administered with alisertib at 20
mg twice daily was 125% of that observed with docetaxel
alone with a 90% confidence interval of 94% to 147%.
The individual values of AUC0-1 in the presence of alisertib overlapped substantially with the range of individual
values of AUC0-1 observed in the absence of alisertib,
and this suggests that the observed 25% higher geometric
mean AUC0-1 value of docetaxel during the period of
concomitant administration of alisertib at the RP2D of
the combination is likely not of clinical relevance.
Alisertib PK

PK assessments for alisertib were performed on days 1 and
7 (day 5 if alisertib was given on a 5-day schedule) during
cycle 1. Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information) summarizes the PK parameters of alisertib on
days 1 and 7 (or day 5) during cycle 1.

DISCUSSION
The RP2D was determined to be 20 mg of oral alisertib
twice daily on days 1 to 7 plus intravenous docetaxel at 75
mg/m2 on day 1 in 21-day treatment cycles. Attempts to
increase the dose of alisertib to 30 or 40 mg twice daily
included decreasing the dose of docetaxel, shortening the
course of alisertib from days 1 to 7 to days 1 to 5, and
including growth factor support. Ultimately, it was
decided that we should not decrease exposure to docetaxel
by decreasing the dose because docetaxel has a known
benefit in these patients, a shorter course of 30 mg of alisertib twice daily did not give much more total exposure
than a longer course of 20 mg of alisertib twice daily, and
despite growth factor support, patients still developed significant neutropenia. The 20-mg twice daily dose of alisertib is below the dosage associated with robust tumor
pharmacodynamic effects and expected antitumor activity
when alisertib is given as a single-agent therapy (30-50 mg
twice daily). However, there may still be enhancement of
efficacy (eg, via additive or synergistic effects) in the combination setting of the coadministration of the 2 agents,
and future trials could help with this determination.
On the basis of the PK data, no consistent effect of
alisertib on docetaxel PK was observed across the dose levels/cohorts evaluated. Steady-state exposures of alisertib
on day 7 or day 5 increased in an approximately doseproportional manner over the alisertib dose range of 10 to
40 mg twice daily, and this was consistent with previous
clinical PK data on alisertib.24 The steady-state exposures
of alisertib (AUC0-s) on day 7 or day 5 were within the
range of exposures that have been observed with singleagent administration.23
Antitumor activity was seen in patients with CRPC,
bladder cancer, and angiosarcoma. Six of the RECISTevaluable patients (46%) with CRPC achieved a best
response of PR, with 1 of these responses occurring in the
RP2D cohort. A PSA reduction  50% occurred in 75%
of the PSA-evaluable patients. This is higher than the
50% reduction expected after treatment with single-agent
docetaxel and prednisone,25,26 but the number of patients
in this study was too small for any conclusions to be
drawn. Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD)/RP2D of alisertib achieved in this study (20 mg
twice daily) in combination with docetaxel is substantially
below the single-agent alisertib MTD/RP2D (50 mg
twice daily). Clinical exposure-pharmacodynamic (PD)
2531

Original Article

analyses of single-agent alisertib have indicated that a
twice daily dose range of 30 to 50 mg is associated with
AAK-inhibitory tumor pharmacodynamic effects.23
Although additive and/or synergistic antitumor effects in
the combination setting may potentially lead to clinically
meaningful enhancement of the efficacy of docetaxel by
alisertib at 20 mg twice daily, it should be noted that the
MTD/RP2D achieved for this combination does not provide exposures that fall within a robust, pharmacodynamically active range established for single-agent alisertib.
Therefore, further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of
this combination should consider the results of this phase
1 study viewed in the context of the clinical pharmacology
of single-agent alisertib and the translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) understanding of alisertib in combination with taxanes.18
The neuroendocrine subtype of prostate cancer can
form later in the course of the disease after castration resistance develops.27 Responses to typical prostate cancer
therapies in the neuroendocrine subtype are disappointing,28,29 but there are treatments in development. AAK
has been identified as a potential target for neuroendocrine prostate cancer, and there is an ongoing phase 2
study examining alisertib with continued castration in
CRPC with an emphasis on the neuroendocrine subtype
(NCT01799278).
Six patients (15%) had metastatic bladder cancer resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy: 1 patient had a
PR and a total duration of response of 830 days (36 treatment cycles), and 1 patient had stable disease for 309 days
(15 treatment cycles). Three of the patients were not
response-evaluable because no postbaseline imaging was
performed, and 1 patient had disease progression at first
imaging. Bladder cancer has broad dysregulation of aurora
A and aurora B kinases, and preclinical evidence suggests
that alisertib would be beneficial in this population.30
Furthermore, the median survival of bladder cancer
patients receiving second-line therapy in a phase 3 study
ranged from 4.6 to 8 months, so responses in this population were also of great interest.31,32
In conclusion, 20 mg of alisertib twice daily for days
1 to 7 with intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in
a 21-day cycle was well tolerated, and the combination
demonstrated antitumor activity for various cancer types.
The potential future development of this drug combination at the RP2D warrants taking into account the currently known pharmacodynamically active dose range of
alisertib, the translational PK/PD understanding of
alisertib-taxane combinations, and the toxicity profiles of
the combination of alisertib and docetaxel.
