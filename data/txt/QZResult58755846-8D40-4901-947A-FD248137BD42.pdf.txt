Estrogen receptor a (ERa) is initially expressed in the majority of breast cancers and promotes estrogen-dependent cancer
progression by regulating the transcription of genes linked to cell proliferation. ERa status is of clinical importance, as ERa-positive
breast cancers can be successfully treated by adjuvant therapy with antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors. Complications arise from
the frequent development of drug resistance that might be caused by multiple alterations, including components of ERa signaling,
during tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, insights into the molecular mechanisms that control ERa expression and
stability are of utmost importance to improve breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we report that the atypical E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF31 stabilizes ERa and facilitates ERa-stimulated proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. We show that depletion
of RNF31 decreases the number of cells in the S phase and reduces the levels of ERa and its downstream target genes, including
cyclin D1 and c-myc. Analysis of data from clinical samples conﬁrms correlation between RNF31 expression and the expression of
ERa target genes. Immunoprecipitation indicates that RNF31 associates with ERa and increases its stability and monoubiquitination, dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF31. Our data suggest that association of RNF31 and ERa occurs
mainly in the cytosol, consistent with the lack of RNF31 recruitment to ERa-occupied promoters. In conclusion, our study establishes
a non-genomic mechanism by which RNF31 via stabilizing ERa levels controls the transcription of estrogen-dependent genes linked
to breast cancer cell proliferation.

INTRODUCTION
The relationship between estrogen signaling and breast cancer
was revealed nearly 80 years ago.1 The subsequent discovery and
clinical application of antiestrogens and of aromatase inhibitors
brought signiﬁcant survival beneﬁts to breast cancer patients.2,3
However, up to 40% of patients receiving adjuvant therapy
eventually relapse, making resistance to endocrine therapy a
signiﬁcant clinical problem.2,4 Thus, a detailed understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and insight into new facets and
components of estrogen signaling is critical in developing novel
treatment strategies.
Estrogen is known to exert its function by binding to estrogen
receptor (ER) subtypes, ERa and ERb, which belong to the nuclear
receptor family of transcription factors.5 ERa has a main role in
breast cancer initiation and proliferation. Overexpression of ERa
accelerates the G1-S phase transition, correlating with increased
levels of oncogenic proteins, including cyclin D1 and c-myc.6 These
proteins promote cell cycle progression by decreasing the level of
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip/WAF1 and p27Kip1, the
activity of which is essential for cell cycle progression.7 Clinically,
ERa levels in dysplastic breast epithelial cells correlate with the risk
of breast cancer and response to endocrine therapy, and twothirds of all breast cancers express high levels of ERa.8,9
There are a number of possible and conﬁrmed mechanisms for
the dysregulation of ERa that trigger inappropriate estrogen
signaling and drug resistance in breast cancer. Some may relate to

the transcriptional and epigenetic control of ERa expression,10,11
others to the control of ERa activity via ligands, growth factors and
post-translational modiﬁcations.12–14 However, our understanding
of how ERa protein levels and stability are controlled in breast
cancers remains largely unclear. As obvious candidates emerge
components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including
numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases, having been shown to have
important roles in breast cancer by modulating estrogen signaling.
For example, enzymes such as BRCA1, MDM2 and CHIP have been
demonstrated to ubiquitinate ERa, suggesting that they directly
trigger proteasomal degradation.11,13,15,16 Despite these
seemingly distinct mechanisms, a unifying model emerges
wherein ERa turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome system
appears tightly linked to ER-mediated transcription. In fact, E3
ligases appear to be recruited to ER-target genes, suggesting that
ER ubiquitination and turnover occurs within short time frames at
the chromatin and this tight coupling could be a prerequisite for
subsequent rounds of transcription.
That the regulation of ERa stability and turnover is complicated
is evident from recent observations that other post-translational
modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation, SUMOylation and acetylation may crosstalk with ubiquitination.11,17 Additionally, it is
known that diverse ER-associated proteins can modulate ERa
stability or even trigger proteasomal degradation and turnover, as
demonstrated in the case of the oncogenic coactivator SRC3.18
Interestingly, ERa can be mono-ubiquitinated, which, unlike

poly-ubiquitination, does not trigger proteasomal degradation.19
However, the consequences of ERa mono-ubiquitination for its
stability and function in breast cancer cells, as well as for the
cellular factors that speciﬁcally trigger and recognize this type of
modiﬁcation, remain to be characterized.
Here, we identify the atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 (alias
HOIP and ZIBRA) as one such candidate factor. RNF31 was initially
cloned from breast cancer cells based on its elevated mRNA
expression,20 but its function in breast tumorigenesis and
estrogen signaling has not yet been addressed. Our study
characterizes a novel non-genomic mechanism that links RNF31
to the control of ERa ubiquitination and stability and thereby to
the transcriptional regulation of estrogen-dependent genes and
breast cancer cell proliferation.

RESULTS
RNF31 modulates E2-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer cells
To investigate the role of RNF31 in cell proliferation, we knocked
down endogenous RNF31 in the ERa-positive breast cancer cell
line MCF-7 using RNA interference (Figure 1a). We observed that
RNF31 depletion reduced E2-stimulated cell growth (Figure 1b)
and decreased E2-stimulated cell cycle progression (Figure 1c and
Supplementary Figure S1A). Importantly, RNF31 depletion reduced
the number of cells in the S phase to the same extent as the
depletion of ERa in E2-treated cells, which correlated with an
increase in the number of cells in the G0-G1 phase. Overexpression of ERa partially reversed the reduced number of cells in
the S phase following RNF31 depletion (Figure 1d and
Supplementary Figure S1B). The actual level of reversion is
difﬁcult to interpret as the conditions for small interfering
RNA (siRNA) transfection are different from those of plasmid

transfection and it is unlikely that all cells transfected with siRNA
are also transfected with plasmid. Together these data suggest
that ERa is a key mediator of the proliferative effects of RNF31 in
this ER-responsive cellular system. However, also in the absence of
E2 treatment (Figure 1c, vehicle), RNF31 depletion reduced the
number of cells in the S phase, whereas ERa depletion had no
effect under these conditions. Additionally, ERa depletion did not
mimic RNF31 depletion with regard to the percentage of cells in
the G0-G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle.
RNF31 depletion decreases ERa levels and modulates expression
of ERa target genes
We then addressed the functional consequences of RNF31
depletion on ERa signaling linked to proliferation control. Western
blot analysis revealed that RNF31 depletion signiﬁcantly downregulated protein levels of ERa in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2a).
Importantly, ERa downregulation was observed in a similar manner
in MDA-MB175 and T47D cells (Supplementary Figure S2A) and
could be achieved using two different individual siRNAs of the
siRNA pool (Supplementary Figure S2B). To determine whether
effects of RNF31 on ERa protein levels were correlated with effects
on ERa transcriptional activity, we assayed ERa reporter gene
activity following RNF31 depletion or overexpression. Figure 2b
shows that RNF31 depletion leads to reduced ERa reporter gene
expression, whereas RNF31 overexpression leads to increased
reporter gene expression in the presence and absence of estrogen.
RNF31 depletion also reduced the expression of endogenous ERa
target genes such as ADORA1, pS2 and Cyclin D1 (Figure 2c).
Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed decreased ERa binding to the promoter regions of target
genes following RNF31 depletion (Figure 2d). Supplementary
Figure 3A shows that inhibition of RNF31 does not affect the

endogenous expression of JUND and GAPDH, which were used as
negative controls. Furthermore, Supplementary Figure S3B shows
that inhibition of RNF31 effects ERa and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB)
signaling but not Liver X Receptor signaling in luciferase assays.
Additionally, Supplementary Figure S3C shows that the lack of
effect on Liver X Receptor signaling is independent of the presence
of ligand. Thus, the effect of RNF31 on cell signaling shows
pathway selectivity. The effect on the NF-kB pathway is not
surprising considering the established role of RNF31 in modulating
this pathway.21–23 Consistent with the well-known regulation by
ERa of its own expression,24 RNF31 depletion downregulated the
expression of ERa mRNA (Supplementary Figure S3D) and the
binding of ERa to the known ERa-binding site in the ERa promoter
(Figure 2d). Global gene expression analysis followed by subnetwork enrichment analysis revealed signiﬁcant regulation of ERa
signaling pathways by RNF31 (Table 1). In line with this, RNF31
affects a large number of ERa target genes, both those that
have been shown to be upregulated and those that have been
shown to be downregulated, in breast cancer cells (Figure 2e).
Thus, RNF31 constitutes a regulator of general ERa signaling and
its target genes.

RNF31 is highly expressed and is correlated to ERa target genes in
tumor samples
To begin to explore the clinical relevance of the effect of RNF31 on
proliferation and estrogen signaling, we analyzed primary breast
cancer samples and adjacent tissues for the expression of RNF31
mRNA. We observed high levels of RNF31 expression in tumor
tissue compared with adjacent tissues (Figure 3a). Next, we tested
known ERa target genes that were also identiﬁed as being
regulated by RNF31 in MCF-7 cells, for correlation with RNF31 in
publically available gene expression proﬁling data from 42000
breast cancer patients in the TCGA RNA-sequencing25 and
KMplot26 databases. Importantly, RNF31 expression correlates
with expression of about 70% of the known ERa target genes, in at
least one of the clinical gene proﬁling data sets, identiﬁed as being
regulated by RNF31 in MCF-7 cells (Table 2). This is exempliﬁed in
Figure 3b that shows that the expression of RNF31 positively
correlates with the expression of classical ERa target genes, such
as TFF1 (pS2) and GREB1 in clinical breast cancer samples. If
tumors were separated according to high or low RNF31
expression, a signiﬁcant correlation to the differential expression
of ERa target genes was observed, as further shown in Figure 3c.
RNF31 associates with ERa and increases its stability
Further support for the functional cooperation of RNF31 with
ERa was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of the
overexpressed proteins from HEK-293 cells (Supplementary
Figure S4A) and of the endogenous proteins from MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Figures S4B and C). Additionally,
overexpression of RNF31 upregulated ERa protein levels in MCF-7
cells under steady-state conditions (Figure 4b). Upon inhibition of
protein synthesis by cycloheximide, RNF31 depletion accelerated
ERa degradation and this effect was observed both in the

presence and absence of estrogen (Figures 4c and d). It is well
established that ERa regulates its own expression in MCF-7 cells,24
making it difﬁcult to distinguish direct effects of RNF31 on ERa
protein and mRNA levels in this cell line. We therefore performed
assays in HEK-293 cells, in which RNF31 but not ERa is expressed.
In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, ERa was
stabilized also in the absence of RNF31 and overexpression of
RNF31 did not further increase the stability of ERa (Figure 4e). In
summary, these data suggest that RNF31 increases ERa protein
stability via inhibition of its proteasome-dependent degradation.
The RBR domain of RNF31 is required for the association with, and
stabilizing effect on, ERa
To delineate the domains of RNF31 that are important for the
association with ERa, wild-type RNF31 and deletion variants
thereof (Figure 5a) were expressed together with ERa in HEK-293
cells. Co-IP revealed a requirement of the C-terminal ring between
ring ﬁngers (RBR) domain for association with ERa (Figure 5b). We
also overexpressed the same RNF31 variants in MCF-7 cells to
determine the effect on endogenous ERa. In line with the notion
that the RBR domain is required for RNF31 to associate with ERa, it
is also required for the regulation of ERa levels (Figure 5c). In
contrast, the ubiquitin-associated domain seems to be dispensable for associations with, and stabilization of, ERa. Finally,
estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase assays show that the
RBR region of RNF31 is required to increase transcriptiondependent ERa signaling in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5d).
RNF31, via its RBR domain, triggers ERa mono-ubiquitination
The requirement of the RNF31 RBR domain, implicated in
catalyzing atypical ubiquitination of substrates, led us to
investigate the consequences of RNF31 depletion or

overexpression on the ubiquitination status of ERa in HEK-293
cells and in MCF-7 cells. Western blot analysis of ERa in lysates
from HEK-293 cells overexpressing RNF31 and ERa revealed the
presence of potentially mono-ubiquitinated ERa species
(Figure 6a). Importantly, depletion of endogenous RNF31 lead to
reduced levels of mono-ubiquitinated ERa in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 6b). The higher-molecular weight ERa species were
reduced upon deletion of the RBR domain, whereas no change
was seen upon deletion of the ubiquitin-associated domain
(Figure 6c). More direct evidence that ERa was speciﬁcally subject
to modiﬁcation by ubiquitination was obtained by immunoprecipitation-based ubiquitination assays. Ubiquitinated species were
enriched using a ubiquitin antibody from HEK-293 cell extracts
overexpressing ERa together with RNF31 variants and analyzed by
western blots for the presence of ERa in the precipitates
(Figure 6d). The results conﬁrmed that RNF31 overexpression
increased the amounts of mono-ubiquitinated ERa. Consistent
with the important role of the RBR domain of RNF31 for its

association with, and stabilizing effect on, ERa, the presence of
mono-ubiquitinated ERa was dependent on the RBR domain of
RNF31 (Figure 6e). To further support the functional link between
mono-ubiquitination, stability and signaling by ERa, we used the
ubiquitin ligase-deﬁcient RNF31 mutant R1/2M, in which cysteine
residues required for the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates have
been mutated.27 We overexpressed the RNF31 R1/2M in MCF-7
cells to determine the effect on endogenous ERa and EREluciferase activity. Figures 7a and b show that R1/2M failed to
increase endogenous ERa protein levels and ERE-luciferase
activity. If co-transfected with ERa into HEK-293 cells, RNF31
R1/2M failed to induce mono-ubiquitination of ERa (Figures 7c
and d). Altogether, these data point at functional links between
the RNF31 ubiquitin ligase domain, ERa mono-ubiquitination and
ERa stabilization.
RNF31 and ERa co-occur mainly in the cytosol
RNF31 is known to be involved in diverse ubiquitination pathways
both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, but its intracellular
localization and action in relation to ER signaling in breast cancer
cells remained unclear. Immunocytochemistry revealed that
endogenous RNF31 is localized to the nuclear and cytosol
compartments of MCF-7 cells (Figure 8a, for quantiﬁcation see
Supplementary Figure S5). Furthermore, endogenous ERa and
RNF31 were found to be prevalent in the cytosol both in the
presence and absence of E2 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 8a), and a similar
protein distribution was seen with ectopically expressed proteins
in HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Figure S6). In MCF-7 cells,
treatment with E2 redistributed a signiﬁcant fraction of ERa to
the nucleus, whereas the RNF31 distribution remained unaffected.
Consistent with the immunocytochemistry results, co-IP assays
revealed that the association of RNF31 and ERa occurs mainly in
the cytosolic fraction (Figure 8b). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays failed to detect the recruitment of RNF31 to
ER-responsive genes in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure S7).
DISCUSSION
Here we report that the atyical ubiquitin ligase RNF31 associates
with, and stabilizes, ERa in breast cancer cells, leading to increased
estrogen signaling and cellular proliferation. Importantly, we also
observe correlations between RNF31 and ERa target gene
expression in breast cancer samples. Our study suggests a novel
non-genomic mechanism of ER stability control (see model
Figure 8c). On the basis of these data we propose that selective
modulation of RNF31 expression and/or functional cooperation
with ERa could be a strategy to inhibit proliferation in ERa-positive
breast cancers.
RNF31—a mediator of crosstalk between proliferative signaling
pathways in breast cancer cells
Our analysis of MCF-7 cell proliferation, in conjunction with siRNAmediated depletion of RNF31 or ERa, revealed a requirement of
RNF31 for breast cancer cell growth and speciﬁcally for E2stimulated cell cycle progression. This suggests that ERa is one of
the key mediators of the proliferative effects of RNF31 in ERapositive breast cancer cells. Indeed, unbiased pathway analysis of
the RNF31-dependent transcriptome, as determined by microarray
expression analysis in MCF-7 cells, conﬁrmed the functional link of
RNF31 to the estrogen-signaling pathway. Importantly, a functional link between RNF31 and the estrogen-signaling pathway
was also observed in breast cancer samples. In addition, the
analysis revealed links to the NFkB pathway, and to the p53
pathway, known for its key role in cell cycle control. In addition, a
previous study reported that RNF31 participates in transforming
growth factor b and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways,28 both of
which play fundamental roles in breast cancer. These pathways

may contribute to the ERa/E2-independent effects of RNF31
depletion, consistent with the observation that RNF31 is also
expressed in ERa-negative cell lines (data not shown).
Irrespective of the precise contribution of these additional
RNF31-regulated pathways, it is likely that they crosstalk with the
estrogen signaling pathway in ERa-positive cancers, instead of
acting independently. One intriguing candidate for such cross talk
is the NFkB signaling pathway, implicated in both inﬂammation
and oncogenesis in cancer cells.29,30 A number of recent studies
have demonstrated that RNF31, together with the linear ubiquitin
chain assembly complex (LUBAC) complex, is a critical component
of cytoplasmic NFkB activation cascades, in other cell types.21–23
However, a ﬁrst direct evidence for both positive and negative
crosstalk has been provided by studying tumor necrosis factor aactivation of the NFkB pathway, and its interference with ER
signaling, in breast cancer cell lines.29 Future studies of the
individual facets of this crosstalk with particular emphasis on the
RNF31 network should help to re-evaluate newly developed antiinﬂammatory ER ligands,29 along with attempts to target
components of the RNF31/NF-kB pathway.
The place of RNF31 within the atypical RBR family of E3 ubiquitin
ligases
Among the more than 700 putative E3 ubiquitin ligases in
humans, members of the RING-in between rings (IBR)-RING (RBR)
family have attracted recent attention due to their uncommon

ubiquitination mechanism and their regulatory signaling
functions.31 Unlike classic E3s, including RING and HECT ligases,
RBR ligases seem to preferentially catalyze mono-ubiquitination
or linear poly-ubiquitination of substrates, which does not lead
to substrate degradation and turnover.32,33 The very recent
clariﬁcation of the unique RBR ubiquitination mechanism in part
resolves the initial paradox that RBR ligases often stabilize
their substrates. Additionally, mechanisms of RBR-mediated
ubiquitination are often substrate-dependent.31,32 RBR ligases
appear therefore well suited to fulﬁll diverse regulatory roles in
intracellular signaling and transcription. This has perhaps best
been demonstrated in case of the Parkin protein (PARK2),
implicated in Parkinson disease, and in the case of PARC (CUL9)
which is implicated in p53 tumor suppression.34–37
There is a growing interest in the linear ubiquitin chain
assembly complex referred to as LUBAC, implicated in NFkB
signaling, and thus potentially in multiple disorders, such as
cancer and chronic inﬂammatory and metabolic diseases.21,22
Most notably, RNF31 functions as the main E3 ligase of LUBAC,
which contains additional subunits including RBCK1 and Sharpin.
Both RNF31 and RBCK1 function independently from each other,
and thus without the entire LUBAC complex, to modulate various
nuclear receptor pathways. For example, we have previously
demonstrated that RBCK1 inhibits cellular proliferation of ERapositive breast cancer cells via several genomic/transcriptional
mechanisms: RBCK1 regulates ERa gene transcription, and it acts
as a transcriptional cofactor that co-occupies E2-responsive

promoters.38 The combined data of our previous and current
studies suggest that RNF31 and RBCK1 affect ERa signaling by
very distinct mechanisms. Unlike RBCK1, RNF31 cannot be directly
recruited to ERa target promoters in MCF-7 cells, consistent with
the dominant cytoplasmic localization of RNF31 that we found.
RNF31 stabilizes ERa via a unique ubiquitination mechanism
In contrast to RBCK1, RNF31 appears speciﬁcally linked to the
control of ERa protein stability and mono-ubiquitination. This
mechanism of action is consistent with a previously reported and
similar role of RNF31 in stabilizing the steroidogenic orphan
receptor DAX-1.27 The obvious link between RNF31 and monoubiquitination explains why RNF31 action leads to substrate
stabilization instead of degradation, although some mechanistic
details remain unrevealed. On the basis of our experimental data,
the following two mechanisms are likely to contribute: (1) RNF31
mono-ubiquitinates ERa, either alone or in complex with yet
another E3 ligase. Importantly, RNF31 does not act in complex
with RBCK1/LUBAC, as deletion of the RNF31 ubiquitin-associated
domain, necessary for RBCK1 interaction, does not abolish monoubiquitination and stabilization of ERa (this study), or of DAX-1.27
However, the enzymatically intact RBR-type ubiquitin ligase
Oncogene (2014) 4340 – 4351

domain is necessary for these events, and its activity might be
further modiﬁed in a substrate (that is, ERa)-dependent manner.
(2) RNF31 stabilizes ERa by preventing poly-ubiquitination, which
may involve direct binding to mono-ubiquitinated ERa.
Intriguingly, RNF31 has several putative Zn-ﬁnger type ubiquitinbinding domains, whose functionality and speciﬁcity, due to the
lack of consensus signatures,27 remain to be determined.
RNF31—a candidate target for breast cancer diagnosis and
therapy?
What evidence supports the clinical relevance of our ﬁndings
about the role of RNF31 in estrogen signaling? Indeed, RNF31 was
originally discovered in screens for genes that were differentially
expressed in breast cancer cells compared with normal breast
epithelial cells.20 Consistent with this, using a limited number of
samples, we found that RNF31 is more highly expressed in breast
cancer tissues as compared with the surrounding normal tissues.
In addition, consistent with the expression of RNF31 mRNA in ERapositive breast cancer cell lines, RNF31 mRNA appears highly
expressed in ERa-positive breast tumor tissue. Importantly, the
notion that RNF31 is expressed in both ERa-positive and negative
cancers is not contradictory to our model but rather points at the

convergence of distinct signaling pathways toward proliferation
and tumorigenesis, as discussed above.
Given our data, it will be interesting but technically challenging
to determine whether high RNF31 protein levels in tumor samples
also cause a stabilization of ERa protein levels. Optimally, cancer
samples containing equal levels of ERa mRNA but different levels
of RNF31 (mRNA and protein) should be quantitated for ERa
protein. An additional complication arises from the fact that
functional associations between RNF31 and ERa occur mainly in
the cytoplasm, which will be more complicated to analyze by
immunohistochemistry than the nuclear fraction, traditionally
used to score for ERa positivity in clinical samples. These concerns
apply to monoclonal antibody-based biochemical methods as
well, as already noted in 1986.39 An interesting question is
therefore whether some tumors that were initially scored as ERnegative could be enriched in cytoplasmic receptors, and whether
this enrichment is dependent on cytoplasmic RNF31. Also relevant
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

is the recent observation that clinically used markers including
ERa, PR and HER2 protein levels are unstable throughout tumor
progression and possibly inﬂuenced by adjuvant therapy.9 As
alterations of both epigenetic/transcriptional (mRNA) and posttranslational (protein) mechanisms are likely to contribute to the
loss of ERa, post-translational ER regulators such as RNF31 have to
be taken into consideration as well. In light of these concerns, the
possible convergence of RNF31 and ER signaling in RNF31/ERapositive breast cancers should be of outmost interest for the
clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions and requires further
clariﬁcation.
In conclusion, although ERa has already been well documented
to have a critical role in the etiology and progression of breast
cancer, RNF31 emerges as a new component of ER signaling
in ERa-positive breast cancers. To identify novel therapeutic
strategies for treating ERa-positive breast cancers, modulation of
ERa levels is one feasible approach to inhibit estrogen signaling

RNF31 as a modulator of ERa protein levels in breast cancer cells,
RNF31 could constitute a valuable diagnostic tool and/or a drug
target for ERa-positive breast cancers.

Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 1C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. T47D and MDA-MB-175 cells were

pcDNA3-ERa plasmid, the ERE-TK-Luc reporter and the pRL-TK control have
been described previously.40
Oncogene (2014) 4340 – 4351

siRNA transfection
Cells were transfected with 50–100 nM siRNA. RNF31 siRNAs correspond
to the siGENOME SMARTpool RNF31 (Dharmacon D-0021419, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), consisting of four single
siRNAs, which were used in previous studies.27 ERa siRNA and control
siRNA were Stealth Select siRNA (Invitrogen). INTERFERin transfection
reagent (Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY, USA) was used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.

Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described.41 Primer
sequences for qPCR are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies used were anti-GAPDH (ab8425), antiRNF31 (ab46322) from Abcam, and anti-Myc (9E10), anti-ubiquitin (FL76),

performed with RNF31 antibody for precipitation and ERa antibody for detection (right panel). (c) Hypothetical model for the functional
interplay of RNF31 with ERa signaling in breast cancer cells. RNF31 associates with ERa predominantly in the cytoplasm and promotes monoubiquitination of ERa, thereby counteracting proteasome-mediated degradation. The so elevated ERa protein levels cause increased genomic
ERa signaling, for example, transcription of E2-target genes linked to the proliferation of breast cancer cells. RNF31, as part of the LUBAC
ubiquitin ligase complex, has an established independent function in NFkB signaling. To which extent the two signaling pathways also
crosstalk remains to be investigated.

Luciferase reporter assays

Protein stability assay

Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany).

MCF-7 cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNF31 or siControl. 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated with E2 or vehicle for 24 h. The cells were

the medium was changed into phenol red-free DMEM with 2% dextrancoated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum. After an additional 24 h, the cells
were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol for 30 min and stained by propidium iodide. The
BD LSR II ﬂow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used
to measure the ﬂow ﬂuorescence intensity. For the rescue experiment,
MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNF31 or siControl. After 24 h, the cells
