Abstract
Author Manuscript

Metastasis is the main cause of death from cancer. To colonize distant organs, circulating cancer
cells must overcome many obstacles through mechanisms that we are starting to understand.
Infiltrating distant tissue, evading immune defences, adapting to supportive niches, surviving as
latent tumour-initiating seeds, and eventually breaking out to replace the host tissue, are key steps
for metastatic colonization. These obstacles make metastasis a highly inefficient process, but once
metastases are established current treatments frequently fail to provide durable responses. A better
understanding of the mechanistic determinants of metastatic colonization is needed to better
prevent and treat metastatic cancer.

Malignant tumours start early on the road to metastasis. Cancer cells that are invasive and
motile can enter the circulation long before the tumour is diagnosed. Most of these cells
perish, but a small proportion manages to infiltrate and survive in distant organs as
disseminated seeds for eventual relapse. Thus, at diagnosis, a primary tumour may already
have seeded distant organs with thousands of cancer cells. These cells will continue to face
many barriers before they can overtake the host organ and form clinically relevant lesions.
Indeed, organ colonization is the most complex and rate-limiting phase of the metastatic
process.

Author Manuscript

Until recently, research on metastatic colonization was hindered by the complexity of the
biologic problem and a lack of adequate experimental models. However, the recent
development of patient-derived and genetically engineered mouse models of metastasis,
improved imaging technologies, advanced genomic sequencing, including the ability to
analyse single cells, and an improved access to clinically annotated tissue samples, has
brought new insights into the molecular mechanisms that allow circulating cancer cells to
invade distant organs, settle in supportive niches, and eventually overtake the host tissue
(Figure 1). This progress has allowed a better conceptualization of the metastatic process as

a whole and provided a basis for better treatments. Though only a start, these advances show
that elucidating metastatic colonization is a tractable problem with clinical benefits. The
aspects of metastatic colonization that we explore in this article are individually rich areas of
research, and we cite recent specialized reviews that cover each of these areas in depth.
Here, we highlight current concepts and open key questions at the forefront of this field.

The inefficiency of metastatic colonization

Author Manuscript

Even small tumours can release millions of cancer cells, yet many cancer patients never
relapse or do so after a long period of latency without clinically manifesting disease. The
number of cancer cells found in blood samples, called circulating tumour cells (CTCs), far
exceeds the number of overt metastatic lesions that develop1. Cancer cells that survive after
infiltrating distant organs, termed disseminated tumour cells (DTCs), can be present in the
bone marrow of cancer patients for years, and yet only about half of these patients develop
overt metastasis2. These clinical observations argue that metastatic colonization is a very
inefficient process, in which most cancer cells die, and only a minority of the surviving cells
forms macro-metastases.

Author Manuscript

Data from experimental mouse models is in line with the clinical evidence. Intravenously
injected cancer cells that reach the lungs die massively within two days3, as do arterially
injected cancer cells that lodge in the brain, liver, or bone marrow4. Even cell populations
that are enriched for highly metastatic cells suffer extensive attrition after infiltration of
distant organs5. The vast majority of melanoma cells injected in the portal vein failed to
form micrometastases in the liver, and only 0.02% formed macrometastases6,7. Similarly,
most cancer cells that infiltrate the brain die8–10. The inefficiency of metastasis cannot
simply be attributed to a scarcity of cancer stem cells with metastasis-initiating potential. A
majority of breast cancer stem cells that reach the lungs in mice undergo apoptosis11, and
colorectal cancer stem cells are cleared quickly after infiltrating the liver parenchyma12.
These observations in mouse models and in the clinic imply that factors influencing the
survival and tumour-initiating activity of DTCs are key determinants of metastasis.

Early colonization steps

Author Manuscript

The early steps in the metastatic cascade, including cancer cell invasion, migration, and
entry into the circulation, have been extensively studied13,14. Cytoskeletal rearrangements
within the cancer cells15, combined with the action of adhesive interactions, secreted
extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cathepsins16,17 drive cancer cell
invasion and migration through the stroma. Cancer cells may migrate as single cells boring a
path through extracellular matrix18, move along collagen fibers19, or migrate collectively as
ensembles that forge ahead from the tumour invasion front20.
In prostate cancer invasion along nerve fibers provides an additional route for
dissemination21. In response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and other stromal
signals, carcinoma cells may undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
reversible phenotypic change involving a loss of intercellular adhesion and epithelial
polarization and a gain of motility and invasiveness22. EMT is key in gastrulation and other

morphogenic events during development. In carcinoma cells, EMT can promote cell entry
into the vasculature, called intravasation, and support a stem cell phenotype, whereas a
reversal of this state after extravasation may facilitate organ colonization23. However, recent
studies suggest that EMT is dispensable for the establishment of metastasis in models of
breast and pancreatic cancer, although it contributes to the aggressiveness of cancer cells by
increasing their chemoresistance24,25. Thus the contribution of EMT to metastasis may be
more nuanced than previously thought.
Cancer cells may leave tumours as single cells or as cell clusters (Figure 1). Growing
evidence indicates that distinct cancer cell clones can show cooperative behaviour,
promoting mutual survival and metastatic ability26–29. Polyclonal metastatic seeding is, for
example, documented in prostate cancer patients30, and in experimental models polyclonal
CTC clusters establish metastases more efficiently than single cells31.

Author Manuscript

In the bloodstream cancer cells are exposed to significant shear forces, innate immunity, and
oxidative stress. To protect themselves during transit, cancer cells associate with platelets32
and undergo reversible metabolic changes to increase their ability to withstand oxidative
stress33. Melanoma cells show increased dependence on NADPH-generating enzymes in the
folate pathway and inhibition of this pathway reduced overt metastasis34. In support of this
finding, anti-oxidant supplementation increased lymph node metastases but had no effect on
the growth of primary tumours33,34.

Author Manuscript

Mechanical entrapment of CTCs in capillaries is considered the main mechanism for cancer
cell arrest prior to exit from blood into tissue. Circulation patterns dictate the first capillary
bed that CTCs will encounter. In most organs, the venous circulation leads to the right
cardiac ventricle and on to the lungs, whereas the mesenteric venous system from the gut
first drains into the liver. The resulting retention of CTCs in lungs or liver, respectively,
contributes to the high incidence of metastasis in these organs35. However, some CTCs
bypass these first filters, perhaps through larger arterio-venous shunts, to reach all other
organs through the arterial circulation.

Author Manuscript

CTCs lodged in the microvasculature may initiate intraluminal growth and form an embolus
that eventually ruptures the vessel36 or extravasate by breaching vascular walls5,6. The
composition of the vascular walls differs between organs and thus also influences where
cancer cells extravasate (Figure 1). The capillaries in the liver and bone marrow, called
sinusoids, are lined with fenestrated endothelial cells and a discontinuous basal lamina37,
gaps that may facilitate the extravasation of CTCs and contribute to the high incidence of
liver and bone metastasis13,38. In contrast, the endothelium of lung capillaries has tight
junctions and a basement membrane, and brain capillary walls are additionally reinforced by
pericytes and astrocyte processes, together constituting the blood-brain-barrier13,37. Diverse
genes have been identified that mediate breast cancer CTC extravasation in the lungs in
model systems and are associated with lung metastasis in the clinic. These mediators include
Fascin-1 and other components of invading protrusions called invadopodia39, autocrine
enhancers of cancer cell motility like epiregulin and WNT ligands39,40, mediators of
endothelial disjunction and vascular permeability including angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), MMP1, and

osteonectin41–44. CTC-associated platelets can stimulate extravasation by releasing TGF-β
and triggering an EMT in the cancer cells32 or by secreting adenine nucleotides, which relax
endothelial cell junctions45. Physical contacts with macrophages help pull CTCs across
capillary walls in the lungs46. Many of these factors also enhance CTC extravasation in the
brain, which additionally involves cancer-cell derived sialyltransferase ST6GalNac547,
cathepsin S48, and microRNAs mir-105 and mir-181c49,50. These mediators individually
provide a finite increase in the probability of metastatic seeding, and frequently act in
parallel. In sum, a combination of priming signals from the tumour stroma, CTC cluster
composition, circulation patterns, and cancer cell-autonomous functions determine
metastatic infiltration of specific organs.

Tissue defences against infiltrating cancer cells
Author Manuscript

Cancer cells develop in primary tumours under a co-evolving microenvironment that
suppresses immune surveillance17,51. However, this support is not immediately available to
the cancer cells as they infiltrate distant organs, and most of these cells die5–7. The “seed and
soil” hypothesis was based on the observation that different cancers show predilection for
metastasis in different organs, and envisioned that certain organs are more hospitable to
wandering cancer cells than others52. “Seed and soil” is an appealing metaphor, but it can be
misleading. To disseminated cancer cells every distant soil is deadly, though some soils may
be less deadly than others. In fact, the most welcoming of all soils for CTCs may be the
primary tumour itself. The preferential re-seeding of CTCs back to a primary or metastatic
tumour, over seeding tumour-free secondary sites, has been called tumour “self-seeding”53.
Self-seeding can amplify the most aggressive clones released by a tumour53 and disperse
drug resistant clones during treatment of metastatic melanoma with targeted therapy54.

Author Manuscript

While coping with a new and challenging microenvironment, newly disseminated cancer
cells may be particularly vulnerable to immune surveillance (Figure 1). Major players in
anti-metastatic immune surveillance include CD8 T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells55.
Depletion of cytotoxic T-cells or NK cells increases metastasis56,57 and inhibition of the
tyrosine kinase Mertk, a negative regulator of NK cells, suppresses metastasis58. Moreover,
the specific immune cell composition of an organ may influence the susceptibility of that
organ to overt metastasis. For example, the liver is particularly rich in NK cells, and
neutralization of the pro-apoptotic NK-derived factor TRAIL, or genetic depletion of NK
cells in mice, increases hepatic metastasis59,60. Recent advances in immunotherapy, most
prominently using immune checkpoint inhibitors, have yielded striking results against
metastatic melanoma and other tumours61,62. Thus, immunity is a major defence against
metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Other cell types can also mount a strong defence against metastatic infiltration. Astrocytes,
the most abundant cell type in the brain, reject extravasated cancer cells by releasing
plasminogen activator (PA). PA generates plasmin that mobilizes the pro-apoptotic cytokine
FasL to kill the infiltrated cancer cells. To avert this fate, brain metastatic cells from breast
and lung adenocarcinomas produce the PA inhibitors neuroserpin and serpin B29.

Supportive niches

Author Manuscript

Adult stem cells reside in specialized niches that provide cues to balance stem cell
proliferation versus quiescence, and self-renewal versus differentiation. Stem cell niches are
rich in developmental and self-renewal signals, such as hedgehog, Wnt, TGF-β family
members, and CXCL1263,64. Tumours are thought to arise from mutant stem cells in their
native niches or from cell progenies that retain tumour-initiating capacity and benefit from
these niche signals65–68. After cancer stem cells disperse to distant sites, their survival and
tumour-initiating potential may similarly benefit from interactions with specialized niches69
(Figure 2). Recent evidence suggests that prostate carcinoma stem cells occupy native
hematopoietic stem cell niches in the bone marrow70. Indeed, the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4
is a marker and mediator of breast cancer metastasis to CXCL12-rich bone marrow sites71.
Breast tumours that are rich in a CXCL12-secreting mesenchymal stroma select for
CXCL12 responsive cancer cell populations that are predisposed to survive in the bone
marrow72.
The space around small blood vessels is rich in supportive signals and can favour cancer
stem cell growth and resistance to therapy73,74. A striking case of metastatic cell interaction
with perivascular sites is observed in brain metastasis by breast cancer, lung cancer and
melanoma, in which the extravasated cells remain closely associated with capillaries8,75. The
cells spread on the basal lamina surrounding the capillaries and proliferate forming a sheath
that eventually engulfs and remodels the coopted capillary network, a process mediated by
expression of the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM in the metastatic cells9.

Author Manuscript

DTCs may set an ad-hoc niche by producing stem cell niche components themselves (Figure
2). Lung metastatic breast cancer cells produce the extracellular matrix protein tenascin C,
which is deposited in the incipient colony to amplify Notch and Wnt signaling in the cancer
cells76. Breast cancer stem cells may also secrete TGF-β, which stimulates stromal
fibroblasts to produce periostin, a binding partner of tenascin C that recruits Wnt factors11.
Cancer cell secretion of collagen crosslinking enzymes LOX and PLOD2, which stiffen the
extracellular matrix, amplifies integrin/focal adhesion signalling, also favouring
metastasis77–79.

Author Manuscript

Studies in experimental models have provided evidence that systemic signals from primary
tumours can impact the microenvironment of distant organs, creating ‘pre-metastatic niches’
prior to the arrival of CTCs80,81 (Figure 2). Different classes of systemic mediators, such as
tumour-derived inflammatory cytokines, exosomes, and extracellular matrix remodelling
enzymes have been shown in breast, lung, and gastrointestinal tumour models to recruit bone
marrow derived cells and pre-condition the lung, liver or bone marrow for infiltrating cancer
cells82–85. For example, tumour derived PIGF acts on cells in the lung parenchyma to upregulate chemotactic proteins, activate MMPs, and mobilize bone marrow derived
VEGFR1+ cells that increase the survival of infiltrating cancer cells80. Melanoma cells
secrete exosomes to induce vascular leakiness, inflammation, and bone marrow progenitor
cell recruitment during pre-metastatic niche formation86. Similarly, macrophage inhibitory
factor (MIF) containing exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells increase liver metastasis by
inducing TGF-β secretion, stimulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells and

the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the liver83. Recently it has been suggested
that integrins can target exosomes to specific organs to unload their cargo and prepare the
organ for the arrival of tumour cells87, thereby contributing to the organotropism of
metastasis.
Observations from the clinic raise questions about how pre-metastatic niches would play out
in cancer patients. Most cancer patients develop metastasis months to years after removal of
the primary tumour, during which time tumour cells remain largely dormant. Yet premetastatic niches, as defined in experimental models, support the immediate outgrowth of
disseminated cancer cells that reach the niche. Research will have to address whether premetastatic niches remain primed for years after the removal of a primary tumour or,
alternatively, whether the role of pre-metastatic niches is to enhance the survival of
infiltrating cells to increase their numbers before entering a latent state.

Growth and survival pathways

Author Manuscript

Acting in specific niches or in undefined spots, a plethora of genes and signals support
metastatic cell growth and survival in experimental models, and expression of these genes
predicts relapse in the clinic (see also Box1, Origin of metastatic traits). Many of these prometastatic stromal mediators ultimately activate stem cell support pathways (Wnt, TGF-β,
BMP, Notch, Stat3), pathways that integrate cell metabolism and survival (PI3K/AKT,
MAPK, HIF), positional and mechanical pathways (Hedgehog, Hippo), and inflammatory
pathways (NFkB, Stat1)69. These pathways also drive development and tissue regeneration,
but what is distinctive in the case of metastasis are the strategies that cancer cells employ to
ensure sufficient pathway activation in microenvironments with low levels of activating
signals (Figure 3). DTCs seem to be selected for the ability to optimize whatever cues the
host tissue offers.

Author Manuscript

Metastatic cells may achieve stimulation of these pathways by expressing autocrine pathway
activators or recruiting stromal cells that produce them (Figure 3). In both cases, the prometastatic signal may act by directly stimulating a vital pathway or by amplifying the
pathways’ signalling output69. For example, Stat3 stimulation by autocrine IL6 mediates
metastasis in prostate, and PI3K/AKT stimulation by autocrine IGF2 mediates metastasis in
esophageal cancer cells88,89. The intracellular tyrosine kinase Src amplifies the ability of
stromal CXCL12 to activate PI3K/AKT signalling in breast cancer cells that infiltrate the
bone marrow90. Breast cancer cells produce CSF-1 to recruit tumour-associated
macrophages as a source of EGF91 or CXCL1 to recruit myeloid precursors as a source of
S100A8/9 for MAPK activation92. Colorectal cancer stem cells that reach the liver express
TGF-β to recruit mesenchymal cells as a source of interleukin-11 (IL-11) for Stat3 activation
in the cancer cells12.
Cancer cells may also obtain vital support through contacts with stromal cells (Figure 3).
Claudin-2 mediated cell-cell interactions, between breast cancer cells and hepatocytes,
induce c-Met signalling and stimulate metastasis to the liver93. Membrane VCAM-1
expressed on breast cancer cells that infiltrate the lungs contacts α4 integrins on stromal
monocytes and macrophages to activate PI3K/AKT signalling in the cancer cells94. In

contrast, VCAM-1 in breast cancer cells that exit from dormancy in the bone marrow
contacts α4 integrins on monocytic precursors to accelerate the differentiation of these cells
into osteoclasts that mediate osteolytic metastasis95.
The activity of pro-metastatic pathways may also be increased by epigenetic alterations that
expand the range of a pathway’s gene responses. For example, VHL-mutant renal cell
carcinoma cells gain metastatic activity in multiple organs by DNA methylation and histone
acetylation changes that expand the range of HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) target genes, the
dominant oncogenic pathway in these cells96. Additional inputs come from the expression of
microRNAs that either promote or suppress metastasis by regulating multiple mediators of
tumour-stroma interactions97–100. These examples show that DTCs resort to diverse
mechanisms to procure vital inputs for survival and retention of tumour initiating capacity.

Author Manuscript

Exactly when, where, and how cancer cells resort to these various stromal cues is unclear.
Are these niches and pathways important for all stages of metastatic colonization, all the
time? Some might be critical only after extravasation, when cancer cells are challenged by
tissue defences, or during the latent phase of metastasis, when cancer cells must subsist for
years without outgrowth. Yet others might count only for outgrowth as DTCs that exit
dormancy. Such questions remain unanswered because most experimental models of
metastasis do not incorporate a latency phase. This gap in knowledge is also of concern from
a translational perspective. Treating overt metastasis by targeting a survival mechanism that
was relevant only during the initial infiltration of distant organs may have no clinical benefit,
and targeting a driver oncogenic pathway in latent DTCs may likewise be futile, whereas
targeting what supports the viability of latent DTCs could effectively eradicate residual
disease.

Author Manuscript

Latent metastasis
The clinical observation that patients relapse with metastatic disease months to years after
removal of the primary tumour, combined with the detection of DTCs in the bone marrow of
patients with no evidence of metastatic disease, proves that cancer cells disseminated before
treatment of the primary tumour remain competent to re-initiate metastatic growth long
thereafter. Some organs are more permissive than others for the accumulation of latent
DTCs. For example, patients with colorectal or gastric cancer may harbour DTCs in the
bone marrow, yet the incidence of bone metastasis in these patients is low101. The incidence
of DTCs in the bone marrow predicts not only for bone metastasis, but also for metastasis to
liver, lung and brain2.

Author Manuscript

Tumour dormancy is thought to occur in two modes (Figure 1). Cellular dormancy involves
isolated DTCs that enter a state of proliferative quiescence. Indeed, in patient bone marrow
samples most DTCs are found as quiescent single cells101–103. In contrast, tumour mass
dormancy involves micrometastases that cease to grow due to insufficient vascularization or
to constant culling by immune defences102. What dormancy mode most frequently leads to
overt metastases is uncertain.

Author Manuscript

Despite the biological and clinical relevance of metastatic latency, little is known about how
cancer cells enter the dormant state, what signals sustain it, what niches dormant cancer cells
inhabit, and what triggers the resumption of aggressive growth. The paucity of experimental
model systems that incorporate a latent phase, and the cost of studying a process over
extended periods in animal models, have hindered progress. However, recent work has
identified stromal signals that impose tumour dormancy in mouse xenograft models. TGF-β
and BMPs (bone morphogenetic proteins, members of the TGF-β family) can enforce
quiescence and inhibit self-renewal of carcinoma DTCs104–106. The perivascular niche has
also been implicated in the induction of cancer cell dormancy107. In contrast, environments
that are rich in type 1 collagen108 or fibronectin109 inhibit dormancy.

Author Manuscript

A scarcity of stromal growth factors and an abundance of growth-inhibitory signals can
favour metastatic dormancy in experimental models. Alone, however, these signals may not
sustain metastatic latency in the long-term. The tissues hosting DTCs, such as the lungs,
liver, or bone marrow, are not in a perpetual state of growth inhibition. On the contrary, these
tissues support cell proliferation as part of normal tissue homeostasis and regeneration. This
context would regularly stimulate DTCs to enter the cell cycle. Cancer cell-autonomous
mechanisms that self-impose quiescence in DTCs may be necessary. It is also not clear how
a continuously quiescent DTC population could evolve and acquire the necessary traits for
overt metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Evidence that DTCs are kept latent by the immune system comes from cancer transmission
in organ transplantation cases. Kidney, liver, and lung transplants from donors who were
cured of melanoma, or who suffered glioblastoma, which is generally considered a nonmetastatic tumour, transmitted donor-derived tumour in immunosuppressed recipients110,111.
These cases suggest that DTCs are maintained in the latent state by constant pressure from
the immune system. Perhaps DTCs intermittently enter the cell cycle and their progeny
undergo rapid elimination by the immune system, all the while evolving to acquire traits for
eventual metastatic outbreak.

Overt metastasis

Author Manuscript

Breaking through growth inhibitory or immune barriers might be sufficient for the initiation
of aggressive metastatic outgrowth in some organs. However, organs markedly differ in
tissue structure and composition, and their overt colonization involves distinct organ-specific
metastatic traits112. This translates into a remarkable variation of metastasis distribution
patterns depending on the tumour type. For example, prostate cancer has a marked
propensity to relapse in bone, uveal melanoma in the liver, and sarcomas in the lungs. In
contrast, melanomas, breast carcinomas, and lung adenocarcinomas tend to relapse in
multiple organs. The kinetics of relapse also varies. For example, lung cancer frequently
relapses in brain and other sites early, whereas brain relapse is typically a late event in
metastatic breast cancer. Certain oncogenic mutations appear to affect metastatic tropism.
For example, KRAS-mutant colon cancer secondarily colonizes the lungs from established
liver metastases113.

Author Manuscript

Bone metastasis is the best-understood case of overt colonization, and offers clear examples
of the nature of organ-specific metastasis traits that determine this final stage of the
metastatic process (Figure 3). Osteolytic bone metastasis results from an altered balance of
bone generating osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts, in favour of the latter. Numerous
mediators of osteoclast activation have been implicated in this process114. Cancer cellderived parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), IL-11, and tumour necrosis factor α
(TNF-α) cue osteoblasts to release RANKL, which stimulates osteoclast maturation114–116.
Bone metastatic cells also produce MMPs, which increase RANKL activity117 and reduce
the levels of the RANKL antagonist osteoprotegrin118. Expression of the Notch ligand
Jagged1 and cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and sICAM-1 also contribute to osteoclast
mobilisation95,119,120. Bone matrix degradation by the hyperactivated osteoclasts releases
TGF-β, which in turn augments the production of PTHrP, IL-11 and Jagged1 in the cancer
cells, driving a vicious cycle of bone destruction114–116.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, prostate cancer cells metastatic to bone alter the homeostatic balance in favour
of osteoblastic activity, stimulating bone matrix deposition with eventual displacement of the
bone marrow. Cancer-cell factors implicated in osteoblastic metastasis include fibroblast,
insulin-like and vascular endothelial growth factors (FGFs, IGFs, VEGF), as well as
endothelin 1, Wnt factors and BMPs114. Thus, bone metastasis provides a compelling
example of how cancer cells engage the host microenvironment in overt metastasis. Specific
stromal components may similarly be engaged in other organs by metastatic cells with the
necessary organ-specific colonization traits. For example, in the case of brain metastasis of
breast and lung carcinomas, the cancer cells can profitably engage astrocytes and microglia
through the expression of endothelin-1121. However, our knowledge of overt colonization
traits specific for organs other than bone is woefully limited and needs further investigation.

Author Manuscript

In certain subsets of patients metastasis is mainly confined to a particular organ that resists
therapy better than others. A prime example is the current rise in the incidence of late brain
and leptomeningeal metastasis in HER2+ breast cancer patients. These patients benefit from
advances in targeted therapies that suppress extracranial metastasis. However, this success is
short lived in many cases, owing to the eventual emergence of brain metastasis. Brain
metastasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with an overall incidence ten-fold
higher than that of all primary brain tumours combined, and it has few therapeutic options.
A better understanding of its underlying mechanisms is urgently needed.

After therapy
Author Manuscript

The surgical removal of a malignant tumour is often complemented with radiotherapy and
systemic adjuvant chemotherapy to suppress relapse. If metastasis becomes clinically
manifest, most systemic treatments target metastasis irrespective of organ site. Treatments
include classical chemotherapy, targeted therapy against oncogenic drivers,
immunotherapeutic agents that leverage the antitumour power of the immune system, and
increasingly, a combination of all of the above. Treatments that target metastasis in a
particular organ, by taking aim at cancer cell interactions with the host tissue, would be
indicated when metastasis is confined to that organ, as is the case with bone metastasis in
some breast cancer patients. A meta-analysis suggests that adjuvant therapy with osteoclast

inhibitory bisphosphonates suppresses bone metastasis and prolongs survival in
postmenopausal women122. Denosumab, an antibody that targets RANKL, reduces the
incidence of bone fractures associated with metastasis in patients receiving aromatase
inhibitors123.
In spite of these advances, current therapies frequently achieve only partial tumour
shrinkage, leaving behind substantial residual disease. Continued treatment may keep the
residual tumour indolent for some time. However, from the residual cancer cell population,
drug-resistant clones eventually emerge that drive rapid relapse124,125. As a result, cure rates
of patients with metastasis remain disappointingly low.

Author Manuscript

Current research has begun to focus on the biology of residual metastatic cells after therapy,
with the aim of better suppressing its re-emergence (Figure 4). The cancer cell population
may resist treatment through alterations of negative feedback signalling loops126 and
supportive interactions with the tumour microenvironment. For example, DNA damaging
agents induce the secretion of trophic factors including IL-6 and Timp-1 in normal cells of
the thymus, creating a chemoprotective niche for the survival of residual cancer cells and
eventual relapse127. Similarly, stromal fibroblasts secrete Wnt16b in response to
chemotherapy, promoting therapy resistance in prostate cancer128. Chemotherapy induces
the expression of TNF-α in tumour associated endothelial and mesenchymal cells,
amplifying the expression of the pro-metastatic cytokine CXCL1 in cancer cells92. In
BRAF-mutant melanomas treated with RAF inhibitors, tumour-associated macrophages
secrete TNF-α and VEGF129,130 and tumour-associated fibroblasts secrete HGF131, which
protect the cancer cells and limit the effectiveness of therapy.

Author Manuscript

Under the stress of therapy, the cancer cells themselves can be a source of survival
signals54,132,133. Targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors against melanoma
(vemurafenib, dabrafenib) or lung adenocarcinoma (erlotinib, crizotinib) triggers the
production of a complex secretome (“therapy-induced secretome”) that activates multiple
survival pathways in the remaining, drug-sensitive cancer cells54. Furthermore, this
secretome can stimulate the selective outgrowth of drug resistant clones, their dissemination,
and further metastatic reseeding. Collectively, these findings reveal a complex biology of
cancer cell populations that remain after the treatment of metastatic tumours, finally
contributing to tumour relapse.

Future Directions

Author Manuscript

An important target of future research is the identification of mediators of metastasis that are
common to different organ sites and tumour types. Although the topic of organ-specific
metastasis has intrigued researchers for over a century, the reality is that many patients suffer
from, or are at risk of metastasis in multiple organs. For these cases, identifying common
mediators of metastatic colonization as therapeutic targets would be of value. For example,
current checkpoint immunotherapy and its encouraging clinical success are based on the
premise that immune evasion is a shared feature of metastatic disease irrespective of organ
site. More knowledge on common mediators of metastatic colonization and regrowth after
therapy would provide clues for the improved elimination of residual disease.

The advent of single-cell analysis techniques, in particular single cell RNA sequencing and
signalling pathway profiling, is allowing functional and phenotypic analysis of
heterogeneous cell populations with unprecedented detail134–137. The application of these
techniques to residual disease and overt metastases will allow a better definition of tumour
heterogeneity, cell population structure and evolution, cell type-specific response patterns to
stromal cues and therapeutic agents, and other parameters at a level never before possible.
Furthermore, the ability to analyse circulating tumour DNA in the blood of cancer patients
will allow the monitoring of therapy responses, the emergence of distinct resistant clones,
and the patterns of early disease recurrence.

Author Manuscript

In the end, preventing metastasis in high-risk patients would be far better than having to treat
it later. The systemic nature of metastatic disease, the heterogeneity of metastatic tumours,
the multitude of genes and pathways involved in different organs, and the many mechanisms
of drug resistance, paint a sobering picture of the problem and prospects of addressing overt
metastatic disease. Prevention of relapse ostensibly is the goal of systemic therapy delivered
after the removal of a primary tumour. However, most agents used in the adjuvant therapy
setting target growing cancer cells, not quiescent DTCs that predominate during metastatic
latency. A better understanding of the basis for metastatic colonization, in particular of its
latent phase, is therefore needed in order to develop better treatments. Research on the
mechanisms that support the viability of latent metastatic cells should yield clues for
targeting residual disease with the goal of preventing metastasis.

Origin of metastatic traits

Author Manuscript

Metastasis develops through genetic and epigenetic changes and the subsequent selection
for favourable traits under the pressure of successive bottlenecks138,139. Genomic
comparisons show close clonal relationships between primary tumours and their
metastases. Specific ancestors of metastatic clones can often be identified in the primary
tumour30,139,140, supporting the hypothesis that late a clonal expansion in the primary
tumour gives rise to metastasis competent clones. These studies also provide evidence for
metastases seeding new metastases30. Disseminated cancer cells remain dependent on the
oncogenic mutations that underlie the primary tumour, providing a basis for treating
metastasis with drugs that target these oncogenic drivers125. In line with this observation,
gains in oncogenic mutant alleles occur in metastases, including gains in mutant KRAS
in pancreatic cancer metastasis141, and TP53 and androgen receptor mutations in prostate
cancer metastasis142. To date, however, no recurrent metastasis-specific mutations have
been identified, suggesting that epigenetic alterations and other sources of modified gene
expression are the predominant source of selectable pro-metastatic traits during clonal
evolution in metastasis139,140.

Author Manuscript

The cell-autonomous traits that favour cancer cell dissemination, resistance in circulation,
extravasation, and initial survival in distant organs matter immediately after cancer cells
depart from the primary tumour, and are pre-selected in the primary tumour. For example,
certain mediators of neoangiogenesis in breast tumours, including COX2, epiregulin,
MMP1, and VEGF are repurposed by cancer cells for extravasation in the lungs and
brain42,47,143. Stromal TGF-β in the triple-negative subset of breast carcinomas induces
expression of ANGPTL4 in cancer cells, thus priming these cells for extravasation in the
lungs41. These early metastatic traits may be selected under the stresses of tissue
invasion, immune surveillance, or hypoxia. The evidence favours a model in which a
significant proportion of cancer cells in a primary tumour acquire pro-metastatic traits
that confer a finite probability of success in the early steps of metastasis. Clones with the
most effective combination of pro-metastatic traits stand the highest probability of giving
rise to metastatic lesions, and also to re-seeding the primary tumour. Beyond these early
steps, cancer cells continue to evolve after dissemination to distant organs, acquiring
traits for overt colonization as suggested by the case of bone metastasis114. Cells that
disseminate early from a tumour could evolve in parallel with, but independently from
the primary tumour144. The origin of metastatic traits remains a fertile area for future
research.

Figure 1. Metastatic colonization steps

Author Manuscript

Metastasis proceeds through multiple steps and restrictive bottlenecks. Factors including the
germline, tumour cell of origin, cancer cell plasticity, host tissue stroma, and response to
therapy may influence the emergence of metastatic traits, and the probability that a cancer
cell will complete all the steps towards overt metastasis. The pre-colonization phase of
metastasis involves a series of events that cancer cells go through in a time scale of minutes
to hours, including: (1) local invasion of cancer cells in the primary tumour, (2) intravasation
into the tumour vasculature, (3) circulation of cancer cells as single cells or cell clusters,
coated with platelets, (4) arrest in capillaries at the distant site and, (5) extravasation into the
parenchyma of target organs for metastatic colonization. Colonization can be parsed into
many steps that occur in a time scale of years. After extravasation, metastatic colonization
comprises (6) resistance to immunity and other host tissue defences, (7) settlement in
supportive niches for survival and retention of stem-like tumour-initiating capacity, (8) entry

into latency as single cells, or (9) as indolent micrometastases. During the latency phase,
which can last from months to decades, disseminated cancer cells must achieve long-term
survival and may acquire traits for the eventually overtaking of the host tissue. The
disseminated cancer cells may then break out of latency, reinitiating overt outgrowth (10),
and overtaking the local tissue microenvironment (11). Once metastases become clinically
manifest, therapeutic treatment may partially eliminate the tumour (12). However, under
therapy-induced stress, cancer cells and non-neoplastic stromal cells mobilize survival
signals (13) that nurse the residual disease until minority drug-resistant clones emerge and
lead the outgrowth of a drug-resistant tumour (14). Different host tissue microenvironments
select for cancer cells with distinct metastatic traits, giving rise to organ-specific metastatic
cell populations.

Figure 2. Metastatic niches

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells that infiltrate distant tissues survive and retain stem cell potential by situating in
supportive niches, akin to the niches that support normal adult stem cells. Different niches
have been proposed: (1) pre-metastatic niches formed by systemic signals from the primary
tumour that recruit supportive stromal cells before the arrival of cancer cells from the
tumour; (2) perivascular niches for cancer cells that spread over the capillary basement
membrane right after extravasation, remaining in close apposition to endothelial cells and
their paracrine factors; (3) ad-hoc niches constituted by secretory products from the cancer
cells themselves that act in an autocrine manner or recruit stromal components as sources of
supportive signals; and (4), native stem cell niches of the host tissue, which are invaded by
the infiltrated cancer cells to directly occupy a supportive microenvironment. The four
entities may be partly overlapping in location or composition. For example, native stem cell
niches could be perivascular, or pre-metastatic signals might combine with ad-hoc niches.

Figure 3. Growth and survival pathway activation by disseminated cancer cells

Author Manuscript

During one or more stages of the metastatic colonization process, metastasis-initiating cells
require the activity of a common set of pathways that support the growth and survival of
stem and progenitor cells. After infiltrating distant tissues that offer limiting levels of
pathway activators, the disseminated cancer cells secure pathway activation through
autocrine or paracrine mediators that directly activate these pathways (1), or amplify the
responsiveness of the pathways to low levels of stromal activators (2, 3). Cancer cells may
express autocrine (1, 2) and intracellular (3) pathway activators and amplifiers. Cancer cells
may also express paracrine factors (4) that recruit stromal cells as sources of soluble
activators and amplifiers, or may achieve pathway activation through direct cell-cell contact.
Specific examples of these various mediators are listed in the figure and discussed in the
text.

Figure 4. Metastasis biology before and after cancer therapy: A model

Author Manuscript

Latent metastasis results from conditions that preserve the survival and tumour-initiating
ability of disseminated cancer cells. Eliminating latent metastasis by targeting these survival
mechanisms would prevent metastasis. Once cancer cells break out of the latency state and
form manifest metastasis, the condition is treated with combinations of conventional
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy. The treatment may dramatically
reduce the metastatic burden, but tumour elimination is frequently incomplete. Significant
segments of the tumour cell population withstand treatment by adaptation of their
intracellular pathways or activation of supportive paracrine inputs. Under the stress of
targeted therapy, drug-sensitive cancer cells express a large number of secreted factors
(therapy-induced secretome) that salvage drug-sensitive cells and accelerate the growth of
minority drug-resistant clones. The accelerated growth leads drug-resistant clones to drive

cancer cells under treatment might resemble those utilized by their predecessors during the
latent phase before overt colonization in this model.
