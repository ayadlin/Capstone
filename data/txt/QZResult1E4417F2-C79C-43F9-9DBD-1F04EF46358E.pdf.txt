ABSTRACT
Inappropriate activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays
a causal role in many cancers including colon cancer. The activation of EGFR by
phosphorylation is balanced by receptor kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase
activities. However, the mechanisms of negative EGFR regulation by tyrosine
phosphatases remain largely unexplored. Our previous results indicate that protein
tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is down-regulated in a subset of
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a poor prognosis. Here we identified PTPRO
as a phosphatase that negatively regulates SRC by directly dephosphorylating Y416
phosphorylation site. SRC activation triggered by PTPRO down-regulation induces
phosphorylation of both EGFR at Y845 and the c-CBL ubiquitin ligase at Y731.
Increased EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 promotes its receptor activity, whereas
enhanced phosphorylation of c-CBL triggers its degradation promoting EGFR stability.
Importantly, hyperactivation of SRC/EGFR signaling triggered by loss of PTPRO leads
to high resistance of colon cancer to EGFR inhibitors. Our results not only highlight
the PTPRO contribution in negative regulation of SRC/EGFR signaling but also suggest
that tumors with low PTPRO expression may be therapeutically targetable by antiSRC therapies.

in vertebrates EGFR signaling controls organogenesis of
multiple epithelial tissues [1, 2]. EGFR hyperactivation is
commonly observed in multiple types of epithelial cancers
including colon cancer [3]. Multiple mechanisms of EGFR
up-regulation, including amplification and activating
mutations of the EGFR gene as well as overexpression
of EGFR and the receptor ligands, are well-characterized.
More recent studies also highlight the importance

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a
crucial role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis in both
vertebrates and invertebrates by coordinating cell growth
and proliferation. In C. elegans and Drosophila, the EGFR
pathway controls the development of vulva and several
other organs at different stages of embryogenesis, whereas

of negative regulation in control of EGFR signaling
[4]. Nonetheless, the contributions of negative EGFR
regulators are still underestimated, although understanding
of their activities might form the foundation for a more
effective anti-cancer approach.
Genetic screens in C. elegans have identified several
negative regulators of EGFR including the E3 ubiquitin
ligase SLI-1 (c-CBL) and the tyrosine phosphatase
SCC-1, a R3 subtype of receptor-type protein tyrosine
phosphatases (RPTPs) [5]. The Drosophila orthologs of
R3 family members, Ptp4E and Ptp10D, have also been
shown to negatively regulate EGFR signaling [6, 7].
Loss of both Ptp4E and Ptp10D results in large bubblelike cysts in tracheal branches, a phenotype commonly
observed due to EGFR hyperactivation [7].
In vertebrates RPTPs of the R3 subtype include
vascular endothelial–protein tyrosine phosphatase
(VE-PTP), density-enriched PTP–1 (DEP-1), PTPRO
(GLEPP1), and stomach cancer–associated protein
tyrosine phosphatase–1 (SAP-1). All of these enzymes
share a similar structure with a single catalytic domain
in the cytoplasmic region and fibronectin type III–like
domains in the extracellular region [8]. Recent studies
have revealed additional common features of these R3subtype RPTPs. For instance, all members of the R3
family undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in their COOHterminal region, and such phosphorylation promotes the
binding of SRC family kinases (SFKs) [9]. Their striking
structural and sequence similarity suggests that they might
function through a common mechanism [10]. In fact, recent
unbiased siRNA screen targeting each of known tyrosine
phosphatases identified two R3 family members, DEP-1
and PTPRO, as negative EGFR regulators in human cells
[11]. DEP-1 has been shown to directly dephosphorylate
and thereby stabilize EGFR by hampering its ability to
associate with the c-CBL ubiquitin ligase. PTPRO has
also been identified among the top hits and proposed to
contribute to regulation of EGFR signaling. However, no
further functional validations have been performed in this
study [11].
Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab
and panitumumab) and small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) have been recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous-cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, and pancreatic cancer
[12, 13]. Despite their highly promising activity of EGFR
inhibitors for cancer treatment, there is a large group of
CRC patients that do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy.
The most well-established mechanism of cetuximab
resistance in CRC patients is oncogenic KRAS mutations.
However, not all patients harboring WT-KRAS benefit from
cetuximab treatment. There is accumulating evidence that
resistance to anti-EGFR therapy develops due to the loss
of negative regulators of EGFR signaling [4, 13].

To date, only few data have been published about
the contribution of PTPRO in colon cancer. Recent gene
expression analysis of 688 primary colon tumors revealed
that PTPRO mRNA expression is strongly down-regulated
in colon cancer patients with a poor prognosis [14]. In the
present study, we found that loss of PTPRO expression
is associated with increased resistance to EGFR
inhibition and identified PTPRO as a novel negative
regulator of EGFR signaling that functions through direct
dephosphorylation of the SRC kinase.

RESULTS
PTPRO controls EGFR stability and
phosphorylation at Y845
A recent high-throughput siRNA screen suggested
that PTPRO may be implicated in the regulation of
EGFR signaling [11]. To elucidate the role of PTPRO in
modulation of EGFR signaling, we assessed how PTPRO
overexpression affects EGF-induced phosphorylation
of several EGFR family members using The RayBio®
EGFR Phosphorylation Antibody Array. In accordance to
a recent report showing that ErbB2 is a direct substrate
of PTPRO [15], we found that PTPRO overexpression
in HEK293T cells diminished phosphorylation of
ErbB2 at Y1112 upon EGF stimulation (Figure 1A). In
addition to decreased phosphorylation of ErbB2 at Y1112,
PTPRO overexpression also led to decreased EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845 (Figure 1A). We observed
similar results when we overexpressed WT-PTPRO in
CACO2 colon cancer cell line, which does not express
PTPRO (Figure 1B). In contrast, suppression of PTPRO
in LIM1215 cells, which have high levels of PTPRO
expression, resulted in increased EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845 (Figure 1C). We were not able to detect EGFmediated phosphorylation of other EGFR sites (Y992,
Y1045, Y1068, Y1148, and Y1173) that were present on
The RayBio® EGFR Phosphorylation Antibody Array
(Figure 1A, B, and C).
To confirm the Antibody Array analysis, we assessed
how PTPRO affects the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845 upon EGF stimulation. We found that EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845 was up-regulated in EGFdependent manner in HEK293T cells expressing either
an empty vector or WT-PTPRO. However, PTPRO
overexpression led to more transient and decreased Y845phosphorylation of EGFR (Figure 1D). We also observed
a dramatic decrease of EGFR phosphorylation at Y845
upon EGF stimulation after WT-PTPRO overexpression
in CACO2 cells (Figure 1E). In contrast, suppression of
PTPRO expression in LIM1215 cells resulted in increased
levels of EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 in response
to EGF stimulation (Figure 1F). These results strongly
indicate that PTPRO regulates EGFR phosphorylation at
Y845.

We also found that PTPRO suppression inhibits
down-regulation of EGFR expression triggered by EGF
stimulation (Figure 1G). In addition, flow cytometry analysis
revealed that PTPRO knockdown led to the increased
EGFR levels on the plasma membrane (Figure 1H). Taken
together, our data strongly indicate a crucial role of PTPRO
in negative regulation of EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 as
well as EGFR recycling and stability.

upon PTPRO suppression (Figure 2B), suggesting Y416 site
is the major site for PTPRO-dependent dephosphorylation.
We also observed accumulation of SRC phosphorylated
at Y416 when we overexpressed the substrate-trapping
PTPRO-DA mutant (Figure 2C). Moreover, we found that
PTPRO-DA trapping mutant formed a complex with SRC
phosphorylated at Y416 (Figure 2C).
To
confirm
whether
PTPRO
directly
dephosphorylates SRC at Y416, we performed in
vitro dephosphorylation assay. Purified WT-PTPRO
or catalytically inactive PTPRO mutant (PTPRO-DA)
were incubated with recombinant active SRC protein
for different periods of time. Immunoblotting analysis of
Y416-phosphorylated SRC revealed that incubation with
WT-PTPRO but not with PTPRO-DA led to a significant
decrease of Y416-phosphorylated SRC (Figure 2D),
further confirming that PTPRO directly dephosphorylates
SRC at Y416.
Furthermore, data-mining of proteomics data from
461 primary colorectal tumor revealed that increased
phosphorylation of SRC at Y416 (p=0.039) is observed
in tumors with low PTPRO expression (cBioPortal,
Cerami et al., 2012, http://cbioportal.org/public-portal/)
(Figure 2E). These data corroborate that PTPRO directly
dephosphorylates SRC at Y416.
SRC phosphorylation at Y416 plays a crucial role
in the upregulation of its enzymatic activity [22–24],
suggesting that PTPRO affects EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845 by inhibiting SRC activity. To confirm that
PTPRO affects EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 in a
SRC-dependent manner, we assessed how inhibition
of SRC activity would affect EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845 in LIM1215 cells expressing either shGFP or
shPTPRO. We found that treatment with AZD0530, a
potent SRC inhibitor, completely blocked EGF-induced
SRC activation in both cell lines. Importantly, AZD0530
abolished PTPRO-mediated difference in levels of EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845 (Figure 2F). Taken together, these
data indicate that PTPRO affects EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845 by inhibiting SRC activity.

PTPRO regulates EGFR phosphorylation at
Y845 through direct activation of the SRC
kinase
To test whether EGFR could be a direct substrate of
PTPRO, we performed in vitro substrate trapping assay
described in detail in [16, 17]. We incubated the intracellular
domain of WT-PTPRO or a substrate-trapping PTPRO-DA
mutant with LIM1215 cell lysates (Figure 2A). However,
we did not detect any interaction with either WT-PTPRO, or
PTPRO-DA mutant. Because a recent study demonstrated
that EGFR and wild-type Drosophila ortholog of PTPRO
(Ptp10D) form a complex through their extracellular
domains [7], we suggested that extracellular domain of
PTPRO could be crucial for the interaction with EGFR.
Therefore, we assessed the interaction between a fulllength WT-PTPRO or PTPRO-DA mutant and EGFR.
In concordance with [7], we found that EGF stimulation
triggered PTPRO binding to EGFR. However, we did
not observe any stabilization of the interaction when we
overexpressed substrate-trapping PTPRO-DA compared
to WT-PTPRO (Supp. Figure 1). Together, these results
suggest that EGFR is not a direct substrate of PTPRO.
On the other hand, several reports demonstrated
that Y845 is not EGFR autophosphorylation site, instead
EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 is regulated by the SRC
kinase [18–20]. This suggests that PTPRO could affect
EGFR phosphorylation by negatively modulating SRC
activity. In fact, the in vitro substrate trapping assay
revealed a strong interaction between the substratetrapping PTPRO-DA mutant and the SRC kinase. To
confirm these  data, we used vanadate competition
approach [16, 17]. Vanadate is a small phosphotyrosine
mimetic molecule that competes with a phosphatase
substrate for binding to the phosphatase catalytic site.
We pre-treated recombinant WT-PTPRO or PTPRO-DA
proteins with 1 mM vanadate before incubation with
LIM1215 cell lysates. We found that pre-incubation with
vanadate completely abolished the binding of PTPRO-DA
mutant to SRC, strongly indicating that SRC is a direct
substrate of PTPRO (Figure 2A).
A recent report showed that a truncated form of
PTPRO, PTPROt, affects SRC phosphorylation at Y416 in
B-cells [21]. Consistently with this study, we found that
depletion of PTPRO in LIM1215 cells resulted in about
4-fold increase of SRC phosphorylated at Y416, whereas
SRC phosphorylation at Y527 was only slightly increased

SRC activation triggered by loss of PTPRO leads
to c-CBL degradation
In addition to alterations in SRC and EGFR
phosphorylation, PTPRO knockdown also affected
tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in a
SRC-dependent manner (Figure 2F), suggesting that
several SRC substrates may contribute to PTPROdependent regulation of EGFR stability and trafficking
(Figure 1 G, H). Given that SRC-mediated inhibition
of c-CBL, the major ubiquitin ligase responsible for
EGFR degradation, is one of the most well-established
mechanisms by which SRC regulates EGFR stability [25],
we examined whether PTPRO expression affects c-CBL
phosphorylation and stability.

In line with the observation that PTPRO suppression
led to SRC up-regulation (Figure 2B), we found
that PTPRO attenuation resulted in increased c-CBL
phosphorylation at Y731 (Figure 2G). Previous reports
also demonstrated that SRC-mediated phosphorylation
of c-CBL at Y731 promotes its auto-ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation [25, 26]. In fact, we observed
down-regulation of c-CBL protein expression in PTPROdepleted cells. On the other hand, treatment with the
proteasomal inhibitor MG132 restored the c-CBL
protein levels in PTPRO-knockdown cells (Figure 2G),
suggesting that loss of PTPRO triggers proteasomal
degradation of c-CBL by activating SRC activity. Given
that c-CBL down-regulation suppresses EGF-mediated
EGFR degradation, but facilitates its recycling [25],
this indicates that PTPRO may regulate both EGFR
stability and recycling by affecting SRC-mediated c-CBL
phosphorylation at Y731.
In addition, SRC has been implicated in
phosphorylation of a number of vesicular trafficking
proteins such as clathrin, dynamin, caveolin that could also
be in involved in modulation of EGFR trafficking [27–29].
Therefore, additional SRC substrates could contribute to
the regulation of EGFR internalization and degradation.

We next confirmed that PTPRO affects the MAPK
signaling by modulating SRC activity. Indeed, we found
that SRC inhibition by AZD0530 treatment completely
abolished PTPRO-mediated difference in ERK1/2
phosphorylation (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results
indicate that PTPRO controls of the MAPK signaling
pathway in colorectal cancer cells by regulating SRC
activity.

Low PTPRO expression leads to increased
resistance of colon cancer cells to EGFR
inhibitors
Gene expression analysis of 688 colon cancer
patient reveals decreased PTPRO expression in about
15% of all colon cancers. Down-regulation of PTPRO
mRNA expression strongly correlates with a poor patient
prognosis, highlighting the contribution of PTPRO to
colorectal cancer development and progression [14]. To
expand this observation, we analyzed PTPRO expression
in colon cancer cell lines. qRT-PCR analysis of colon
cancer cell lines revealed that the mRNA expression levels
of PTPRO were dramatically down-regulated in 10 of 14
colon cancer cell lines (Figure 4A). PTPRO protein levels
were also reduced in most of the analyzed colon cancer
cell lines (Figure 4A), indicating that PTPRO expression
is commonly down-regulated in colon cancer cell lines.
The observed difference between CRC cell lines and
patient data could be due to accumulation of additional
alterations during culturing of CRC cell lines [32].
Our results strongly imply PTPRO in negative
regulation of EGFR signaling, suggesting that PTPRO
expression could affect the sensitivity of colon cancer
cells to EGFR inhibitors. Previous reports demonstrated
that gefitinib treatment dramatically suppresses EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845, whereas gefitinib-resistance
is associated with increased SRC-dependent EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845 [33–35]. Prior study also
proposed that both enhanced SRC activity and EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845 could be a potential mechanism
of cetuximab resistance in colon cancer [36]. Because
we found that PTPRO plays a crucial role in EGFR
phosphorylation at Y845, we first examined the effect of
PTPRO suppression on survival of LIM1215 cells treated
with increasing concentrations of gefitinib. We found
that PTPRO depletion (Figure 4B) resulted in resistance
to gefitinib treatment in LIM1215 cells (Figure 4C).
Strikingly, gefitinib treatment of PTPRO knockdown cells
did not affect the levels of SRC phosphorylation at Y416
(Figure 4D). Furthermore, increased activity of SRC in
PTPRO-depleted cells led to enhanced phosphorylation
levels of both EGFR at Y845 and ERK1/2 even in
the presence of gefitinib (Figure 4D), suggesting that
the resistance of PTPRO-depleted cells to anti-EGFR
treatment could be explained by increased SRC activity

PTPRO inhibits EGF-dependent MAPK
pathway activation
Suppression of the SRC/EGFR pathway by
PTPRO suggests its role in negative regulation of MAPK
and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades that are two major
pathways downstream of EGFR. We assessed the impact
of PTPRO overexpression on phosphorylation levels of
MAPK and Akt kinases, using the CEER immunoassay
platform, a highly sensitive antibody-capture proximitybased immune-microarray [30]. We found that PTPRO
overexpression significantly decreased EGF-induced
phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2
(Figure 3A). On the other hand, we did not observe any
difference in Akt phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells
expressing either an empty vector or Flag-tagged PTPRO.
These results corroborate prior observations that EGFR
engages multiple downstream pathways in ways that are
context dependent (reviewed in [31]).
We confirmed the results of the CEER immunoassay
by immunoblotting. Analysis of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
phosphorylation kinetics upon EGF stimulation revealed
that PTPRO overexpression dramatically reduced EGFinduced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2
(Figure 3B). We also observed decreased ERK1/2 and
MEK1/2 phosphorylation after PTPRO overexpression
in CACO2 cell line (Figure 3C). In contrast, suppression
of PTPRO in LIM1215 and HCA46 colon cancer cells
led to enhanced phosphorylation of the MAPK kinases
(Figure 3D).

To confirm that PTPRO-mediated resistance to EGFR
inhibition is SRC-dependent, we treated LIM1215shGFP and LIM1215-shPTPRO cells with gefitinib alone

activity (Figure 4E). This result also suggests that tumors
with low PTPRO expression may be therapeutically
targetable by anti-SRC therapies.
Since cetuximab is clinically more relevant to
colorectal cancer patients, we also examined whether
of PTPRO expression levels affect the response to
cetuximab. Cetuximab treatment is currently prescribed
only to CRC patients with WT-KRAS, therefore we
performed the analysis using two WT-KRAS cell lines,
LIM1215 and HCA46. In agreement with the results on
gefitinib sensitivity, we found that PTPRO depletion in
either LIM1215 or HCA46 cells resulted in resistance to
cetuximab (Figure 5A, B).
To confirm our in vitro results, we next analyzed
status of PTPRO expression in CRC and patient response
to cetuximab treatment by using a transcriptome-focused
approach. We analyzed a cohort of 52 CRC patients
with WT-KRAS treated by cetuximab in the KULeuven

A

University Hospital [37]. Microarray expression data
were normalized using RMA background correction [38]
followed by quantile normalization and median polish
summarization of probe sets. We applied non-parametric
two-sample two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare
expression between patients with partial remission (PR)
or stable disease (SD) vs progressive disease (PD).
Consistently with our in vitro data (Figure 5A, B), we
observed that CRC patients with progressive disease
(PD) have significantly lower PTPRO expression than
patients with partial response (PR) and stable disease
(SD) (p-value= 0.01869) (Figure 5C). Taken together,
our results strongly indicate that PTPRO expression
affects the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to EGFR
inhibitors. These findings also suggest that PTPRO
expression levels may serve as a potential marker to
predict response of CRC patients with WT-KRAS to
EGFR inhibitors.

DISCUSSION

EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 has been shown to affect
EGFR-dependent growth and migration [47]. Several
studies also reported that SRC could also modulate EGFR
signaling by phosphorylating and regulating stability
of c-CBL, a major EGFR ubiquitin ligase [25]. Here
we found that up-regulation of SRC activity by loss of
PTPRO dramatically affects activation of EGFR/MAPK
pathway, further confirming the contribution of the SRC
kinase to colon cancer development and progression.
We also observed that WT-KRAS patients with low
PTPRO expression are correlated with progressive disease
after cetuximab treatment indicating that this group
of patients do not benefit from the therapy. Our results
revealed that loss of PTPRO promotes resistance to EGFR
inhibitors in colon cancer cells by maintaining activated
SRC and EGFR/MAPK pathway. Consistently with these
observations, it has been reported that EGFR and SRC
kinases cooperate in acquired resistance to cetuximab
treatment [36, 48]. Increased SRC activity and enhanced
EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 has been observed in
cetuximab-resistant CRC cells, whereas inhibition of
SRC activity sensitizes cells to cetuximab treatment
[36]. Furthermore, EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 has
been proposed as a diagnostic marker to assess gefitinib
sensitivity in colon cancers [49]. Importantly, we found
that whereas gefitinib treatment only partially abolished
EGFR phosphorylation at Y845, a potent SRC inhibitor
AZD0530, completely blocked it. These data suggest that
SRC inhibitors might be an alternative therapy for antiEGFR resistant patients with low PTPRO expression,
while several SRC inhibitors are currently being evaluated
in multiple clinical trials.

EGFR activity is determined by the balance of
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and PTP activities.
Several PTPs have been recently implicated in tumor
suppressors by antagonizing the oncogenic effects of RTK
signaling through direct RTK dephosphorylation. A highthroughput loss-of-function screen clearly demonstrated
that receptor-type PTPs play a crucial role in negative
regulation of major RTKs [39]. The results of this study
suggest that PTPRO could affect phosphorylation of
EGFR, EphA2, and HER2, whereas two other reports
showed that EphA2 and HER2 as direct PTPRO substrates
[15, 40].
Our study implicates PTPRO in negative regulation
of EGFR signaling through direct inactivation of SRC
kinase activity (Figure 6). We observed increased SRC
activity in a subset of CRC patients with low PTPRO
expression. Importantly, prior studies have reported that
elevated SRC activity in CRC is associated with advanced
malignancies and metastatic spread [24, 41–44]. SRC
contributes to cancer progression by triggering cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion. Activated SRC
phosphorylates a diverse spectrum of substrates that results
in up-regulation of several cancer-associated pathways
including EGFR signaling (reviewed in [31, 45]). There
is accumulating evidence that the biological synergy
between SRC and EGFR promotes colon cancer
tumorigenesis [21, 46]. Multiple studies demonstrated that
SRC-dependent EGFR phosphorylation at Y845, which is
located within the activation loop of EGFR kinase domain,
is essential for a full activation of the receptor [18, 20, 21].

Figure 6: PTPRO negatively regulates SRC/EGFR signaling. (A) By directly dephosphorylating SRC at Y416, PTPRO inactivates
SRC activity that blocks SRC-mediated EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 and c-CBL at Y731. Non-phosphorylated c-CBL triggers EGFR
ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. (B) Loss of PTPRO leads to SRC activation and accumulation of EGFR phosphorylated at Y845
and c-CBL at Y731. Phosphorylation of c-CBL promotes its proteasomal degradation and thereby active EGFR is recycling to the plasma
membrane.

Taken together, our results further highlight the
importance of the negative regulation of SRC/EGFR
pathway by tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, our results
emphasize that a deeper understanding of the regulation
of key kinases by phosphatases is crucial for choosing
optimal treatment strategy of colon cancer patients.

SW480, CACO2, LOVO, LIM1215, DIFI, DKO4,
COLO205, HT29, DLD1, HKE3, HCA-46, and HKH2)
were obtained from ATCC; HCT15, HCT116, LOVO,
COLO205 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen); HCA46, SW480, CACO2, LIM1215, DIFI,
DKO4, DLD1, HKE3, HKH2, HEK293T were grown in
DMEM medium (Invitrogen) and HT29 were grown in
McCoy medium (Lonza). All media were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
pLKO.1-shPTPRO-1 (TRCN0000002901), pLKO.1shPTPRO-2 (TRCN0000002903), and pLKO.1-shGFP
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviral infections
were carried out as described in TRC protocols (http://www
.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols). Infected
cells were selected by treatment with 3 µg/ml puromycin
(InvivoGen) for 2 days. Wild type (WT) full length PTPRO
expression construct was purchased from ORIGENE. GSTtagged catalytic domain of WT-PTPRO (pGEX-5X-1-WTPTPRO) plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Hiroyuki Seimiya,
The University of Tokyo. To generate a trapping mutant
DA-PTPRO, a point mutation resulting in D1102A mutation,
was introduced by using QuickChange Site-Directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Collaborative enzyme enhance reactive
ImmunoAssay (CEER)
Cell lysates were prepared according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and were sent to Prometheus
Laboratories Inc. (San Diego, CA) for further analysis.

In vitro substrate trapping assay
Cell pre-treated with 1mM pervanadate were lysed
on ice in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mM iodoacetic
acid, 1 mM orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). 10 mM
DTT was then added for 15 min to inactivate iodoacetic
acid and orthovanadate. After centrifugation at 14.000g
for 15 min, cell lysates were incubated with GST-tagged
recombinant PTPRO or GST alone conjugated to GSH
sepharose beads overnight at 4°C. The pulled-downed
proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and detected by
immunoblotting.

Immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation

In vitro dephosphorylation assay

Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM TrisHCl Ph7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5%
glycerol) containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Proteins were separated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and
immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitation was performed as
described elsewhere[16]. Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 Mm NaCl, 1% NP40) containing EDTA free protease inhibitor (Roche).
Flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using antiFlag (M2) agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and then eluted with
3×Flag peptides according to the manufacture’s protocol.
The following antibodies were used: mouse
monoclonal anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, M2), antiGAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich, GAPDH-71.1), anti-vinculin
(Sigma-Aldrich, clone hVIN-1), EGFR Antibody
FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 528), 4G10 Platinum
Anti-phosphotyrosine (Millipore); rabbit monoclonal­­

The assay was done as described previously
[50]. Briefly, equal molar amounts of SRC with either
WT-PTPRO or DA-PTPRO were added to the buffer
containing 25mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM
DTT. Reaction was carried out under 30oC for 2hrs with
gentle agitation. Aliquots were taken out every 15 min
and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The
proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and detected by
immunoblotting.
