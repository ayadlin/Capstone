Abstract
Transmembrane drug export mediated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein
contributes to clinical resistance to antineoplastics. In this study, we identiﬁed the substituted quinoline
HG-829 as a novel, noncompetitive, and potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor that overcomes in vitro and in vivo drug
resistance. We found that nontoxic concentrations of HG-829 restored sensitivity to P-glycoprotein oncolytic
substrates. In ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines, HG-829 signiﬁcantly enhanced cytotoxicity to daunorubicin,
paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, and etoposide. Coadministration of HG-829 fully restored in vivo antitumor
activity of daunorubicin in mice without added toxicity. Functional assays showed that HG-829 is not a Pgp
substrate or competitive inhibitor of Pgp-mediated drug efﬂux but rather acts as a noncompetitive modulator of
P-glycoprotein transport function. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that HG-829 is a potent, long-acting, and
noncompetitive modulator of P-glycoprotein export function that may offer therapeutic promise for multidrugresistant malignancies. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4204–13. 2012 AACR.

Introduction

Authors' Afﬁliations: 1Experimental Therapeutics, 2Drug Discovery Program, Mofﬁtt Cancer Center; 3Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of

have been identiﬁed to inhibit one or more of these transporters to suppress drug efﬂux and restore cellular cytotoxicity (2).
The vast majority of efﬂux modulators serve as competitive
substrate inhibitors. Substrate binding to Pgp recruits ATP,
which is believed to initiate dimerization in the nucleotidebinding site with corresponding structural changes favoring an
outward-facing conformation facilitating drug export (4). The
recent discovery of at least 4 distinct drug interaction sites for
Pgp suggests that effective suppression of transmembrane
export by such inhibitors will be substrate dependent (5–7).
With the exception of cyclosporin A in high-risk acute
myeloid leukemia, clinical trials testing ﬁrst-generation Pgp
inhibitors were disappointing (8). The second generation of
Pgp-speciﬁc modulators such as valspodar (PSC833) had
greater potency but deleterious pharmacokinetic interactions
and unsatisfactory outcomes in phase III trials (9–12). Initial
studies of third-generation Pgp inhibitors such as zosuquidar
and tariquidar (13, 14) show these agents to be safer and more
speciﬁc but with limited improvement in outcomes in the
tumor types studied.
In the screening of novel compounds that might have an
impact on steroid membrane trafﬁcking, the substituted quinoline HG-829 was identiﬁed as a potent and selective inhibitor
of Pgp-mediated drug resistance. Our studies show that HG829 is a potent, noncompetitive inhibitor of drug export by Pgp
that overcomes MDR in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods

De novo or acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) arising
from intrinsic cytoprotective mechanisms or tumor cell interaction with the microenvironment remains a major obstacle to
successful cancer treatment. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters form a superfamily of transmembrane proteins
that export a wide variety of substrates that range from ions,
amino acids, and lipids to oligopeptides and drugs (1, 2).
Included among the latter are amphiphatic antineoplastics
such as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and topoisomerase inhibitors (2). Transfection of ABC transporters is alone
sufﬁcient for in vitro drug resistance, and in the setting of
corresponding gene overexpression in primary malignancies,
such transport proteins have been implicated in clinical
chemotherapy resistance. The primary members of the
ABC transporters linked to clinical MDR, as reviewed by
Szakacs and colleagues (3), include ABCB1 [P-glycoprotein
(Pgp), MDR-1], ABCCs (MRP), and ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR/ABCP).
A large number of compounds, including cyclosporins, calmodulin inhibitors, and carboximide derivatives, and others

HG-829, a Novel Pgp Inhibitor

Figure 1. HG-829 does not alter cellular expression of Pgp. A, the original compound HG-829 (PGE2799041) was used after conversion to its hydrochloride
salt. B, K562-R cells overexpress Pgp (shaded dark histogram) compared with the parental cell line (shaded light histogram). Treatment with HG-829, 1 mmol/L,
for 48 hours did not affect Pgp expression in the parental (dotted line) or resistant cell line (heavy solid line). C, Pgp protein levels were not affected by HG-829
as shown by Western blotting in K562-R cells treated for 24 hours with 0.5, 1, 2.5 mmol/L, or drug vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide). K562-S did not express Pgp.
Densitometric analysis is representative of 2 independent experiments (mean  SEM).

culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen; FBS from
Mediatech, Inc.; Matrigel from BD Biosciences; and rhodamine
123, cyclosporin A, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vinblastine,
paclitaxel, vincristine, etoposide, and G418 were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Calcein AM was obtained from Molecular
Probes. Antibody against human Pgp, CD243-PE, and its
respective negative control were purchased from Beckman
Coulter. Pgp antibody for Western blotting was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and b-actin from SigmaAldrich.
Cell lines
K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia blast phase cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
NCI-H460 cells were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug screening laboratories. Pgp-overexpressing,
daunorubicin-resistant K562 cells (K562-R) were cultured with
60 ng/mL of daunorubicin once a week. Pgp-overexpressing,
vinblastine-selected NCI-H460/VBL cells were cultured with
22.72 ng/mL vinblastine once weekly. Both K562 and H460
were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were carried out with
cells cultured 7 to 10 days in drug-free media. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) stably transfected with empty
pcDNA 3.1 vector (HEK-293pc) or vector containing ABCB1
(MDR-19 cells), ABCC1 (MRP1 cells), and ABCG2 (BCRP cells)
were maintained in minimum essential media containing 10%
FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mg/mL G418 (15).

Resistant and susceptible cell lines were routinely conﬁrmed
by morphology, MTT, and Western blotting.
Pgp antibody staining
Pgp expression was detected by ﬂow cytometry. Cells were
washed 3 times in cold Staining Buffer (BD Biosciences) and
stained with CD243-PE or negative control for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were washed with staining buffer and
run on a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (488-nm laser, 585/42BP; BD
Biosciences). FlowJo 8.8.6 software was used to analyze the
data (Tree Star, Inc.).
Functional assays
Cells were resuspended in complete media (phenol-red–free
minimum essential media with 10% FBS), with 0.5 mg/mL
rhodamine 123 with or without HG-829 and incubated at 37 C
in 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells were
washed once in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) and placed on ice in
the dark or were resuspended in rhodamine-free complete
media with or without HG-829 or cyclosporin-A and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for a 1-hour efﬂux period. In other
investigations, cells were pretreated for 1 hour with the
modulator, washed 2 times with DPBS, and incubated with
0.5 mg/mL rhodamine followed by incubation in rhodaminefree media for up to 8 hours. After the efﬂux period, the cells
were washed with DPBS and placed on ice. A FACScan ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with a 488-nm argon laser
was used to analyze sample ﬂuorescence. Rhodamine 123

ﬂuorescence was collected using a 530-nm bandpass ﬁlter. A
minimum of 10,000 events was collected per sample. The
samples were gated on forward scatter versus side scatter to
exclude debris, and dead cells were excluded by propidium
iodide staining (16). Each experiment was repeated at least 3
times.
Calcein AM experiments were carried out as previously
described (17). Cells were washed 3 times with Krebs-HEPES
buffer (1.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 5.6 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 4.7 mmol/L KCL, 1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 1.1 mmol/L
MgSO4, 118 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4) and then 90 mL plated into
black 96-well plates and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 30
minutes with 10 mL of different concentrations of the test
compound. Calcein AM (0.3 mmol/L) was added to each well.
Fluorescence was detected at an excitation wavelength of
485 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm on a Synergy
HT (Bio-Tek Instruments) every 120 seconds. Competition
assay analysis was conducted as previously described (18).
Fluorescence was detected in the same way, and on the basis
of one-phase exponential curve ﬁtting, the upper plateau
(Ymax value) of each ﬂuorescence–time curve was determined. Nonlinear regression using the 4-parameter logistic
equation with variable Hill slope (GraphPad Prism version
5.01) was used to generate concentration–response curves.
Data were normalized using the slopes from ﬂuorescence–
time curves, setting the lowest determined single value to 0%
and the highest value as 100%. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times.
Immunoblotting
Cells were harvested, washed in PBS (3 times), and lysed in
1 RIPA buffer containing 250 mmol/L NaOV4, 2 mg/mL
aprotinin, 2 mg/mL leupeptin, 0.2 mg/mL pepstatin A, and
500 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride. One hundred
micrograms of lysate was loaded on 7.5% PAGE and separated
by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membranes, blocked in 5% dry milk solution, and
immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. Membranes were
developed using ECL according to manufacturer's protocols
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Proliferation assays
In a 96-well plate, approximately 14  103 K562-R, 4.5  103
H460/VBL, 8  103 transfected HEK-293 cells, and their
respective parental cells were plated in 180 mL with or without
modulators in complete media for at least 4 hours before
different concentrations of the drug were added. HEK-293–
transfected cells were allowed to adhere overnight before
addition of the drug. After 72 hours of treatment, 50 mL of
MTT substrate (2 mg/mL in PBS) was added and incubated for
4 hours at 37 C. Optical densities were read at 570 nm on a
Synergy HT. Mean values and SEM were generated from 4
replicates at each drug concentration and reported as the
percentage absorbance of control. The magnitude of sensitization to oncolytics by Pgp modulators was represented as the
"sensitization factor," calculated as the quotient of the IC50 for
the oncolytic with vehicle divided by the corresponding IC50
value in the presence of modulator.

Murine xenograft studies
Animals were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
South Florida (Tampa, FL) procedures and guidelines. Female
severe-combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) beige mice (CB17.
B6-Prkdcscid Lyst bg/Crl), 5 to 7 weeks old, were purchased
from Charles River and allowed to acclimate in the animal
facility for 1 week with a standard light–dark cycle and continuous access to food and water. K562 parental and K562-R
cells resuspended in PBS and an equal volume of Matrigel
were injected s.c. in the right ﬂank (10  106 in 100 mL). Tumor
volumes were determined by measuring the length (l) and
width (w) and calculating the volume (V ¼ w2  l/2). When
tumors reached approximately 100 to 200 mm3, the animals
were randomly assigned to treatment groups: (i) daunorubicin
2 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) every other day; (ii) daunorubicin 2 mg/kg i.p. þ HG-829 25 mg/kg i.p.; (iii) HG-829 25 mg/kg
i.p. daily; and (iv) HG-829 vehicle. Seven female mice were used
for each experimental condition. HG-829 and HG-829 vehicle
were administered continually via osmotic pumps (model
2004, ALZET, Durect Corporation). The animals were treated
for 12 days. Pumps were ﬁlled with HG-829 dissolved in a
mixture of 35% Cremophor EL:35% ethanol:30% water or with
solvents only. A 2-cm long vinyl catheter was attached to the
pumps and kept in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution for 40 hours at
37 C before implantation, which was conducted 24 hours
before initiation of daunorubicin treatment. Implantation of
the pump was conducted under sterile conditions on animals
anesthetized by inhalation with 3% isoﬂurane for induction
followed by 2% during surgical manipulation. The osmotic
pumps were placed s.c. on the dorsal surface near the shoulder
blade, and the catheter was placed through a cutaneous entry
created by a 16-gauge needle through the peritoneum into
the peritoneal cavity. The skin was closed with sterile surgical
sutures. Body weights were recorded every other day. Animals
were observed daily for mortality and signs of ill health (weight
loss, change in appetite, or behavioral changes).
Statistical analysis
ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison tests were used to
compare differences between groups in the proliferation assay,
calcein AM functional assay, and tumor volume measurements. Differences between rhodamine intracellular values
were compared by the Student t test. The IC50 values were
calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 from Windows
(GraphPad Software) by nonlinear regression analysis.

Results
Pgp expression
Increase in Pgp expression of resistant cells was detected by
ﬂow cytometry. Figure 1B shows a characteristic histogram of
Pgp expression on K562-R cells (shaded dark histogram)
compared with the parental cell line (shaded light histogram)
that superposes to the negative control histogram and
unstained cells. HG-829 has no signiﬁcant effect on Pgp
expression of the resistant and sensitive cells lines with
1 mmol/L HG-829 for 48 hours (Fig. 1B; K562-R, heavy solid

HG-829, a Novel Pgp Inhibitor

Figure 2. HG-829 inhibits Pgp-mediated rhodamine efﬂux in Pgp-overexpressing cells. K562-R (A) and MDR-1–transfected HEK-293 cells (MDR-19; B) were
incubated with 0.5 mg/mL rhodamine 123; cells were then washed and incubated in rhodamine-free medium with or without modulators for 1 hour.
Both cell lines export rhodamine (shaded histogram) after rhodamine intake (dotted histogram). Rhodamine efﬂux is inhibited in the presence of HG-829, 2.5
mmol/L in the media (heavy solid line; K562-R, P ¼ 0.03; MDR-19, P < 0.01) and to a lesser degree in the presence of 2.5 mmol/L cyclosporin A (CsA; dashed
lines). Representative results from 1 of at least 3 experiments are shown. C, HG-829 signiﬁcantly inhibited rhodamine efﬂux at concentrations as low as
0.07 mmol/L. Values represent mean  SEM of 4 independent experiments. Efﬂux comparison versus media alone: HG-829 2.5 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.002; 1.25 mmol/L,
P ¼ 0.003; 0.62 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.002; 0.31 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.002; 0.15 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.01; 0.07 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.02; cyclosporin A 2.5 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.023. The zero
values represent rhodamine intake (dotted) and efﬂux (white) without any modulator (D) HG-829 shows prolonged inhibition of Pgp-mediated rhodamine
efﬂux. Cells were incubated with 2.5 mmol/L HG-829 or cyclosporin A for 1 hour, followed by 0.5 mg/mL rhodamine 123. Control samples were incubated
with rhodamine alone. Cells were then washed and incubated in rhodamine-free medium. HG-829 promoted rhodamine retention for at least 8 hours
(1 hour, P < 0.0001; 2 hours, P < 0.0001; 4 hours, P ¼ 0.0374; 8 hours, P ¼ 0.0145). Cyclosporin A only showed statistically signiﬁcant retention at
1 hour (P ¼ 0.0002). Values represent media  SEM of 3 independent experiments ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001;     , P < 0.0001).

increase in Pgp detection by ﬂow cytometry, there were no
discernible changes in total Pgp by Western blotting (Fig. 1C)
or by quantitative PCR (Supplementary Table S1).
Functional assays
We ﬁrst examined the ability of HG-829 to inhibit Pgpmediated rhodamine 123 transport. After a 1-hour incubation
in rhodamine-free media, intracellular rhodamine concentration as measured by cellular ﬂuorescence in the Pgp-overexpressing cell lines, K562-R and MDR-1–transfected HEK-293
cells (MDR-19), decreased signiﬁcantly (Fig. 2A and B
and Table 1). Rhodamine efﬂux was signiﬁcantly inhibited
with addition of HG-829 (2.5 mmol/L) to the efﬂux media
(K562-R, P < 0.0001; MDR-19, P ¼ 0.0009). Cyclosporin A at
an equimolar concentration signiﬁcantly diminished rhodamine efﬂux but less effectively than HG-829 (K562-R, P < 0.01;
MDR-19, P ¼ 0.01). Inhibition of rhodamine efﬂux by HG-829
was observed at concentrations as low as 0.07 mmol/L (P ¼
0.02; Fig. 2C).
Nonsubstrate Pgp inhibitors display prolonged and sustained activity after washing and resuspension in drug-free
media (19, 20). To assess the duration of efﬂux inhibition by

HG-829, K562-R cells were preincubated with HG-829 for 1
hour, followed by rhodamine for 30 minutes, then washed and
resuspended in rhodamine and modulator-free media. Inhibition of rhodamine efﬂux was demonstrable up to 8 hours after
resuspension (P < 0.05; Fig. 2D). When the cells were preincubated with cyclosporin A, we observed a rapid and progressive
decrease in rhodamine retention with effective blockade of
rhodamine export for only 1 hour (P < 0.001; Fig. 2D). When HG829 was extensively washed before rhodamine intake, Pgp
inhibition persisted for at least 4 hour in K562-R cells (P ¼
0.001) and MDR-1–transfected HEK-293 cells (P < 0.001).
Preincubation with both modulators, HG-829 and cyclosporin
A, signiﬁcantly increased rhodamine intracellular intake, in
K562-R (P < 0.0001 and P ¼ 0.029 for HG-829 and cyclosporin A,
respectively) and MDR-19 (P < 0.0001 and P ¼ 0.003 for HG-829
and for cyclosporin A, respectively; Table 1). After 1-hour efﬂux
in rhodamine and modulator-free media, the cells preincubated with HG-829 completely maintained rhodamine intracellular concentration (Table 1); however, those preincubated
with cyclosporin A showed 75% rhodamine efﬂux in K562-R
cells (P ¼ 0.002) and 95% in MDR cells (P ¼ 0.0003). Both K562
parental and HEK-293 cells transfected with empty vector (i.e.,
Pgp-negative cells) accumulated rhodamine without change in

NOTE: Geometric mean ﬂorescent intensities of rhodamine efﬂux were analyzed; addition of HG-829 to efﬂux media signiﬁcantly
reduced rhodamine efﬂux in both cell lines (K562-R, P < 0.0001; MDR-19, P ¼ 0.0009). Cyclosporin A displayed less effective reduction
in rhodamine efﬂux (K562-R, P ¼ 0.0003; MDR-19, P ¼ 0.0116). Exposure to the Pgp modulators before rhodamine intake increased
intracellular rhodamine ﬂuorescence in both cell lines (K562-R, HG-829, P < 0.0001, cyclosporine A, P ¼ 0.0029; MDR-19, HG-829,
P < 0.0001, cyclosporin A, P ¼ 0.003). Preincubation with HG-829 completely inhibited rhodamine efﬂux in K562-R cells (P ¼ 0.0617)
and by 76% in MDR-19 cells (P ¼ 0.02). Preincubation with cyclosporin A enhanced rhodamine retention by only 5% in K562-R cells
(P ¼ 0.0018) and less than 25% in MDR-19 cells (P ¼ 0.0003).

retention in the presence or absence of modulators (data not
shown).
Similarly, we tested Pgp activity with the ﬂuorimetric measurement of the intracellular accumulation of calcein produced by ester hydrolysis of the Pgp substrate calcein AM.
K562-R cells overexpressing Pgp showed characteristically low
intracellular ﬂuorescence levels over time (Fig. 3A, circles).
Intracellular ﬂuorescence signiﬁcantly increased after HG-829
exposure in K562-R cells at all time points investigated (P <
0.001; Fig. 3A). Representative data at 19-minute incubation are
shown in Fig. 3B. HG-829 treatment signiﬁcantly increased
cellular ﬂuorescence compared with control (HG-829, 0.5
mmol/L, P ¼ 0.0015; 1 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.0019). Cyclosporin A
signiﬁcantly increased ﬂuorescence accumulation at only 1
mmol/L (P ¼ 0.05). These functional data suggest that HG-829
is not a Pgp substrate or competitive inhibitor of Pgp-mediated
drug efﬂux.
To further discern the precise interaction of HG-829
with Pgp to inhibit drug efﬂux, we assessed concentrationdependent enzyme kinetics for calcein AM efﬂux through
application of the Lineweaver–Burk linearization technique
(17, 18). The y-intercept of the graph is equivalent to the inverse
of the maximum reaction velocity (Vmax), whereas the xintercept of the graph represents 1/Km (Michaelis–Menten
constant). Competitive inhibitors share the same y-intercept,
whereas there are different slopes and x-intercepts between
the 2 data sets. Noncompetitive inhibition-produced plots have
the same x-intercept as the uninhibited enzyme, as Km is
unaffected, but display disparate slopes and y-intercepts. The
ﬁndings in Fig. 3C are consistent with the latter or noncompetitive P-glycoprotein inhibition by HG-829.

HG-829 sensitizes ABCB1–overexpressing cells
to antineoplastics
We investigated the sensitivity of ABCB1-overexpressing
drug-resistant and -sensitive parental cells to HG-829 by
changes in cytotoxicity upon exposure to antineoplastic
substrates in a 72-hour MTT proliferation assay. Addition
of HG-829 to antineoplastic substrates for Pgp enhanced
drug-induced cytotoxicity in K562-R cells in a concentrationdependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2). As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, ABCB1-expressing
cells displayed 30- to 10,000-fold higher IC50 values for the
Pgp substrates daunorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, paclitaxel, and etoposide than the corresponding parental cells
(Tables 2 and 3). Coincubation with HG-829 at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mmol/L completely reversed drug resistance in each of the cell lines tested. In K562-R cells,
daunorubicin cytotoxicity was restored to a level approaching that of the parental line at an HG-829 concentration of
0.5 mmol/L (IC50 ¼ 105 mol/L media, 1.76  107 mol/L,

cyclosporin A, P < 0.001), conﬁrming the substrate-dependent interaction of cyclosporin A. Potentiation of cytotoxicity by HG-829 extended to all other antineoplastics
tested, including paclitaxel, vincristine, and etoposide
(Fig. 5A–C and Table 3, paclitaxel, vincristine, and etoposide). In contrast, cyclosporin A did not enhance the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel and only slightly enhanced cytotoxicity
of vincristine, and etoposide; however, this was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3, paclitaxel, vincristine, and
etoposide).
The activity of HG-829 against other non-Pgp ABC transporters, such as MRP1 (ABCC1) and breast cancer resistance
protein (ABCG2), was evaluated in HEK-293–transfected cells.
HG-829 displayed only moderate concentration-dependent
sensitization of cells expressing either transporter at concentrations up to 2 and 4 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5D and E
and Table 3, vincristine and mitoxantrone).

Efﬁcacy in human xenografts
The ability of HG-829 to reverse Pgp-mediated MDR in vivo
was evaluated in K562-R and parental cell xenografts
implanted in female SCID beige mice treated with daunorubicin. Intraperitoneal treatment with daunorubicin alone had
no signiﬁcant effect on the growth rate of K562-R xenografts,
whereas coadministration of HG-829 restored the antitumor
activity of daunorubicin (P < 0.01; Fig. 6A). Daunorubicin
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volumes in mice bearing the
parental xenografts (P < 0.05 daunorubicin vs. HG-829 alone,
P < 0.01 daunorubicin vs. HG-829 vehicle; Fig. 6B), and coadministration of HG-829 did not enhance the antitumor effects.
Importantly, HG-829 was well tolerated either alone or in
combination, as evidenced by the absence of differences in
weight change compared with the vehicle or HG-829–treated
cohorts. Of interest, animals treated with the combination of
HG-829 and daunorubicin had less weight loss than those
treated with daunorubicin alone. Animals bearing K562-R
xenografts treated with daunorubicin, however, had a significant decrease in weight compared with the other 3 treatment
groups (P < 0.001). Similarly, in animals implanted with K562
parental xenografts treated with daunorubicin, weight loss was
greater than that of the daunorubicin þ HG-829 combination
(P < 0.05) and animals treated with HG-829 alone (P < 0.001,
data not shown). Of interest, treatment with HG-829 alone
modestly reduced tumor growth in animals bearing the
sensitive (P ¼ 0.09) or resistant xenografts (P ¼ 0.03).

Discussion
9.23  109 mol/L with HG-829, 1 mmol/L, P < 0.01; Table 2,

concentration of 0.5 mmol/L (IC50 ¼ 2.81  107 mol/L),
yielding no signiﬁcant increase in cytotoxicity (Table 2,
doxorubicin). Interestingly, cyclosporin A showed potent
reversal of vinblastine resistance that was comparable with
that of HG-829 in H460/VBL cells (Fig. 4C and Table 2,

Enhancement of anticancer activity of conventional antineoplastics or restoration of chemosensitivity in resistant
cancer cells is challenged by the redundancy of cellular
defense mechanisms contributing to drug resistance. MDR
encompasses a complex phenotype characterized by cellular
resistance to a wide range of structurally unrelated, and
mechanistically diverse, antineoplastics that can arise from
the activation of genes involved in transmembrane drug

transport, cell adhesion, intercellular communication, detoxiﬁcation, and vesicle transport, as well as repression of genes
involved in apoptosis (21). Studies with P-glycoprotein inhibitors are not only relevant for MDR; they could also be used to
increase oral absorption of substrate compounds or to potentially increase brain penetration. A number of inhibitors of
ABCB1-mediated MDR have been developed, and many have

been tested in the clinical setting with limited success. Most
of these compounds, such as cyclosporin A, act as competitive
substrate inhibitors (22). Given that substrates interact with
Pgp at multiple distinct sites (7), it is not surprising that
capacity to suppress drug efﬂux by competitive inhibitors is
substrate dependent. Cyclosporin A displayed remarkable
drug-dependent variability. There was no enhancement of

lines; however, vinblastine resistance was effectively reversed
in H460/VBL cells , a result that was similar to data reported by
de Souza and colleagues (23). Our investigations show that the
novel substituted quinoline, HG-829, is a potent and selective
inhibitor of ABCB1-mediated MDR, with comparable activity in
reversing resistance in both drug-selected and ABCB1-transfected cells that extends to all Pgp substrates investigated,
including daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vinblastine,
vincristine, and etoposide. HG-829 had weak inhibitory activity
against other ABC transporters such as MRP1 (ABCC1) and
breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), indicating that the
modulatory effects of HG-829 are primarily Pgp-speciﬁc.

changes that unmask external epitopes recognized by UIC2
by ﬂow cytometry (24, 25). The absence of discernible
changes in total Pgp protein by immunoblot suggests that
interaction of HG-829 with Pgp unmasks conformationsensitive epitopes, thereby increasing accessibility for antibody recognition. Our ﬁndings that HG-829 completely
reversed resistance to a wide range of structurally unrelated
compounds in ABCB1 expressing cells and the ability to
induce both rhodamine123 and calcein AM retention suggests that HG-829 inhibits drug export in a noncompetitive,
substrate-independent manner. Our analysis of enzyme kinetics for calcein AM efﬂux supports noncompetitive inhibition
(Fig. 3C); however, the precise mechanism of inhibition
remains under investigation. Compared with cyclosporin A,
HG-829 displayed greater potency at equimolar concentrations, showing a more than 10-fold enhancement of cytotoxicity in highly resistant cells. Enhancement of daunorubicin
cytotoxicity in multidrug-resistant cells was also conﬁrmed
in vivo in murine xenografts. Coadministration of HG-829
restored antitumor activity of daunorubicin in K562-R
xenografts compared with either daunorubicin (P < 0.01) or
HG-829 alone. Surprisingly, treatment with HG-829 alone
modestly reduced tumor growth in animals bearing the
sensitive or resistant xenografts. Given that HG-829 had no
discernible impact on tumor cell viability in vitro, these data
suggest that the intrinsic antitumor effects of HG-829 in vivo
relate to effects on tumor microenvironment or cells in the
supportive niche, perhaps by modifying Pgp-mediated cytokine elaboration.
Consistent with the cytotoxicity data, drug accumulation
studies showed that HG-829 signiﬁcantly enhanced intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin in ABCB1-overexpressing cells while having no effect in parental cells (data
not shown). Cellular efﬂux of rhodamine123 or calcein AM
was completely suppressed at HG-829 concentrations as
low as 0.07 mmol/L. Moreover, unlike the results with the
competitive Pgp inhibitor cyclosporin A, suppression of

4212

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

both rhodamine 123 and calcein AM efﬂux after 1-hour
exposure to HG-829 was sustained after washing and resuspending resistant cells in drug-free media for up to 8 hours.
These ﬁndings indicate that the activity of HG-829 is not
dependent upon continuous drug exposure (as opposed to
competitive inhibitors) while promoting sustained suppression of Pgp transport capacity. These data suggest that
HG-829 acts as a novel noncompetitive and sustained
inhibitor of Pgp transport function, perhaps by promoting
allosteric changes that preclude or impair drug binding and
transport (26). Further investigation in clinical trials may be
warranted.
