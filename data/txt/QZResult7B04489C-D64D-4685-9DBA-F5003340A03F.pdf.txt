Abstract
Activation of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) promotes malignant transformation and metastasis.
Signaling through the AKT-mTOR pathway activates eIF4E by phosphorylating the inhibitory 4E binding
proteins (4E-BP). This liberates eIF4E and allows binding to eIF4G. eIF4E can then be phosphorylated at serine
209 by the MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnk), which also interact with eIF4G. Although dispensable for normal
development, Mnk function and eIF4E phosphorylation promote cellular proliferation and survival and are
critical for malignant transformation. Accordingly, Mnk inhibition may serve as an attractive cancer therapy. We
now report the identification of a potent, selective and orally bioavailable Mnk inhibitor that effectively blocks 4E
phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. In cultured cancer cell lines, Mnk inhibitor treatment induces
apoptosis and suppresses proliferation and soft agar colonization. Importantly, a single, orally administered dose
of this Mnk inhibitor substantially suppresses eIF4E phosphorylation for at least 4 hours in human xenograft
tumor tissue and mouse liver tissue. Moreover, oral dosing with the Mnk inhibitor significantly suppresses
outgrowth of experimental B16 melanoma pulmonary metastases as well as growth of subcutaneous HCT116
colon carcinoma xenograft tumors, without affecting body weight. These findings offer the first description of a
novel, orally bioavailable MNK inhibitor and the first preclinical proof-of-concept that MNK inhibition may
provide a tractable cancer therapeutic approach. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1849–57. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds the 50
m GpppN cap structure (where N is any nucleotide) of
mRNAs, delivering these mRNAs to the eIF4F complex. This
complex, comprised of eIF4E, the ATP-dependent RNA
helicase, eIF4A, and the scaffolding protein eIF4G, then
scans through and unwinds the 50 untranslated region of
the mRNA to reveal the initiation codon and enable translation (1, 2). eIF4F complex assembly is dependent upon
eIF4E availability. Under stress conditions such as serum
starvation and amino acid depletion, the 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1, 2, 3) are hypo-phosphorylated and bound to
eIF4E, precluding binding of eIF4E to eIF4G. Activation of

the AKT-mTOR pathway triggers 4E-BP phosphorylation,
liberating eIF4E to engage eIF4G, thereby promoting eIF4F
complex assembly (3). Within the eIF4F complex, eIF4E is
specifically phosphorylated at serine 209 by the MAPKinteracting kinases (Mnk), which are also bound to eIF4G
(4–6). Mnk1 is responsible for inducible phosphorylation of
eIF4E, whereas Mnk2 activity is constitutive (7). Both eIF4F
complex assembly and the subsequent phosphorylation of
eIF4E by Mnks appear to play critical roles in malignant
transformation (8–10).
Increased eIF4E function selectively enhances the translation of mRNAs with long, highly-structured 50 untranslated regions (UTR), as these mRNAs require increased
eIF4F complex activity for ribosome loading (1, 2). eIF4E
also promotes the nucleocytoplasmic transport of select
mRNAs like cyclin D1 (11). eIF4E-regulated mRNAs generally encode proteins involved in key aspects of malignancy
including proteins involved in cell growth (cyclin D1,
c-myc), angiogenesis (VEGF, FGF-2), invasion (MMP-9,
heparanase), and survival (survivin, BCL-2; refs. 1, 12). By
selectively upregulating translation of these malignancyrelated mRNAs, eIF4E overexpression transforms cells,
enabling tumor formation (13) and even metastasis (14).
In transgenic mice, ectopic eIF4E expression increases the

incidence of multiple cancers, including lymphomas, lung
adenocarcinomas, angiosarcomas, and hepatomas (15) and
accelerates lymphomagenesis in the Em-myc mouse lymphoma model (16). In this model, eIF4E phosphorylation by
Mnk is critical as mutation of eIF4E at serine 209 or
mutational inactivation of Mnk blocks lymphomagenesis
(8). Similarly, in PTEN-null mouse lymphoma and prostate
cancer models, engineered genetic disruption of eIF4E
phosphorylation abrogates tumor development (9, 10). In
cultured cancer cells, eIF4E phosphorylation has also been
shown to be critical for proliferation and survival (17, 18).
Importantly, though critical for malignant transformation
(8–10), Mnk function and eIF4E phosphorylation are dispensable for normal development (19).
In a wide variety of primary human cancer tissues, eIF4E
activation has been linked to disease progression. In ovarian,
breast, lung, and prostate cancers, 4E-BP hyperphosphorylation, which increases eIF4E availability, is dramatically
increased and related to reduced patient survival (20–23).
Overexpression of eIF4E has also been routinely linked to
decreased survival in patients with advanced cancers, including head and neck, breast, prostate, lung and hematologic
malignancies (1, 12, 22–24). Likewise, more recent work has
revealed that eIF4E phosphorylation is specifically increased
in advanced malignancies (9, 23–24, Carter JH and colleagues
unpublished results).
Collectively, these data implicate enhanced eIF4E function
in malignancy and suggest that targeting eIF4E may provide
an attractive approach for cancer therapy. Indeed, several
inhibitors of eIF4E function have recently been developed. An
eIF4E targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) has advanced
through phase 1 clinical study (25). An anti-viral guanosine
analogue, Ribavirin, which reportedly suppresses eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap structure (26), has progressed through
phase 1 studies in acute myeloid patients (AML) patients (27).
An inhibitor of the eIF4E: eIF4G interaction, 4EGI-1, has also
recently been developed, providing proof of concept that the
eIF4F complex can be effectively disrupted by small molecule
inhibitors (28).
Targeting eIF4E phosphorylation through direct inhibition
of the Mnk kinases is another attractive approach. As Mnk
function and eIF4E phosphorylation are dispensable for normal development (19), pharmacologically inhibiting Mnk may
provide an avenue to target tumor cells while sparing normal
tissues. To date, there are no known, orally bioavailable,
selective inhibitors of Mnk. We now report that the antifungal agent, cercosporamide, is a potent, selective, orally
bioavailable Mnk inhibitor. Cercosporamide blocks eIF4E
phosphorylation in cultured cancer cells, inducing apoptosis,
suppressing proliferation, and reducing soft agar colonization.
Cercosporamide also effectively blocks eIF4E phosphorylation
within 30 minutes after oral administration in normal mouse
tissues and xenografted tumors, reduces tumor growth in
HCT116 tumor bearing animals, and suppresses the outgrowth of B16 melanoma lung metastases. Collectively, these
data substantiate the notion that blocking Mnk function,
and eIF4E phosphorylation, may be an attractive anticancer
strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression, and purification of Mnk1 protein
Mnk1 was cloned by PCR amplification from human lung
cDNA (Clontech) with DNA primer sequences 50 CGCGGATCCCATATGGTATCTTCTCAAAAGTTGG-30
and
50 -CGCGGATCCACTTAGTCAGAGTGCTGTGGGCGGGCTC30 , based on Mnk1 DNA sequence accession number
NM_003684.1 and sequence confirmed. The Mnk1 gene product was cloned into pFASTBAC HTb containing a C-terminal
HIS-tag fusion protein, transformed into E. coli DH10 BAC
cells, and transfected into Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were infected with
the viral supernatant to an MOI of 2.0 and incubated at 28 C
for 72 hours. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 mL
lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF, 0.5% NP40, 20 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmol/L Imidazole, 1 mmol/L PMSF, and 1
EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor pellet (Roche). The
lysate was centrifuged at 30,000  g for 30 minutes to remove
cell debris, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-mm
Nalgene filter cup. Purification of Mnk1 protein was performed using an HR 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) packed
with Ni/NTA beads (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer.
Filtered cell lysate was loaded followed by a series of column
washes, using lysis buffer according to manufacturer's protocol. Mnk1 protein was eluted with 200 mmol/L Imidazole and
analyzed by PAGE. Tryptic Digestion of purified protein was
performed and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption
ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
for protein confirmation.
High-throughput screen for Mnk1 inhibition
Individual reactions were performed as follows: 0.25 mg
purified Mnk1 protein was incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature in the presence of 200 mmol/L optimized internal
peptide substrate (RRRLSSLRA) in 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 1
mmol/L MnCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L ATP, 0.005% Triton
X-100, and 1 mci/well 33P-ATP. Compounds were tested at 10
mmol/L final concentration. Reactions were terminated using
0.5% phosphoric acid with the entire reaction loaded by Multimek onto filter plates (Millipore) pre-wet with 0.5% phosphoric
acid, and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Filter
plates were extracted twice in 0.5% phosphoric acid. Microscint
was added to each well and read on a scintillation counter. A
total of 30,000 compounds were screened, and active compounds were defined as having more than 50% inhibition
relative to untreated controls. Compounds with potency less
than 5 mmol/L were selected for further testing.
CEREP kinase selectivity panel
Cercosporamide was tested at 3 concentrations (0.2, 2, 20
mmol/L) across a panel of 76 kinases (CEREP, Paris, France).
Kinases tested included AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, ALK, ALK4, AurA,

Western blot analysis
HCT116 and B16 cells were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in the recommended media supplemented with 10%
FBS. Cells were plated 1 day prior to treatment. CGP5730 was
dosed at 20 mmol/L and cercosporamide was dosed at concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 20 mmol/L and incubated for
either 1 or 24 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2. Protein lysates were
harvested in Biosource lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and Western
blots were run as described (22) with the following antibodies:
p-eIF4E 1:500, Mcl-1 1:500 (Cell Signaling), eIF4E 1:1,000 (BD
Biosciences), b-actin 1:10,000 (Sigma), mouse and rabbit
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Proliferation and apoptosis assays
Cancer cell lines HCT116 (colon), B16 (melanoma), MJ
(CTCL), Farage (non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma), Calu6,
and H1975 (non–small-cell lung carcinoma) were purchased
from ATCC and cultured in supplier's recommended media
supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were plated onto poly-Dlysine–coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) 1 day prior to
treatment. Cercosporamide was dosed at concentrations ranging from 0.156 mmol/L to 20 mmol/L. For proliferation assays,
cells were incubated for 6 days in the presence of cercosporamide at 37 C in 5% CO2. Cells were then subjected to the
CellTiter Aqueous 96 One Solution cell proliferation assay
(Promega) and measured on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader
(Molecular Devices). Response is represented relative to
DMSO controls set at 100%. Apoptosis assays were performed
after a 72-hour incubation with cercosporamide using the Cell
Death Detection ELISA assay (Roche). Apoptosis induction is
represented relative to DMSO-treated controls set at 1.0. Error
bars denote SEM.
Soft agar colonization assays
In a 6-well plate, 7,500 filtered B16 cells were added in the
presence of 10 mmol/L final cercosporamide and 0.35% low
melting point agarose onto a bed of 0.7% low melting point
agarose with DMEM media containing 10% final FBS final
concentration. Compound and cells were mixed for 30 minutes at 4 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C for 14 days,
replacing the media with cercosporamide or DMSO every
2 days. After 14 days, media were removed and colonies
visualized after incubation with 0.005% crystal violet solution
for 1 hour at 37 C. Colonies were scanned and counted using
10% of the area in the counting grid.
Animal studies

facility and was approved by the Eli Lilly and Company
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For target
inhibition in xenograft tissues and xenograft growth studies,
5  106 HCT116 cells were implanted subcutaneously in
female athymic Nu/Nu nude mice as described (29). Cercosporamide was formulated for oral delivery (0.2 mL/dose) by
dissolving compound in one-half volume 20% captisol dissolved in 25 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, followed by
addition of an equal volume of 1 mol/L NaHCO3 and briefly
sonicated. Cercosporamide was administered p.o. by gavage to
mice once the group mean tumor size reached 250 mm3.
Tumor and liver tissues were collected at the indicated timepoints. Tissue lysates were prepared as described (29).
To examine the antitumor growth effects of cercosporamide, HCT116 colon carcinoma xenografts were implanted
and measured as described (29). Cercosporamide was administered p.o. daily by gavage once mean tumor volumes
reached 150 mm3 and everyday thereafter for 30 consecutive
days. Data shown represent tumor volumes at each measured
time-point divided by initial tumor volume for each animal
(T1/T0). Error bars represent SEM. Tumor volume data were
transformed to log scale for statistical analyses. P values were
generated using repeated measures analysis.
For the B16 melanoma experimental pulmonary metastasis
model, 100,000 cells were injected into the tail vein of nude
mice 1 day prior treatment. Mice were dosed p.o. by gavage
with either 10 mg/kg BID or 20 mg/kg q.d. for 12 consecutive
days. Lung tissue was collected and placed in 10% neutral
buffered-formalin followed by 70% ethanol storage. Individual
lung metastases were counted visually. Cercosporamide treatment groups were graphed relative to vehicle-treated control
set at 100%. Error bars represent SEM. P values were generated
using Student's t test.

Results
Identification of Mnk inhibitors by high-throughput
screen
CGP57380 was reported to be a selective Mnk inhibitor with
an IC50 of approximately 1 mmol/L (30). Subsequent studies
have revealed that this compound effectively inhibits additional kinases at least as potently as Mnk, including CK1 (31).
Moreover, this compound, though cell permeable, has not
been widely reported for usage in experimental animal models
of cancer.
We therefore sought to identify potent, selective Mnk
inhibitors that could effectively block eIF4E phosphorylation
in cancer cells and in animal models of cancer. A total of
30,000 compounds were screened for inhibitory activity
against Mnk1. Twenty-eight compounds were identified with
confirmed 10-point IC50 values less than 1.0 mmol/L. The most
potent compound of these 28 showed an IC50 of 116 nmol/L
for Mnk1 and 11 nM for Mnk2 (Table 1). This compound is a
known antifungal agent named cercosporamide (Fig. 1; ref.
32). To evaluate the selectivity for Mnks versus other kinases,
cercosporamide was evaluated at 0.2, 2, and 20 mmol/L against
a panel of 76 other kinases. Any kinases showing evidence for
inhibition were further tested using 10 point IC50 curves. The

IC50 values for these kinases are shown in Table 1. The
inhibitory activity of cercosporamide against these other
kinases was limited. Jak3, a kinase expressed almost exclusively in hematopoietic tissues (33), was the only kinase
inhibited with an IC50 of less than 100 nmol/L. Cercosporamide has also been reported to inhibit Candida albicans
PKC1 (caPKC1) with a 44 nmol/L IC50. However, cercosporamide did not show appreciable activity against human PKCs
(PKCa, b, g, and e; ref. 34). Consistent with these published
data, our kinase profiling data also show that cercosporamide
is inactive versus PKCb2. Collectively, these data reveal that
cercosporamide is a potent Mnk inhibitor, with specificity
particularly for Mnk2.
Mnk inhibition in cell culture
Mnk1 and 2 phosphorylate a number of intracellular proteins, most notably eIF4E at serine 209, with Mnk2 activity
being constitutive and Mnk1 inducible in most cells (7). To
assess the cell-based activity of cercosporamide, we evaluated
eIF4E phosphorylation (p-eIF4E) by Western blotting. P-eIF4E
was evident in all cancer cells tested including B-cell lympho-

mas (Farage), cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (MJ), the non–
small-cell lung cancers (Calu6 and H1975; data not shown), the
B16 mouse melanoma line and the human colorectal cancer
cell line HCT116 (Fig. 2). In these cell lines, cercosporamide
blocked p-eIF4E serine 209 in a dose-dependent manner
starting 1 hour after treatment and lasting through at least
24 hours. Similar activity was evident in Calu 6, H1975, Farage
B-cell, and MJ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines (data not
shown). CGP57380 (CGP) dosed at 20 mmolL is included for
comparison. Levels of p-Erk and p-p38, which can activate
Mnks, were unchanged by cercosporamide treatment at 24
hours indicating that blockade of eIF4E phosphorylation was
not the result of inhibition upstream of Mnk (Fig. 2C). Importantly, cercosporamide treatment not only reduced eIF4E
phosphorylation but also resulted in reduced expression of
the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (Fig. 2D), which was previously reported to be regulated by Mnk activity (8).
Cercosporamide suppresses cell proliferation, blocks
anchorage-independent growth and induces apoptosis
B16 and HCT116 cell lines were treated for 6 days in the
presence of cercosporamide (0.6–20 mmol/L) to evaluate
whether Mnk inhibition may be antiproliferative in vitro.
Proliferation was decreased in both cell lines at similar drug
concentrations (starting with 2.5 mmol/L; Fig. 3A). We next
assessed whether cercosporamide treatment might also block
anchorage-independent growth in the B16 melanoma cell line.
B16 cells were grown in soft agar for 14 days, with or without
10 mmol/L cercosporamide—a concentration that effectively
blocked p-eIF4E levels and suppressed monolayer growth
(Fig. 2A). Colony formation was reduced approximately 50%
by cercosporamide treatment (Fig. 3B). Because eIF4E phosphorylation has been linked to cell survival (8), we also tested
whether Mnk inhibition might be proapoptotic. In both
HCT116 and B16 cell lines, apoptosis was induced at cercosporamide concentrations above 2.5 mmol/L (Fig. 3C). To verify
that the oligonucleosomal fragmentation data reflected caspase-induced cell death (i.e., apoptosis), we cotreated HCT116
cells with cercosporamide and the caspase inhibitor ZVAD.
ZVAD cotreatment completely suppressed cercosporamideinduced oligonucleosomal fragmentation, supporting the
notion that cercosporamide elicits a caspase-dependent cell
death (apoptosis; Fig. 3D). Collectively, these data show that
cercosporamide, at concentrations that effectively inhibit
eIF4E phosphorylation (i.e., above 2.5 mmol/L), blocks cellular
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth and elicits
apoptosis.
Cercosporamide inhibits p-eIF4E in xenografted
human tumors and reduces tumor growth
We next examined whether cercosporamide treatment
might effectively suppress Mnk activity (i.e., eIF4E phosphorylation) in mice after oral administration. Cercosporamide was delivered p.o. by gavage once at 20 mg/kg in
HCT116 tumor-bearing nude mice. Tumor and liver tissues
were collected 0.5, 1, 4, and 24 hours after dosing. P-eIF4E
levels were reduced in both tumor and liver tissue within 30
minutes of administration and were suppressed in tumor

(Fig. 4A). Moreover, once daily administration of cercosporamide (20 mg/kg) for 30 consecutive days significantly
suppressed growth of HCT116 xenograft tumors (P < 0.05,
repeated measures analyses), without significantly affecting
body weight (vehicle control ¼ 21.1  0.6 g; 20 mg/kg
cercosporamide ¼ 20.2  0.9 g). These data indicate that
oral administration of cercosporamide can effectively inhibit
Mnk activity in normal mouse and xenografted human
tumor tissues and can significantly suppress xenograft
growth.
Cercosporamide suppresses outgrowth of pulmonary
metastases
eIF4E overexpression can transform cells (13) and even
induce metastases in experimental models (1, 14). Reducing
eIF4E expression, even by 50%, suppresses soft agar colonization by more than 90% and significantly reduces the
formation and growth of experimental lung metastases

(35, 36). We therefore chose to examine whether cercosporamide treatment might suppress experimental lung metastases using the highly pigmented B16 melanoma model.
Mice were injected intravenously with 100,000 B16 melanoma cells 1 day prior to treatment to enable these intravenously injected cells to seed within the lungs. The next
day, and for 12 consecutive days thereafter, cercosporamide
was dosed p.o. by gavage, at either 20 mg/kg once daily or 10
mg/kg twice daily. Mice were sacrificed and lung tissue was
collected. Individual lung metastases were counted visually.
The numbers of metastases were significantly reduced in
both the 10 mg/kg (P ¼ 0.03) and 20 mg/kg treatment (P ¼
0.02) groups relative to vehicle controls. Importantly, mice
treated with 10 mg/kg twice daily or 20 mg/kg once daily
showed only marginal body weight changes (10 mg/kg ¼ 23.4
 0.5 g, 20 mg/kg ¼ 25.2  0.4 g) compared with vehicle

Discussion
Though dispensable for normal organismal development
(19), Mnk function and eIF4E phosphorylation may be
essential for malignant transformation (8–10). Accordingly,
Mnk may be an ideal target for cancer therapy. In the
murine Em-Myc lymphoma model, constitutively activated
Mnk promotes lymphomagenesis, whereas expression of
dominant-negative Mnk suppresses lymphomagenesis and
prolongs survival. Further, mutation of eIF4E serine 209 to
alanine precludes Mnk-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation
and also blocks lymphomagenesis (8). Likewise, engineered
genetic disruption of eIF4E phosphorylation prevents tumor
development in PTEN-null murine lymphoma and prostate
cancer models (9, 10). Similarly, the efficiency with which
eIF4E transforms cultured cells is dependent upon Mnkmediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine 209 (17).
Recent evidence has now shown that eIF4E phosphorylation
is also commonly elevated in primary human cancer tissues
(9, 23, 24) and predicts poorer survival in non–small-cell
lung cancer and prostate cancer patients (9, 23, 25). Col-

lectively, these data implicate Mnk-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation in malignant transformation and substantiate
the notion that Mnk inhibition may be an attractive anticancer therapy.
We report here that the known antifungal agent, cercosporamide, is a potent, selective inhibitor, particularly of
Mnk2. Cercosporamide demonstrated an in vitro IC50 of
11 nmol/L for Mnk2 and 116 nmol/L for Mnk1. Cercosporamide treatment rapidly and effectively blocked eIF4E phosphorylation in cultured cancer cells from multiple cell
lineages, suppressing proliferation and soft agar colonization as well as inducing apoptosis. Oral administration of
cercosporamide to xenograft-bearing mice also effectively
inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation in xenografted tumor and
mouse liver tissues as quickly as 30 minutes after administration and, with daily oral dosing of cercosporamide
(20 mg/kg), significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneously implanted HCT116 human tumor xenografts.
Finally, in experimental metastasis assays with the B16
mouse melanoma model, cercosporamide administration
at 10 or 20 mg/kg significantly suppressed the outgrowth

Figure 4. Cercosporamide blocks eIF4E serine 209 phosphorylation in vivo, reduces tumor growth, and suppresses B16 melanoma metastases. A,
HCT116 xenograft-bearing nude mice were dosed once with cercosporamide p.o. by gavage (20 mg/kg). Xenograft tumor and mouse liver tissues were
harvested at the indicated times postdose to evaluate eIF4E serine 209 phosphorylation by Western blotting. Companion blots were also run for total eIF4E
protein. All blots were reprobed for b-actin to control for protein loading and transfer. B, HCT116 xenograft-bearing nude mice were dosed daily (20 mg/kg) for
30 days by gavage with cercosporamide. Tumors were measured twice weekly. Data shown represent tumor volumes at each measured time-point divided by
initial tumor volume for each animal (T1/T0)  SEM. Cercosporamide significantly suppressed HCT116 xenograft growth (P < 0.05, repeated measures
analyses). Data are representative of 2 separate xenograft efficacy studies. C, nude mice were inoculated by tail vein injection with B16 melanoma cells.
Starting 24 hours later, mice were treated 12 consecutive days p.o. by gavage with cercosporamide 10 mg/kg twice daily or 20 mg/kg. After 12 days, mice were
killed to harvest lungs and count pigmented metastases. Data are shown as percent of vehicle treated controls  SEM and represent 4 independent
experiments. Inset- representative photomicrographs of lungs from mice treated with vehicle or cercosporamide (20 mg/kg).

of experimental pulmonary metastases without substantially
altering mouse body weight.
Mnk can be activated as a downstream consequence of both
ERK and p38MAPK signaling (7, 37). Mnk can interact directly
with eIF4G and can, as a consequence of this association with
the eIF4F complex, phosphorylate eIF4E at serine 209 (5, 6).
This phosphorylation event has been associated with
increased protein synthesis, cellular proliferation, survival,
and malignant transformation in multiple experimental systems (17, 38–40). eIF4E phosphorylation has been the focus for
these studies as eIF4E is the most extensively studied substrate of Mnk particularly with respect to malignancy. However, there are other Mnk substrates, including sprouty (41),
cPLA2 (42) and hnRNPA1 (7, 43). How these proteins may be
affected by Mnk in relation to malignancy is currently unclear
and will be the subject of future experimentation.

The data provided in this manuscript reveal that cercosporamide is a potent Mnk inhibitor with selectivity for Mnk2.
These data also show that cercosporamide is orally bioavailable, thus enabling pharmacologic inhibition of Mnk in experimental animal models of cancer. Indeed, cercosporamide
treatment effectively inhibited phosphorylation of eIF4E in
vivo, blocked xenograft tumor growth and suppressed the
outgrowth of experimental pulmonary metastases. These data
demonstrate the utility of this compound in probing Mnk
function in vitro and in vivo and highlight the potential
anticancer therapeutic utility of suppressing Mnk function.
Moreover, exploring the activity of cercosporamide, as well as
the inhibitors of translation initiation such as ribavirin (27),
the 4E-ASO (25), or 4E-G1 (28), in a range of preclinical cancer
models may ultimately elucidate which approach to targeting
translation initiation might be most promising.
