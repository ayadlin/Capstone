Abstract:

Tumorigenesis occurs due to synergistic interactions from a complex of signal
transduction processes, including multiple onco-proteins and tumor suppressors
such as Ras, Myc, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Her-2/Neu, p53 and PTEN. Specifically, the
PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways have been shown to play a pivotal role on the
initiation and progression of malignancies, enhancing cell survival by stimulating
cell proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, it is critical to examine
therapeutic agents that explicitly target both the PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling
cascades in diseases, such as Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), that harbor
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We demonstrated that dual targeting of
the PI3K and mTOR pathways by the novel inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, exhibited
toxicity on WM cells by directly targeting the tumor clone and indirectly through
an effect on the bone marrow milieu. These findings suggest that dual targeting
of the PI3K and mTOR pathways is a better modality of targeted therapy for
tumors that harbor activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathways, such as in WM.

Introduction

to promote cell proliferation and survival, and regulates
multiple signaling pathways that maintain cell cycle,
proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis such as BAD,
caspases, IKK, GSK3, Forkhead-related transcription
factor 1 (FKHR1), eNOS, and mTOR [4,7,8]. The
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase leads
to cell growth and proliferation [9]. mTOR exists in two
distinct functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.
mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive) consists of mTOR
and Raptor; its activation results in phosphorylation of
p70S6 and 4E-BP1. mTORC2 consists of mTOR and the
rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), and
it results in Akt phosphorylation [10-13].
We have previously shown that targeting mTOR
leads to significant clinical activity in these patients
with up to 45% having partial remission when treated
with a TORC1 inhibitor (RAD001, Novartis, NJ) [14].
However, patients did not have a complete remission,
which indicates a mechanism of resistance to TORC1
exists in WM. Subsequently, we inquired as to whether
dual inhibition of PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways could

Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare,
low-grade, IgM secreting, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma,
characterized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic cells
in the bone marrow and IgM secretion in the peripheral
blood. We have recently demonstrated that primary WM
cells present with a constitutive activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway, sustained by decreased expression of PTEN
at the gene and protein levels, together with constitutive
activation of Akt and mTOR, PI3K-downstream signaling
cascades [1]. It has been clearly demonstrated that
PI3K pathway plays a pivotal role on the initiation and
progression of malignancies, enhancing cell survival by
stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis [26]. Signaling begins with the activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs). Upon activation by a ligand, RTKs engage
and activate PI3K, which in turn converts membranebound phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphonate (PIP2)
to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphonate (PIP3).
PIP3 then activates Akt by phosphorylation [7,8]. Akt acts

potentially show higher cytotoxic activity in WM cells
compared to PI3K or mTOR inhibitors alone, and found
that dual targeting of the PI3K and mTOR pathways
by the novel inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 exhibited higher
cytotoxicity on WM cells compared to inhibition of the
PI3K or mTOR pathways alone.

Rational for testing the dual
PI3K/Akt and mTOR inhibitor in
WM cells

The efficacy of the dual NVP-BEZ235 in targeting
Akt and mTOR pathways cells has been recently proven
in WM cells, as well as in other IgM-secreting lowgrade lymphoma cell lines, where the compound was
able to specifically inhibit phosphorylation of Akt, and
downstream GSK3α/β and ribosomal protein S6 in a dose
dependent manner in the WM cells, together with inhibited
phosphorylation of mTOR, as well as of the downstream
targets p70S6 and 4EBP1. In addition, inhibition of both
Akt and mTOR kinase activities were also documented.
mTOR represents a large protein kinase that exists as two
different entities within cells: one that contains mTOR
and raptor and another containing mTOR and rictor.
The raptor-mTOR complex is sensitive to the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin, while the rictor-containing complex
is rapamycin-insensitive [4-6] Notably, NVP-BEZ235
has been able to target both rictor and raptor in the context
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes indicating that this
may result in down-regulating the rictor positive feedback
loop on Akt activation [6]. Moreover while rapamycin
inhibited raptor and did not target rictor, leading to
phospho(p)-Akt up-regulation, NVP-BEZ235 induced
significant p-Akt inhibition resulting from the dual
targeting of both rictor and raptor. Interestingly, NVPBEZ235 was equally or more effective in downregulating
the mTOR-downstream targeted proteins p-p70S6 and
p-4EBP1 compared to either PI3K or mTOR inhibitors
when used alone.

Reduced expression of PTEN appear to be one of
the different genetic aberrations that leads to PI3K/Akt
activation, responsible for fundamental cellular processes
linked to tumorigenesis, such as cell-cycle regulation, cell
proliferation and survival, cell adhesion and migration,
and angiogenesis [7,8,15,16]. We identified that the
expression of PTEN at gene level and protein level is
lower in WM patients compared to control CD19+ cells.
PTEN inactivating mutation or altered methylation status
have not been described in WM, suggesting the possible
role of epigenetics in silencing PTEN expression. For
example, low PTEN levels could result from the deregualted expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs
constitute a class of small, non-coding, 18-24 nucleotide
RNAs, described for the first time in the nematode
Caenorabditis elegans [17]. To date, more than 300
miRNAs have been discovered in humans [18]. miRNAs
act as negative regulators of gene expression by binding
to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNAs
with partial sequence complementarity and leading to
translational repression [19]. By repressing several target
mRNAs, mature miRNAs play a pivotal role in regulating
development, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cell
proliferation [20]. We have previously performed miRNA
profiling in WM [21], and found that miRNA-494 and
-542-3p are over-expressed in WM patients as compared
to the normal cellular counterpart, suggesting a possible
role of miRNAs in silencing PTEN gene expression, since
PTEN represents a predicted target for both miRNA-494
and -542-3p.
It is known that PTEN acts as negative regulator
of Akt and mTOR [7], therefore, we subsequently
confirmed that primary WM cells present with higher
p-Akt and downstream p-mTOR protein levels compared
to their normal cellular counterpart together with a higher
expression of rictor and raptor, two different components
of the protein kinase mTOR. These findings provide the
biological preclinical evidence for testing a dual PI3K/
Akt and mTOR inhibitor in tumors harboring constitutive
activation of PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling cascades,
such as WM.

NVP-BEZ235-dependent inhibition
of Akt and mTOR signaling
cascades leads to toxicity in WM
cells, supported by induction of
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
in treated cells
It is known that both PI3/Akt and mTOR pathways
regulate cell growth and proliferation [22-25]; recent report
indicates the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 in inducing toxicity
and reducing DNA synthesis in WM cells, supported by
caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage.
Moreover, NVP-BEZ235 induced down-modulation of
the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, with an increased release
of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases
(Smac/DIABLO) from the mitochondria to the cytosol. In
addition, inhibition of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(c-IAP) was observed in WM cells exposed to dual

inhibition of PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways, based on
the ability of Smac/DIABLO to abrogate the protective
effects of IAPs [26]. In addition, NVP-BEZ235 has been
shown to target forkhead box (FoxO) transcription factors,
leading to cell cycle arrest in WM cells. Several reports
indicate that FoxOs represent down-stream effectors
of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and that phosphorylation of
AKT leads to nuclear export and cytoplasm retention of
phosphorylated FoxOs, with consequent inhibition of their
transcriptional activity [27,28]. Notably, NVP-BEZ235treated cells presented with inhibition of AKT-dependent
p-FoxO1/O4/O3 expression; together with up-regulation
of cell cycles inhibitors p27kip1 and p21waf1, leading to G1
cell cycle arrest and reduction of the S phase in WM cells
exposed to the dual PI3K/Akt and mTOR inhibitor.

Dual inhibition of PI3K/Akt
and mTOR pathways results in
targeting WM cells even in the
context of bone marrow milieu
It is important to highlight the role of NVP-BEZ235

in targeting lymphoplasmacytic WM cells in the context
of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. BM milieu is
represented by several cytotypes, including endothelial
cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, macrophages,
and others that have been demonstrated to support tumor
growth and to induce drug resistance in malignant cells
[24,29]. Notably, the anti-tumor activity of NVP-BEZ235
against WM cells in the context of the BM milieu has
been tested and validated both in vivo and in vitro. By
co-culturing WM cells and primary BM stromal cells
isolated from patients with WM, we have demonstrated
that NVP-BEZ235 abrogated BMSC adhesion-induced
phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR in WM cells, indicating
that NVP-BEZ235 exerts its anti-tumor activity even when
WM cells were in contact with the BM milieu. Importantly,
dual inhibition of PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways targeted
rictor and raptor in WM cells, even when cultured in
presence of BMSCs which induced up-regulation of raptor
but not rictor. In addition, NVP-BEZ235 has been proven
to inhibit adhesion and migration of WM cells to BMSCs,
supported by inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion
kinase, paxillin and cofilin, important proteins which act

significant inhibition of WM cells homing to the BM in
vivo. A schematic representation of NVP-BEZ235 effects

Primary WM cells show constitutive activation
of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways, supported by
decreased expression of PTEN. We have recently
demonstrated that dual targeting of the PI3K and mTOR
pathways by the novel inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 exhibited
higher cytotoxicity on WM cells compared to inhibition
of the PI3K or mTOR pathways alone, leading to WM
cell toxicity, even when WM cells are cultured in the
presence of BMSCs, both in vitro and in vivo. These
studies therefore show that dual targeting of the PI3K and
mTOR pathways is a better modality of targeted therapy
for tumors that harbor activation of the PI3K/mTOR
pathway, such as in WM.
