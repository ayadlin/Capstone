Metastases in Immune-Mediated Dormancy: A New
Opportunity for Targeting Cancer
Irene Romero1,2, Federico Garrido1,2,3, and Angel M. Garcia-Lora1,2

Abstract
The aim of any anticancer treatment is to avoid, control, or eliminate disseminated tumor cells. Clinical and
experimental evidence has revealed that metastases can remain in a latency state, that is, metastasis dormancy.
Three mechanisms are thought to be involved in cancer dormancy: cellular dormancy, angiogenic dormancy, and
immune-mediated dormancy. Here, we review the mechanisms and cells involved in immune-mediated cancer
dormancy and discuss current and future immunotherapeutic strategies. Recent results indicate that the immune
system can restrain disseminated cancer cells, promoting their permanent dormancy. CD8þ T lymphocytes play a
relevant role in maintaining immune equilibrium with metastatic dormant cells, and MHC class I surface
expression on tumor cells may also be involved. Natural killer (NK) cells have an activator function that triggers a
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Furthermore, immune dormancy promotes cancer cell growth arrest and
angiogenic control. Immunotherapeutic interventions in metastatic dormancy may help to control or eradicate
cancer disease. Treatments that activate or increase the CTL immune response or reverse cancer cell–induced
CTL immunosuppression might be useful to restrain or destroy metastatic cells. These objectives may be achieved
by recovering or increasing MHC class I surface expression on cancer cells or even by activating NK cells. Immunemediated metastasis dormancy provides an opportunity for targeting cancer in novel immune treatments. Cancer

Introduction
In cancer progression, the migration and invasion of tumor
cells to other organs is a fatal stage that may end with the onset
of overt metastases and the death of patient. It is well established that the clinical detection or not of metastases determines the prognosis of the patient. However, many patients
with no detectable metastases at the diagnosis develop overt
metastases or primary tumor relapse some months, years, or
even decades later. This latency period, during which cancer
cells do not grow or progress and remain occult in a quiescent
or equilibrium state, is known as "cancer dormancy". In these
patients, disseminated tumor cells (DTC) can remain in a
latent state as micrometastases, designated "dormant metastases". The dormancy of tumor and metastatic cells has been
widely reported in human patients and in preclinical animal
models (1). It usually occurs during metastatic progression,
and its duration varies among different cancers or even

between different types of the same cancer. Thus, metastases
are normally detected within 5 years of surgery in patients with
breast cancer with HER2þ or triple-negative tumors but after
10 or even 20 years after surgery in those with ERþ breast
cancer (2, 3). A latency period of 10 to 15 years is also frequently
reported in patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma (4,
5), whereas the median postsurgical interval before metastasis
detection exceeds 15 years in prostate cancer (6). The above
clinical data suggest that dormant DTCs may cause metastatic
relapse and that targeting them may be an effective anticancer
treatment. Some mathematical models have shown dormancy
to be a state of equilibrium that can persist for long time
periods or even indeﬁnitely, whereas others conclude that the
state of equilibrium must end, with the escape or complete
destruction of the cancer cells (7, 8). Both propositions have
been supported by experimental data found in human and
animal cancers. Thus, disseminated metastatic cells have also
been found to remain in permanent dormancy throughout the
life of animals, and autopsies of humans have detected small
tumors or metastatic nodules that had remained in dormancy
(9, 10).
Hence, dormancy is a well-documented stage in cancer
progression, during which cancer cells are controlled and
maintained in a latent state. Therapies designed to extend
this period, destroy dormant cancer cells, or revert progressing
cancer cells to a dormant state represent a promising approach
against cancer. The design of such treatments requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer dormancy, and some progress has been achieved in this respect
over recent years.

Targeting Metastases in Immune-Mediated Dormancy

Mechanisms Involved in Cancer Dormancy
Considerable research has been devoted to the characterization of dormant DTCs, to the mechanisms involved in
maintaining a nonexpanding state, and to the transition
between dormancy and metastatic relapse. When a patient is
diagnosed with cancer, solitary dormant tumor cells and
dormant micrometastases might be present in multiple
organs. The following mechanisms have been reported to
underlie dormancy: cellular dormancy, through mitotic arrest
or a balance between proliferation and apoptosis mediated by
interaction between the microenvironment and residual cancer cells, angiogenic dormancy, and immune-mediated dormancy (1, 11, 12). The ﬁrst two mechanisms have been extensively reviewed (13) and are only brieﬂy discussed here. The
present review focuses on immune-mediated metastatic dormancy, discussing the mechanisms and immune cells involved
and identifying possible immunotherapy treatments to eliminate residual metastatic cells or maintain them in permanent
immune dormancy.
Cellular dormancy and angiogenic dormancy
The interaction of solitary tumor cells with the different
microenvironments and extracellular matrices encountered in
secondary organs may determine their expansion or latency.
Various authors have observed that the invasiveness of tumor
cells is increased by the binding of urokinase plasminogen
activator (uPA) to its receptor (uPAR) on their surface (14, 15).
Conversely, a reduction in uPAR expression results in G0–G1
arrest and disrupts the uPAR complex, increasing p38 signaling
(negative regulator of angiogenesis) and dormancy is promoted by a low ERK/p38 ratio. Thus, suppression of p38 activity in
dormant tumor cells restored their proliferation (16). In addition, reduced PI3K–AKT signaling has been reported to play a
role in DTC quiescence (17). The development of new blood
vessels is required for this restoration of proliferation, and the
shift from an anti- to pro-angiogenic microenvironment, the
so-called "angiogenic switch", is considered a key factor in the
transition to a clinically aggressive cancer (12, 18). In this
regard, Achilles and colleagues reported that human cancers
contain subpopulations of tumor cells that vary in their
angiogenic ability (19). Thus, transfection of nonangiogenic
human tumor cells with an activated Ras oncogene was found
to produce a transition to the angiogenic phenotype in a mouse
model of human osteosarcoma dormancy (18). Other experimental studies have demonstrated that DII4 and Notch3 play a
role in angiogenic dormancy (20, 21). The two mechanisms
mentioned above (quiescence and angiogenesis) have been
demonstrated in local tumors in immunodeﬁcient mice; however, it is not clear whether growth arrest and angiogenic
dormancy take place during metastatic progression in
humans, largely due to the difﬁculty of detecting and isolating
dormant micrometastases in patients with cancer.
Immune-mediated dormancy
The direct involvement of the immune system in maintaining cancer cells in dormancy is supported by clinical and
experimental evidence. There is a higher incidence of cancer

www.aacrjournals.org

in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments (22),
and there are reports of the nonintentional transplant of an
occult tumor to an immunosuppressed host, suggesting that it
had remained dormant for some years (23). DTCs in a dormant
state have been observed in bone marrow from patients with
breast cancer, which also showed a rise in several immune
subpopulations, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes, with increased expression markers
of activation, proliferation, costimulation, and memory (24).
All of these ﬁndings strongly suggest that the immune system
recognizes these DTCs and that memory T lymphocytes
migrate to the bone marrow in humans to control these
dormant cancer cells. Similar data were observed in a mouse
lymphoma model, in which a small number of tumor cells
persisted in the bone marrow along with an increase in
memory T cells (25, 26). In patients with B-cell lymphoma,
therapy with monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies alone or
in combination with cytokine or chemotherapy was found
to promote tumor regression for long time periods, but persistent malignant cell clones in dormant stage were detected in
these patients (27). These results are in line with experimental
ﬁndings using a B-cell lymphoma 1 model (BCL-1) in BALB/c
mice, in which 70% of mice immunized with anti-idiotype
vaccine before BCL-1 cell injection remained asymptomatic
but with persistence of dormant BCL-1 cells (28). In further
assays, CD8þ T cells and IFNg were found to maintain these
cells in dormancy (29). In addition, mice preimmunized with
mitomycin C-treated or irradiated L5178Y lymphoma cells
elicited a strong protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)mediated response that kept L5178Y tumor cells in a dormant
state in the peritoneal cavity (30). A study by Eyles and
colleagues in RET.AAD mice found that CD8þ T cells were
involved in controlling the growth of early-disseminated melanoma cells (31). In a mouse model of chemically induced
carcinogenesis, Koebel and colleagues found that adaptive
immune components (e.g., CD4þ and CD8þ T lymphocytes,
IFNg, and IL12) are involved in controlling the state of equilibrium between primary tumor cells and the immune system
(32). In this model, IL23 and IL12 directly participate in
maintaining this equilibrium but in opposite directions, with
the former promoting cancer persistence and the latter preventing cancer outgrowth (33). A related issue is whether direct
immunosuppression by tumor cells might also promote escape
from the state of equilibrium. A recent study examined the
immune microenvironment proﬁle in primary chemically
induced murine sarcomas and reported that the equilibrium
state was maintained by a balance between immunosuppressive cells, especially myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
and Treg cells and antitumor immunity cells (CTLs, NK cells,
and gdT cells). The duration of this state of equilibrium largely
depended on the CD8þ/CD4þ and CD8þ/Treg cell ratios
among the immune cells that inﬁltrate the tumor microenvironment (34). This result is consistent with previous reports in
human colon and ovarian cancer that CD8þ tumor-inﬁltrating
lymphocytes and high CD8þ/Treg cell ratios are associated
with increased survival (35, 36). MDSCs can increase Treg cells,
suppressing T-cell activation and cytotoxicity, and may even
sustain tumor growth by protecting a fraction of proliferating

tumor cells from senescence (37). In a DA1-3b mouse model of
tumor dormancy, the hosts were vaccinated with DA1-3b cells
expressing CD40L or IL12 before the injection of parental DA13b cells, and a fraction of these mice did not develop leukemia
but harbored dormant leukemic cells (38). It was observed that
these cells escaped dormancy through an immunosuppressive
mechanism in which B7-H1 and B7-1 receptors are overexpressed, indicating a direct involvement of CD8þ T lymphocytes in maintaining the dormant state (39). Furthermore,
regulatory B cells might promote escape from dormancy by
inhibiting antigen presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages. In this context, the presence of cancer-related autoantibodies in the serum or tumor microenvironment of
patients with cancer is associated with a poor prognosis
(40). Taken together, these data suggest that the balance
between immune effector cells and suppressor immune cells
may inﬂuence the fate of a tumor.
A novel preclinical model of permanent immunemediated metastatic dormancy
Knowledge of the participation of the immune system in the
evolution of the cancer to metastases is very limited. Most of
the research data derive from immunodeﬁcient mice models,
in which the role of the immune system cannot be investigated,
or from the study of experimental metastases in animal
models, which do not resemble the metastatic process in
humans. In vivo metastatic models need to recapitulate the
distinct stages of the disease, the microenvironment, and the
presence of an autologous immune response. It took our group
more than two decades of research using a cancer murine
model of spontaneous metastases to study the characteristics
and mechanisms of the metastatic process. We recently
reported a novel preclinical cancer model of permanent
immune-mediated metastatic dormancy (10). The original
cancer murine model comprises different clone cell lines
derived from a methylcholanthrene-induced ﬁbrosarcoma and
cell lines derived from the spontaneous metastases obtained
with each of these clones (41). We found an elevated spontaneous metastatic capacity in tumor clones that were highly
positive for MHC-I and no metastatic capacity in MHC-I–
negative clones and mice with the latter remained metastasisfree throughout their life (10, 42). We expected MHC-I–negative GR9-B11 tumor cell clone to lack migratory and invasive
capacities, but when we repeated the same spontaneous
metastasis assays in immunodeﬁcient mice, a large number
of overt pulmonary metastases appeared in all of the animals
(10). Hence, the tumor cells were able to migrate and invade in
the absence of a T lymphocyte-mediated immune response.
The immune response was analyzed in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice, detecting an increase in T lymphocytes,
dendritic cells, and macrophages (10). We then investigated
whether this immune response destroyed DTCs or merely kept
them in a state of dormancy. Tumor-bearing mice were left for
4 months after primary tumor removal and then began to be
depleted of T lymphocytes or asialo-GM1 cells. The mice were
euthanized 3 months later, and complete necropsy revealed
overt pulmonary metastases in all mice depleted of CD8þ T
lymphocytes in 86% of those depleted of asialo-GM1þ cells, but

6752

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

in only 25% of the mice depleted of CD4þ T lymphocytes (10).
Tumor-bearing mice that were not immunodepleted remained
metastasis free throughout their lives (10). According to these
experimental animal data, spontaneous metastases can be
restrained in permanent dormancy by CD8þ T lymphocytes
and NK cells and, to a lesser extent, by CD4þ T lymphocytes
(Fig. 1). Numerous metastases were observed in nu/nu BALB/c
mice, despite their possession of large number of NK cells,
indicating an absence of direct cytotoxic action by these cells
(10). Furthermore, analysis of the immune response in tumorbearing immunocompetent mice free of overt metastases
found no increase in the number of NK cells, and only the
depletion of CD8þ cells promoted the onset of overt metastases
in all animals. It is therefore possible that NK cells may
promote the development of a CTL immune response independent of CD4þ cells. Hence, MHC-I–negative GR9-B11 cells
may activate NK cells, priming local dendritic cells and stimulating a strong protective response by CD8þ T cells. An
increased population of dendritic cells was observed in
GR9-B11–bearing mice (10). Given that the disseminated
metastatic cells recovered MHC-I cell surface expression,
they might be recognized and kept in dormancy by CD8þ T
lymphocytes (Fig. 1). The study of another highly metastatic
MHC-I–positive tumor clone in the same cancer model showed
that immunotherapeutic treatment of the host avoided metastatic colonization (43); however, depletion of T lymphocytes
after the immunotherapy promoted the awakening and growth
of dormant metastases, which colonized the lungs and caused
the death of these mice (unpublished observations).
Taken together, the above data demonstrate that CD8þ T
lymphocytes participate in the control of dormant spontaneous metastases (Fig. 1). The ﬁndings of our group suggest that
the interaction between MHC-I molecules on the cancer cell
surface and T-cell receptors may also play an important role in
dormancy. Schirrmacher and colleagues reported that a
tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed by a small population of dormant cancer cells in the bone marrow favors the
maintenance and high frequency of TAA-speciﬁc long-term
memory CD8þ T cells (25, 26). Interestingly, MHC-I surface
expression on these dormant tumor cells was upregulated with
respect to the parental tumor cells. Another key issue is
whether the dormant metastases in our model are in a quiescent state or in a state of equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell death. Cell lines derived from overt metastases
obtained after immunodepletion of the hosts presented in vitro
and in vivo proliferative capacity. These dormant metastatic
cells therefore appear able to maintain a certain proliferative
capacity. The possibility that the dormant metastatic cells
were cancer stem cells can be ruled out, because they did not
have the low expression of MHC-I molecules and high proliferative capacity characteristic of stem cells.
In most tumor models of dormancy in animals, the hosts are
transgenic mice with a predisposition to develop cancer or are
previously immunized with syngeneic tumor antigens/tumor
cells or treated with anticancer therapies. We emphasize that
the present dormant metastatic model is nontransgenic and
that the hosts do not receive any anticancer therapy and are
injected with nongenetically modiﬁed tumor cells. The model

also recapitulates all stages of human metastatic disease,
making it ideal for studying the mechanisms and cells involved
in immune-mediated metastatic dormancy.
Immune dormancy may promote cancer cell growth
arrest and angiogenic control
Various authors have proposed that immune cell–mediated
dormancy may require the induction of tumor cell growth
arrest and angiogenic control. Thus, Koebel and colleagues
reported that the state of equilibrium of the primary tumor
mass in a mouse model was characterized by a combination of
T-cell–mediated tumor cell rejection with increased apoptosis
and decreased proliferation of the tumor cells (low Ki67
expression; ref. 32). In an RET.AA model, Eyles and colleagues
found an association between the presence of DTCs in the lung
and a reduction in Ki67 positivity with respect to the primary
tumor (31). Muller-Hemerlink and colleagues reported that
Tag-speciﬁc Th1 cells induced antiangiogenic chemokines and
senescence in Tag-expressing tumor cells via IFNg and TNFR1
signaling (44). The CD4þ T-cell–mediated antitumor effects
observed were attributed to the release of the potent angiogenesis inhibitors CXCL9 and CXCL10 and to a reduced anb3
integrin expression. They also found that secreted IFNg and

www.aacrjournals.org

TNF arrested cancer cells in G0–G1 by stabilizing the
p16INNK4a-Rb pathway without inducing their death. This
cytokine-induced senescence required the combined action of
STAT1 and TNFR1 signaling (45). Moreover, IFN- and TNFinduced in vitro growth arrest in other types of murine and
human tumor cell lines (45). All of the above evidence suggests
that the antitumor immune response may induce dormancy
via nonimmune mechanisms.

Immunotherapeutic Interventions in Metastatic
Dormancy
The aim of anticancer therapies is to completely eradicate
the cancer clinically detected in a patient, avoiding tumor
primary recurrence and dissemination and the growth of
malignant cells at distant sites. As reported above, numerous
studies have described a state of equilibrium between dormant
metastatic cells and the anticancer immune response and have
shown that these dormant cells can develop escape mechanisms and progress (Fig. 1). The development of animal models
that closely mimic the immune-mediated dormant cancer
state is crucial for evaluating novel immunotherapeutic strategies. Knowledge of the mechanisms involved in cancer dormancy and immune escape may help to restrain or eradicate

these dormant micrometastases. Dormant disseminated metastatic cells have a very low proliferation rate or are quiescent
and are therefore not susceptible to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Furthermore, elevated chemotherapy and
radiotherapy doses can impair the immune system, which may
lead to the awakening of dormant cancer cells, whereas low
doses can induce immunogenic death and the host immune
response. Eradication of this small population of dormant
metastatic cells is a challenging task due to the difﬁculty of
their detection. In immune-mediated dormancy, immune cells
may be a vehicle for ﬁnding and destroying dormant cells or for
keeping them indeﬁnitely in latency, as in our model. It may
also be possible to revert progressing cancer cells to a stage of
permanent dormancy (Fig. 1).
CTL activation
As noted above, CTLs participate in metastatic dormancy
and may even restrain spontaneous metastases in permanent
dormancy. There may therefore be a role for immunotherapies
to promote CTL activation or reverse cancer cell–induced CTL
immunosuppression, including treatments to block immune
checkpoints such as the immunosuppressive receptors
expressed on cancer cells or on CTLs (CD80, CD86, PD-L1,
PD-1, CTLA-4; Fig. 1). In fact, various antibodies against PD-L1,
PD-1, and CTLA-4 are currently undergoing clinical trials
(nivolumab, MK-3475/MDPL3280A, MDX-1105), and the
anti–CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab is approved by FDA for
clinical use and has achieved highly promising outcomes.
Another possible approach would be to inhibit the signal
pathways involved in the surface expression of these immunosuppressive receptors or in their signal transduction pathways. In this respect, researchers have reported the involvement of JAK/STAT, MEK, PTEN, and PI3K pathways (46, 47).
The beneﬁts to patients may be enhanced by combining these
therapies. Recent clinical trials reported superior outcomes
with a combination of T-cell–activating anti–PD-1 (nivolumab) and anti–CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) monoclonal antibody
(mAb) than with each therapy alone (48). Other potentially
valuable strategies include immunotherapies designed to activate the CTL response, such as the adoptive transference of
lymphocytes, the activation, stimulation, or adoptive transference of dendritic cells, vaccination with tumor antigens or
treatment with CpG oligonucleotides.
Upregulation of MHC-I surface expression
Given that MHC-I–positive surface expression on tumor
cells may be involved in metastatic-immune dormancy, therapies designed to increase or recover MHC-I surface expression
on metastatic cells may be effective to keep them in dormancy
(Fig. 1). In cancer cells with reversible MHC-I defects (soft
lesions), it may be possible to recover MHC-I surface expression by treatment with IFN type I and II and/or TNFa or by
immunotherapies that promote the production of these cytokines (49). This approach offers the dual beneﬁt of a possible
increase in both MHC-I expression and CTL immune response.
An increase in MHC-I can be achieved with chemotherapy (e.g.,
5-aza-20 -deoxicytidine, anthracyclines, histone deacetylation
inhibitors) and with radiotherapy (50, 51). Loss of Fhit tumor

6754

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

suppressor gene expression was recently implicated in the
coordinated transcriptional downregulation of APM components, MHC-I heavy chains, and b2-microglobulin genes, leading to partial or total losses of MHC-I surface expression on
tumor cells (52). Hence, treatments to recover Fhit expression
(e.g., demethylating agents or Fhit gene transfection) may
also increase MHC-I surface expression in tumors with this
defect. In contrast, when MHC-I losses are caused by structural
defects (hard lesions) in MHC-I heavy chains, APM components, or b2-microglobulin genes, only transfection of the
corresponding wild-type gene would increase MHC-I surface
expression (49).
Balance between immune effector cells and
immunosuppressive cells
The aim of therapeutic strategies in immune cancer dormancy should be to maintain a positive balance between
immune effector cells and immunosuppressive cells. Thus,
treatments against immunosuppressive mechanisms may
include the destruction of Treg or MDSCs or the elimination
of IDO or adenosine (Fig. 1; ref. 53). However, caution must be
taken in administering immunosuppressive treatments to
transplantation patients or those with autoimmune disease
to avoid disrupting the dormant equilibrium state in favor of
progression of the cancer cells (33). Furthermore, given the
involvement of CTLs, IFNg, and IL12 in cancer cell dormancy,
immunosuppressive treatments that block them might trigger
the awakening of dormant cancer.
Intervention in the IL12/IL23 axis
As already mentioned, it was recently reported that IL12 and
IL23 may be responsible for controlling cancer outgrowth and
thereby maintaining primary tumors in dormancy (Fig. 1;
ref. 33). Stimulation of the production of IL12 through the
administration of anti-CD40 agonist (stimulator of IL12 production from APCs) has a protective effect on dormant primary
tumors, as also observed with the blockade of IL23 (33). A
combination of anti-IL23p19 and anti-CD40 therapies may be a
promising option for destroying dormant metastatic cells.
Clinical trials of anti-IL23 mAbs are ongoing for different
autoimmune diseases. In this regard, various studies found
that IL12-activated NK/NKT cells may regulate dendritic cells
via cell–cell contact and IFNg secretion (54). This interplay
between dendritic cells and NK cells may completely replace
CD4þ T induction of CTLs, providing an alternative pathway.
However, although the use of IL12 proved successful in numerous mouse models, clinical trials reported sporadic tumor
regression and severe adverse effects in humans (55, 56). There
is currently renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of
IL12, and several new clinical trials are under way on its
intratumoral administration as a means of avoiding toxic effects.
NK cell activation
The activation of NK cells is another possible approach. NK
cells play a signiﬁcant role in metastatic dormancy but through
an activator function rather than a direct cytotoxic activity.
There two options: maintaining NK cell activation to promote
or to extend dormant state or stimulating NK cells to destroy

Targeting Metastases in Immune-Mediated Dormancy

dormant metastatic cells. Treatment with protein-bound polysaccharide K increased the NK cell population, promoting the
entry into dormancy of progressing metastases derived from a
highly metastatic clone of GR9 (unpublished observations;
ref. 43). Saudemont and colleagues reported that vaccination
with CXCL10-transduced DA1-3b cells enhanced the NK
response, eradicating the minimal residual disease produced
by DA1-3b tumor cells, despite the expression of B7-H1 by these
cells and their resistance to activated CTLs (38).
Modifying the cancer microenvironment
There is a constant interaction between cancer cells and
host cells, and the tumor microenvironment plays important
roles in the progression, restraint, or destruction of cancer
cells. Anticancer therapies should target not only the cancer
cells but also their microenvironment. One line of attack
against DTCs is to identify organ-speciﬁc targets in their
microenvironment. Thus, disruption of the binding of a4
integrins to VCAM-1 has been proposed in potential therapies
against lung and bone metastases, and there are ongoing
clinical trials on the effects of a4 integrin inhibitors (57).
Another target in the tumor microenvironment is the microvasculature of potential metastatic niches. Zaho and colleagues recently reported that vaccination of HHD mice with
multiple tumor-associated blood vessel antigen-derived peptides produced a CD8þ T-cell–dependent regression of colon
carcinoma and melanoma and even provided long-term protection against disease relapse (58).
Combined therapies
The combination of vaccines with tumor cell antigens and
antiangiogenic agents (e.g., TKI, VEGF/VEGFR antagonist)
might improve the outcome of immunotherapy (59). Furthermore, combination therapies may be more effective, not
only due to their summative effect in destroying cancer cells
but also because a ﬁrst treatment can sensitize tumor cells
to a second treatment. Thus, Schreiber and colleagues found
that the administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
two days before adoptive T-cell immunotherapy achieved
the eradication of established tumors expressing low levels
of TAA by destroying their stroma. Antigen-loss tumor
variants were also abolished by this destruction of cancer
stroma (60). According to these results, changes induced in
the tumor microenvironment might favor the destruction of
dormant metastatic cells. Drugs such as cyclophosphamide,
paclitaxel, 5-ﬂuouracil, 5-axa-20 -deoxycitidine, mitomycin,
doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone have been found to activate
antitumor activity in mice in combination with immunotherapy, increasing antigenic presentation (61, 62). Treatment with vinblastine produced the maturation of dendritic
cells, inducing a CD8þ T-cell response (63), whereas 5ﬂuouracil, CPT-11, and cisplatin increased the susceptibility
of colon cancer cells to killing by CTLs (64). Further sensitization treatments that could be applied before immunotherapy include the administration of immune checkpoint
inhibitors and the recovery of MHC-I surface expression on
metastatic cells with low or negative expression. Therefore,
future clinical research should focus not only on testing new

www.aacrjournals.org

drugs or novel treatments but also on optimizing doses in
combined therapies.

Implications and Future Directions
All of the results and evidence presented here indicate
that the immune system may play a central role in metastatic dormancy (Fig. 1). An important function has been
revealed for CTLs, which are even capable of restraining
metastases in permanent dormancy. Hence, any anticancer
treatment, especially immunotherapy, aimed at maintaining,
promoting, or activating a CTL immune response or at
reversing CTL immunosuppression may be effective to
restrain or destroy metastases in dormancy or to revert
metastases to a dormant state (Fig. 1). MHC-I surface
expression on metastatic cells appears to play an important
role in this dormant equilibrium state. Consequently, treatments designed to recover or increase MHC-I surface
expression on DTCs may be useful to control these dormant
metastatic cells. NK cells are also involved in metastatic
dormancy through an activator function rather than a direct
cytotoxic function. Treatments inducing NK cell proliferation and activation may be valuable to modulate the CTL
response (Fig. 1). However, all these treatments and other
immunotherapeutic treatments should be used not only
after the onset of metastatic disease but also after the
removal of primary tumors in cancers in which minimal
residual disease is frequent (e.g., breast and prostate cancers, melanoma, lymphoma treated with anti-idiotype antibodies, and chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with
imatinib mesylate) and even when patients are in complete
remission. Moreover, when the initial treatment of patients
after primary tumor excision is chemotherapy or radiotherapy, this should be combined with or immediately followed
by immunotherapy to enhance the control of the immune
system over dormant metastatic cells. Thus, when we used a
highly metastatic clone in our cancer model, the complete
eradication of overt pulmonary spontaneous metastases was
promoted by a 4-month immunotherapy regimen immediately after primary tumor removal (43). Hence, immunotherapy treatments can control metastases that would progress in an untreated immunocompetent host. Periodic
immunotherapy treatments may be appropriate in some
patients with the aim of transforming their cancer into a
chronic nonfatal disease. However, caution must be taken in
administering immunosuppressive treatments to transplanted patients or those with autoimmune diseases to
avoid awakening dormant metastases. Immune-mediated
metastatic dormancy may be an important phenomenon in
cancer, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and
cells involved may help to design novel immune strategies
for the control or destruction of cancer cells.
