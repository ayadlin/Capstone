Abstract:

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades are often activated by
genetic alterations in upstream signaling molecules such as receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK). Integral components of these pathways, Ras, B-Raf, PI3K, and PTEN are
also activated/inactivated by mutations. These pathways have profound effects on
proliferative, apoptotic and differentiation pathways. Dysregulation of these pathways
can contribute to chemotherapeutic drug resistance, proliferation of cancer initiating
cells (CICs) and premature aging. This review will evaluate more recently described
potential uses of MEK, PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors in the proliferation of malignant
cells, suppression of CICs, cellular senescence and prevention of aging. Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways play key roles in the regulation
of normal and malignant cell growth. Inhibitors targeting these pathways have many
potential uses from suppression of cancer, proliferative diseases as well as aging.

Introduction

orchestrated events generally starting from the cell
surface and leading to controlled gene expression within
the nucleus. Regulation of these pathways is mediated by
a series of kinases, phosphatases and various exchange
proteins. Mutations occur in many of these pathway
elements leading to uncontrolled regulation and aberrant
signaling. An overview of the effects of mutations and
the activation of these signaling pathways is presented in
Figure 1. Deregulated signaling can lead to unrestrained
cellular growth and proliferation ultimately resulting
in tumor formation or abnormal cellular growth and
premature aging. As such, a great deal of research has
been aimed to target these mutated proteins to prevent
abnormal signaling [1-5].

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR signaling cascades have been extensively studied
over the past few decades. In this time there have been
breakthroughs in the discovery of pathway components,
the mechanisms by which they relay their signals and
how mutations of these components can lead to aberrant
signaling and uncontrolled proliferative diseases.
Research has also lead to the development of inhibitors
that specifically target critical elements of these pathways
in anticipation of ameliorating patient survival. This
review will discuss some of the current inhibitors, their
targets and how they are being used to treat cancer and
other proliferative diseases including aging.
Signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways are carefully

Figure 1: Dysregulated Expression of Upstream Receptors and Kinases Can Result in Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathway. Sometimes dysregulated expression of growth factor receptors occurs by increased

expression, genetic translocations or genomic amplifications which can lead to activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathways. Alternatively chromosomal translocations can occur in non-receptor kinases and other genes which result in activation of
these pathways. Genes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways that have activating mutations detected in human
cancer and proliferative diseases are indicated in blue ovals. Genes overexpressed in certain cancers are indicated in purple ovals. Tumor
suppressor genes mutated in human cancer are indicated in red rectangles. Other key genes are indicated in green ovals. Genes inactivated

Mutations or Altered Expression
of these Pathways Can Lead to
Sensitivity to Therapy.
Some cancer cells carrying BRAF mutations are
highly sensitive to MEK inhibitors, while cells lacking
these BRAF mutations or containing RAS or epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are resistant [5,
6]. Increased Akt activity may actually render cells and
patients sensitive to Akt as well as downstream mTOR
inhibitors. The formation of the rapamycin-sensitive
mTORC1 complex (consisting of mTOR, regulatory–
associated protein of mTOR [Raptor], DEPTOR and
mLST8) in certain cancer cells that overexpress activated
Akt may be altered in comparison to cells that do not
overexpress Akt. In cells that express activated Akt, Akt
may phosphorylate TSC-2 resulting in its inactivation.
The mTORC1 complex is formed and downstream p70S6K
and 4E-BP1 are phosphorylated, allowing the dissociation
of eIF-4E, ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Figure

contrast, in the absence of Akt activation, this complex
should not be formed. Rapamycin targets this complex;
hence the cells that express elevated levels of activated
Akt cells may be more sensitive to rapamycin than the
cancer cells that do not express high levels of activated
Akt. In the cells that do not express elevated levels
of activated Akt, this complex should be transiently
assembled after growth factor treatment. In contrast, the
assembly of the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 complex
(consisting of rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR
[Rictor], mTOR, DEPTOR, mLST8) should be lower in
the cells that express elevated levels activated Akt than
in those cells that do not as there is equilibrium between
the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. The significance
of these complex biochemical signaling events is that
cancer cells that overexpress activated Akt or lack
PTEN expression have an Achilles heel with regards to
therapeutic intervention as they are highly sensitive to
rapamycin treatment. An overview of the interactions

Figure 2: Rationale for Targeting Both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways for
Suppressing Cancer Growth. A: The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways are both activated by upstream
receptor ligation and frequently co-regulate many downstream targets in parallel. Thus for effective elimination of many cancers or prevention
of aging, it may be necessary to target both signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways could also result in increased transcription of
many genes that promote cellular growth and malignant transformation. B. Inhibition of mTOR can result in the induction of autophagy, which
is a very important mechanism of cell death, especially in solid tumors. C. As described previously, both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways regulate the activity of apoptotic proteins by post-translational mechanisms. Targeting this pathway may also
contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Signaling molecules promoting phosphorylation events are indicated in green. Stimulatory signaling
events are indicted in green lines with a green arrow before the target of the phophorylation. Small molecule inhibitors are indicated in red.
Inhibitory phosphorylation events are indicated in red lines with a block on the end before the target of the inhibition. Inhibitory signaling or

of patient survival [10].  The IC50 value for PLX-4720
is approximately 3-fold lower in in vitro kinase assays
with mutant versus WT B-Raf proteins and demonstrates
an approximately 60-fold lower IC50 value in vivo when
cell lines with mutant and WT BRAF genes are compared
[10]. The IC50 value for PLX-4720 was compared with
Sorafenib in a panel of melanomas, colon carcinomas
and NSCLC. The BRAF gene status was known in all
of these cell lines. The IC50 value for PXL-4720 was
approximately 100-fold lower (range: 17.5 to 280 nM)
than Sorafenib in melanomas and colon carcinomas that
had the BRAFV600E mutation; however, the IC50 value for
PLX-4720 was approximately the same as Sorafenib in
colon carcinomas and NSCLC without BRAF mutations,
but with RAS mutations [10]. PLX-4720 arrests mutant
but not WT B-Raf melanoma cells at the G0/G1 cell-cycle
stage and initiates apoptosis in these cells. The additional
B-Raf inhibitor (PLX-4032) developed by Plexxicon
shows promising effects [11].

Overview of Pathway Inhibitors
Effective inhibitors specific for many of the key
components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/mTOR pathways have been developed [7-35].
In many cases, these inhibitors have been examined in
clinical trials. Furthermore, inhibitors that target the
mutant but not the wild type (WT) alleles of various
genes (e.g., BRAF and PIK3CA) either have been or are
being characterized. Thus specific inhibitors have been
made and some are currently in the clinic. Targeting
some components of these pathways has proven clinically
effective and in some of the diseases have a very large
market with few effective treatments [(e.g., Sorafenib and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)] [7].

Raf/MEK Inhibitors

Need for Genetic
Before Treatment
Kinase Inhibitors.

Raf inhibitors have been developed and some are
being used for therapy while others are being evaluated
in clinical trials (See Table 1). Some inhibitors (i.e,
Sorafenib, Bayer) were initially thought to specifically
inhibit Raf but have been subsequently shown to have
multiple targets (e.g., VEGF-R, Flt-3, PDGF-R). However,
that does not preclude their usefulness in cancer therapy.
Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of certain cancers
(e.g., renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and patients with
unresectable HCC and is currently being further evaluated
in the Sorafenib Hepatocellular carcinoma Assessment
Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial, which demonstrated
that the drug was effective in prolonging median survival
and time-to-progression in patients with advanced HCC.
Sorafenib is generally well tolerated in HCC patients with
a manageable adverse events profile [7]. MEK inhibitors
have also been examined for treating HCC in mouse
models [8,9] but they do not appear to be as effective
as Sorafenib, most likely due to the broad specificity of
Sorafenib, which inhibits other targets besides Raf.
PLX-4720 (Plexxikon/Roche) (R7204) is a mutant
B-Raf specific inhibitor that has been used for preclinical
studies [10]. PLX-4032 is a B-Raf inhibitor that is being
evaluated in clinical trials. PLX-4720 was designed using
a unique screening platform developed by Plexxikon that
involved the use of structural and medicinal chemistry
techniques [10]. This more selective screening approach
has resulted in a series of B-Raf inhibitors based on the
structural implications of BRAF mutation and which
discriminate between the mutant and WT protein. PLX4720 is orally available and is highly selective for the
mutant B-Raf protein. PLX-4720 is effective against
melanomas, as well as colorectal tumors and other
cancers, with the BRAFV600E mutation. BRAFV600E has been
associated with more aggressive tumors and lower rates
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Screening
with Raf

It has recently become apparent that it will be critical
to determine the genetic status at both B-Raf and Ras
before treatment with B-Raf selective inhibitors [12]. Class
I B-Raf inhibitors (active conformation inhibitors) such as
(PLX4720 and 885-A, a close analog of SB590885) will
inhibit B-Raf mutants, however these ATP-competitive
B-Raf inhibitors will not inhibit WT B-Raf or mutant Ras.
In fact, these B-Raf inhibitors can activate Raf-1 in these
cells in the presence of active Ras. 885-A could induce
B-Raf binding to Raf-1. PLX-4720 can, to a lesser extent,
induce B-Raf binding to Raf-1 when the ERK-mediated
negative feedback loop on B-Raf was inhibited with a
MEK inhibitor. These binding events were determined
to require the present of activated Ras (WT or mutant),
which may be necessary for the translocation from
the cytoplasm to the membrane and assembly into the
signaling complex. This has therapeutic implications, as in
patients with mutant RAS, if they are treated with certain
B-Raf inhibitors, B-Raf can bind and activate Raf-1 and
promote the oncogenic pathway. In fact, even kinase-dead
BRAF mutations, which are observed in human cancer,
the mutant B-Raf proteins can dimerize with Raf-1,
when stimulated by the mutant Ras protein and activate
the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Clearly for B-Raf-selective
inhibitors to be therapeutically useful, prior screening of
patients for RAS mutations will be mandatory, as well as
perhaps additional screening during treatment. Otherwise
resistance may develop and lead to further stimulation of
the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.

MEK Inhibitors

Selumetinib did not prevent the activation of the related
ERK5 that occurs with some older MEK1 inhibitors,
which are not being pursued in clinical trials. Inhibition
of ERK1/2 suppresses their ability to phosphorylate and
modulate the activity of Raf-1, B-Raf and MEK1 but not
MEK2 as MEK2 lacks the ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation
site. In essence, by inhibiting ERK1/2 the negative loop
of Raf-1, B-Raf and MEK phosphorylation is suppressed
and hence there will be an accumulation of activated Raf1, B-Raf and MEK [24]. This biochemical feedback loop
may provide a rationale for combining Raf and MEK
inhibitors in certain therapeutic situations.
In colon, melanoma, pancreatic, liver and some
breast cancers, selumetinib inhibited the growth of tumors
in tumor xenograft studies performed in mice. The new
MEK inhibitors are also at least 10 to 100-fold more
effective than earlier MEK inhibitors and hence can be
used at lower concentrations [8, 9, 20-24]. Selumetinib
also inhibits the growth of human leukemia cells, but does
not affect the growth of normal human cells. Selumetinib
also suppressed the growth of pancreatic BxPC3 cells,
which do not have a known mutation in this pathway,
suggesting that this drug may also be useful for treating
cancers that lack definable mutations. However, it is
likely that BxPC3 cells have some type of upstream gene
mutation/amplification or autocrine growth factor loop
that results in activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Selumetinib induced G1/S cell-cycle arrest in colon
and melanoma cancer cell lines and activated caspase-3
and -7 in some cell lines (Malme3M and SKMEL2);
however, caspase induction was not observed in other
melanoma (SKMEL28) or colon cancer cell lines (HT29),
demonstrating that further research needs to be performed
with this inhibitor to determine if it normally induces
apoptosis and whether the induction of apoptosis can be
increased with other inhibitors or chemotherapeutic drugs.
Selumetinib suppressed the tumor growth of
pancreatic cells, such as BxPC3, in immunocompromised
mice more effectively than conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs, such as gemcitabine, which is commonly used to
treat pancreatic cancer; however, once treatment with
selumetinib was discontinued, the tumors regrew [21].
Most likely MEK inhibitors do not induce apoptosis, but
rather, they inhibit proliferation. That is, MEK inhibitors
are cytostatic.
An additional MEK inhibitor is PD-0325901
(Pfizer) [27-30], which follows on from the earlier MEK
inhibitors PD-98059 and PD-184352, both of which have
been extensively examined in preclinical investigations
to determine the role of MEK in various biochemical
processes. PD-184352 was the first MEK inhibitor to
enter clinical trials and it demonstrated inhibition of
activated ERK and anti-tumor activity in patients [25,26];
however, subsequent multicenter, phase II studies with
patients with diverse solid tumors did not demonstrate
encouraging results [27]. This was probably due to low

Specific inhibitors of MEK have been developed
(e.g., PD98059 (Pfizer), U0126 (DuPont), PD184352
[CI-1040] (Pfizer), PD0325901 (Pfizer), Selumetinib
(a.k.a., ARRY-142886, AZD6244) (Astra-Zeneca), and
RDEA119 (Ardea Biosciences) (See Table 1) [3, 8-9,
13-30]. MEK inhibitors differ from most other kinase
inhibitors as they do not compete with ATP binding
(non-ATP competitive), which confers a high specificity
[17]. Most MEK inhibitors are specific and do not inhibit
many different protein kinases [18] although as will
be discussed below, certain MEK inhibitors are more
specific than others. The crystal structures of MEK1 and
MEK2 have been solved as ternary complexes with ATP
and PD184352, and have revealed that both MEK1 and
MEK2 have unique inhibitor binding sites located on a
hydrophobic pocket adjacent to, but not overlapping with,
the ATP-binding site [19]. Furthermore, effective targeting
of MEK1/MEK2 is highly specific, as ERK1/ERK2 are
the only well-described downstream targets. A distinct
advantage of inhibiting MEK is that it can be targeted
without knowledge of the precise genetic mutation that
results in its aberrant activation. This is not true with
targeting Raf as certain Raf inhibitors will activate Raf and
also certain B-Raf specific inhibitors will not be effective
in the presence of Ras mutations as discussed above.
An advantage of targeting MEK is that the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a convergence point where a
number of upstream signaling pathways can be blocked
with the inhibition of MEK. For example, MEK inhibitors,
such as Selumetinib, are also being investigated for the
treatment of pancreatic cancers, breast cancers, and other
cancers such as hematopoietic malignancies, including
multiple myeloma [20-22].
Selumetinib inhibits MEK1 in vitro with an IC50
value of 14.1 ± 0.79 nM [23, 24]; it is specific for MEK1
as it did not appear to inhibit any of the approximately
40 other kinases in the panel tested. Selumetinib is not
competitive with ATP. Molecular modeling studies
indicate that selumetinib binds to an allosteric binding
site on MEK1/MEK2. The binding sites on MEK1/MEK2
are relatively unique to these kinases and may explain
the high specificity of MEK inhibitors. This binding
may lock MEK1/2 in an inactivate conformation that
enables binding of ATP and substrate, but prevents the
molecular interactions required for catalysis and access
to the ERK activation loop. In basic research studies,
treatment with the MEK inhibitor results in the detection
of activated MEK1/2 when the western blot is probed
with an antibody that recognizes active MEK1/2, while
downstream ERK1/2 will not appear activated with the
activation specific ERK1/2 antibody [24]. Selumetinib
inhibited downstream ERK1/ERK2 activation in in vitro
cell line assays with stimulated and unstimulated cells,
and also inhibited activation in tumor-transplant models.

oral bioavailability and high metabolism, which led to
plasma drug levels that were inadequate to suppress tumor
growth.
The newer PD-0325901 MEK inhibitor is an
orally-active, potent, specific, non-ATP competitive
inhibitor of MEK. PD-0325901 demonstrated improved
pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties compared
with PD-184352, including a greater potency for inhibition
of MEK, and higher bioavailability and increased metabolic
stability. PD-0325901 has a Ki value of 1 nM against
MEK1 and MEK2 in in vitro kinase assays. PD-0325901
inhibits the growth of cell lines that proliferate in response
to elevated signaling of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathways [27].
Clinical trials with PD-0325901 have documented some
successes and some adverse side effects [27-29]. Pfizer
has suspended it evaluation in clinical trials. This may
have resulted in part from the design of the clinical trials
as MEK inhibitors may not be appropriate to treat all types
of cancer. MEK inhibitors may be appropriate to treat only
those cancers that proliferate in response to activation of
the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [30-32]. Furthermore, it may
also be important to include a chemotherapeutic drug or
radiation treatment to induce death of the cancer cell.
Raf is also a key therapeutic target [31-34], which lies
upstream of MEK. Hence, targeting MEK is an approach
to target tumors containing activated RAF genes. The
BRAFV600E mutation is present in approximately 6 to 8%
of human cancers (overall). Interestingly, approximately
5% of lung cancers have mutations at BRAF which are not
at V600E [35]. The effects of PD-0325901 were examined
in conditional BRAFV600E tumor models where genetically
modified mice express normal B-Raf prior to Cre-mediated
recombination, after which they express B-RafV600E at
physiological levels [35]. When B-RafV600E was induced,
the mice developed lung tumors which could be inhibited
by PD-0325901 (25 mg/kg/day for approximately two
weeks, followed by 12.5 mg/kg/day for an additional
two weeks). In contrast, mice treated with vehicle alone
developed adenomas. This model indicates that in some
cases for MEK inhibitors to yield successful outcomes,
the therapy needs to include a cytotoxic drug, as the MEK
inhibitors are cytostatic and often as soon as the MEK
inhibitors are removed, the tumor may re-emerge.
There are few current effective therapies for HCC
[36-39]. Hence targeting signaling pathways activated
in HCC has been considered an approach to target HCC.
Human HCC tumors have higher expression and enhanced
activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 compared with adjacent
non-neoplastic liver [37]. Over-expression of activated
MEK1 in HCC HepG2 cells resulted in enhanced tumor
growth in vivo [38]. On the other hand, preclinical studies
have demonstrated the potential of MEK inhibition to
suppress hepatoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity
[9]. Huynh et al. recently reported that treatment of human
HCC xenografts with Selumetinib blocked ERK1/2
activation, reduced in vivo tumor growth, and induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis [9]. Moreover, targeting MEK with PD-0325901
had in vivo chemopreventive effects on HCC development
in an animal model employing TGF-α-transgenic mice in
which liver cancers were induced by diethylnitrosamine
treatment [39]. Therefore, MEK represents a potential
therapeutic target for HCC.
RDEA119 is a more recently described MEK
inhibitor developed by Ardea Biosciences [16]. It is a
highly selective MEK inhibitor that displays a >100-fold
selectivity in kinase inhibition in a panel of 205 kinases.
In contrast, in the same kinase specificity analysis, other
recently developed MEK inhibitors (e.g., PD0325901)
also inhibited the Src and RON kinases.
There are at least two ERK molecules regulated by
the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, ERK1 and ERK2. Little is
known about the differential in vivo targets of ERK1 and
ERK2. The development of specific ERK1 and ERK2
inhibitors is ongoing and may be useful in the treatment
of certain diseases such as those leukemias where elevated
ERK activation is associated with a poor prognosis (e.g.,
AML, ALL) [40, 41].
Some tumors are resistant to MEK inhibitors because
they contain EGFR, KRAS, PI3KCA or PTEN mutations
[6, 42, 43]. Some cells with EGFR or KRAS mutations are
resistant to MEK inhibitors since they can also activate
the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These studies, which
were performed in vitro with cells lines and in vivo using
xenografts, also demonstrated that PI3K activation and
PTEN inactivation were not always equivalent in terms
of inhibitor sensitivity. The authors suggested that a
possible reason for this phenomenon could be that PTEN
has other functions besides the regulation of Akt (e.g.,
protein phosphatase activity). Furthermore these studies
demonstrated that the combination of MEK and PI3K
pathway inhibitors could be an effective approach to treat
certain cancers that had activation of both pathways.
Only certain types of breast cancer are sensitive to
MEK inhibitors [43]. Breast cancers can be classified
into three types: luminal breast cancers which are
usually estrogen receptor positive and have a relatively
good prognosis and response rate to hormonal based
therapies, HER2-positive breast cancers which have a
poor prognosis if untreated but are initially responsive to
the HER2 targeting monoclonal antibody Herceptin, and
basal-like breast cancers which have a poor prognosis
and lack expression of HER2, estrogen and progesterone
receptors (referred to as “triple-negative”). Many basal
breast cancers express high levels of EGFR which results
in activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Hoeflich
and colleagues [43] found that basal cell breast cancers
expressed a Ras-like expression profile and tested their
hypothesis that these breast cancers could be sensitive
to MEK inhibitors, providing that they do not have
PI3KCA mutations or PTEN deletions. In contrast many
luminal and HER2-amplified tumors are resistant to MEK
inhibitors. They also determined that PTEN loss was a

inhibitor which can target both PI3K and mTOR as opposed
to treating patients with two inhibitors, that is one targeting
PI3K and one targeting mTOR. Perhaps the most obvious
benefit would be lowered toxicities. Treatment with a
single drug could have fewer side effects than treatment
with two separate drugs. The effects of unwanted Akt
activation by mTOR inhibition might be decreased upon
treatment with a dual kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, the
negative side effects of mTOR inhibition on the activation
of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway might be alleviated
with the PI3K inhibitor activity in the dual inhibitor.
There remains, however, considerable uncertainty about
potential toxicity of compounds that inhibit both PI3K
and mTOR enzymes whose activities are fundamental to a
broad range of physiological processes.
Some of the PI3K inhibitors such as Wortmannin
and LY294002 have been used extensively to investigate
the role of PI3K in various biological properties but these
compounds are not being clinically explored for multiple
reasons, including insolubility in aqueous solutions
and high toxicity. The modified wortmannin PX-866 is
undergoing clinical trials for advanced metastatic cancer
by Oncothyreon. GDC-0941 is in clinical trial for advanced
solid cancers by Genentech. XL-147 and XL-765 are in
clinical trials for advanced solid tumors by Exelixis and
Sanofi-Aventis. CAL-101, a PI3Kδ specific inhibitor, is in
clinical trials for hematological malignancies by Calistoga
Pharmaceuticals. NVP-BEZ235 is in Phase I/II clinical
trials for advanced cancer patients by Novartis.
Triciribine (API-2) inhibits phosphorylation in all
three Akt isoforms in vitro and the growth of tumor cells
overexpressing Akt in mouse xenograft models [45]. The
mechanism by which triciribine inhibits Akt activity is
unknown. Although no studies have been performed with
triciribine in preclinical AML models, the drug has been
used in a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced
hematologic malignancies, including refractory/relapsed
AML. Results from this trial evaluating triciribine
administered on a weekly schedule were encouraging
and demonstrated that the drug was well-tolerated, with
preliminary evidence of pharmacodynamic activity as
measured by decreased levels of activated Akt in primary
blast cells [55].  
The rapalogs have been extensively examined
in clinical trials of various cancers including: breast,
prostate, pancreatic, brain, leukemia, lymphoma multiple
melanoma, HCC, RCC and non small cell lung carcinomas
(NSCLC) [49-53]. The rapalogs Torisel and Afinitor are
now approved to treat patients with RCC (see below).
mTOR inhibitors initially demonstrated promise, as
PTEN is often deleted in various tumors; however, it has
been determined that the mTOR pathway has a complicated
feedback loop that actually involves suppression of
Akt; hence mTOR inhibitors would potentially activate
Akt in some cells [2]. When mTORC1 is suppressed by
rapamycin, there is increased mTORC2 activity which

negative predictor factor for response to MEK inhibitors.
Furthermore, treatment with MEK inhibitors often led
to an increase in activated Akt expression, providing the
rationale to examine the consequences of co-addition of
MEK and PI3K inhibitors. The authors also determined
that co-administration of MEK and PI3K inhibitors
enhanced killing of the certain breast cancers. Thus the
studies by Wee et al, and Hoeflich et al., have shown the
concept that elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR expression will
confer resistance to MEK inhibitors. These studies further
illustrate a central concept that we have been discussing
in this review which is the critical role of genetics in
determining the sensitivity to targeted therapy.
Other studies have also indicated that some
tumors with EGFR mutations are resistant to MEK
inhibitors. Mutations at the BRAF, KRAS, EGFR genes
or the chromosomal fusion between anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) and ROS tyrosine kinases are detected in
approximately 50% of NSCLC. NSCLC cells with BRAF
mutations where shown to be more sensitive to MEK
inhibitors than NSCLC with mutations in EGFR, KRAS, or
the chimeric fusion between ALK and ROS [6]. This was
determined by screening a large panel of cell lines (n=87)
and tumors (n=916). In this study, cells with mutations at
EGFR were resistant to MEK inhibitors. This may have
resulted from the ability of EGFR to activate the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway which as discussed below has
some crucial overlapping targets as the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway. NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations should
not be treated with MEK (or BRAF) inhibitors as the
respective therapies would be ineffectual.

PI3K/Akt/mTOR Inhibitors
Many PI3K inhibitors have been developed [44,
45]. These include: LY-294002 [Lilly], Wortmannin,
PX-866 [Oncothyreon], GDC-0941 [Genentech], CAL101 [Calistoga Pharmaceuticals], XL-147 and XL-765
[Exelixis and Sanofi-Aventis]. Some PDK1 inhibitors
have been described but they are not specific for PDK1
including OSU-03012 [Arno Therapeutics] and Celecoxib
[Pfizer]. Various Akt inhibitors have been developed [4648]. These include: A-443654 [Abbott Laboratories],
GSK690693 [GlaxoSmithKline], VQD-002 (a.k.a. API2, VioQuest Pharmaceuticals), KP372-1 [QLT, Inc] and
Perifosine [AEterna Zentaris/Keryx Biopharmaceuticals].
Inhibitors of downstream mTOR have been developed [4953]. These include: rapamycin [Wyeth-Pfizer, Sirolimus]
and modified rapamycins (rapalogs) (CCI-779, [Torisel,
Temsirolimus, Wyeth-Pfizer], AP-23573 [Ridaforolimus,
Ariad-Merck] and RAD001 [Afinitor, Everolimus,
Novartis]). Rapamycin and the modified rapalogs are
mTORC1 inhibitors. Some dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
have also been developed [42, 54]. These include: (NVPBEZ235 [Novartis] and PI-103).
There may be benefits to treating patients with an

receptors expressed on the particular cancer cells, whereas
the MEK inhibitor would specifically suppress the Raf/
MEK/ERK cascade which is abnormally activated by
the BRAF oncogene or other mutant upstream signaling
molecules. To improve the effectiveness of Sorafenib
in the therapy of melanoma, it is being combined with
standard chemotherapeutic drugs (see below).
Sorafenib, unlike more novel kinase inhibitors
that target the mutant versus WT kinase, binds both the
WT and mutant V600E B-Raf proteins and retarded the
growth of melanoma xenografts in mice [33, 60, 61].
Other more recently developed Raf kinase inhibitors may
show higher selectivity toward the mutant as opposed to
WT Raf proteins [10, 11].

is the elusive PDK2 that serves to phosphorylate and
activate Akt. mTOR can also be regulated by the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway and mTOR can activate the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway. This may be another relevant crosstalk between the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and the Ras/PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathways, and might offer a further rationale
for treatments combining drugs that inhibit both signaling
networks. As mentioned earlier, combination of these
novel “dual” inhibitors with either a Raf or MEK inhibitor
might lead to more effective suppression of cancer growth.
In addition, it is now emerging that, at least in
some cell types, rapamycin does not inhibit 4E-BP1
phosphorylation. Small molecules designed for inhibiting
the catalytic site of mTOR have shown promising effects
on suppression of signalling downstream of mTOR
[56, 57]. The development of mTOR specific kinase
ATP-competitive inhibitors is currently under intense
investigation.

Selumetinib is an orally-active MEK1 inhibitor that
has undergone phase II clinical trials. It is one of the first
MEK1 inhibitors to be evaluated in randomized phase II
trials [3, 13, 20-22, 27]. Selumetinib has demonstrated
significant tumor suppressive activity in preclinical
models of cancer, including melanoma, pancreatic, colon,
lung, liver and breast cancer. The effects of Selumetinib
are enhanced significantly if the tumor has a mutation
that activates the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
Selumetinib shows great promise in the treatment of
pancreatic cancers, which often have mutations in Ras
that can lead to downstream Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
activation. Due to the frequent detection of pancreatic
cancer at advanced stages, it may be necessary to combine
signal transduction inhibitor therapy with conventional
chemotherapy after surgical removal of the pancreatic
cancer if possible.
Selumetinib has undergone several phase I and II
clinical trials. A phase I clinical trial to assess the safety,
tolerability and pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in
patients with various solid malignancies was performed.
Phase II clinical trials have compared: (i) the efficacy
of selumetinib versus temozolomide in patients with
unresectable stage 3 or 4 malignant melanomas, (ii) the
efficacy and safety of selumetinib versus capecitabine in
patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer
who have failed to respond to gemcitabine therapy, (iii)
the efficacy and safety of selumetinib compared with
pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who have previously
failed to respond to one or two prior chemotherapy
regimens, and (iv) the efficacy and safety of selumetinib
versus capectiabine in patients with colorectal cancer who
have failed to respond to one or two prior chemotherapy
regimens [62]. Initial results from clinical trials have
not yielded overwhelming support for the use of MEK
inhibitors (see below) as a single therapeutic agent in
cancer patients who are not pre-screened for pre-existing

Due to the broad specificity of Sorafenib
(NexavarTM), this drug has been evaluated for the therapy
of diverse cancers, including RCC, melanoma and HCC
(due to the involvement of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade,
as well as altered VEGR pathway in these cancers) and
gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (due to the
involvement of c-Kit mutations in this cancer) [58-61].
Sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of kidney
cancer, including RCC [59]. BRAF is not mutated in
RCC, however, VEGFR-2 may be aberrantly expressed as
there is dysregulation of its cognate ligand VEGF which
can activate VEGFR2 and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.
Sorafenib is active as a single agent in this disease,
probably due to its ability to suppress the activities of
multiple signaling pathways activated in RCC, which are
required for growth.
As the BRAF gene is mutated in approximately 60
to 70% of melanomas, Sorafenib was tested for its ability
to suppress melanoma growth in mouse models [60, 61].
The overwhelming majority of BRAF mutations occur at
V600E. Sorafenib had only modest activity as a single
agent in advanced melanoma and it did not appear to be
more effective in the treatment of melanomas that are
either WT or mutant at the BRAF gene, hence it may be
targeting a kinase other than B-Raf in these melanomas
(e.g., VEGFR). Alternatively, it could be targeting an
upstream receptor kinase which signals through the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. It is relevant to examine the
effects of combining Sorafenib with a MEK inhibitor
to treat malignant melanoma and certain other cancers.
Sorafenib may target the VEGFR and other membrane

activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [27, 28]. The
proper pre-identification of cancer patients who display
activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may be
necessary for prescribing MEK inhibitors as part of their
therapy, as we have stated previously that MEK inhibitors
are cytostatic and not cytotoxic.

Recent studies have demonstrated that mTOR inhibition
has remarkable activity against a wide range of human
cancers in vitro and human tumor xenograft models. The
mTOR pathway is known to be up-regulated in a subset of
HCC patients [64]. In this study 15% of HCC displayed
overexpression of phospho-mTOR, whereas 45% of HCC
had increased expression of p70S6K, which correlated with
tumor nuclear grade. Evidence from in vitro experiments as
well as from preclinical in vivo data indicated that mTOR
inhibition by rapamycin and its analogues everolimus
(RAD001) significantly reduced the growth of HCC
cells and improved survival primarily via antiangiogenic
effects [64-67]. A pilot study conducted in 21 patients

Figure 3: Conceptual Overview of Targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways to
Suppress Malignant Growth. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can interact at many different levels. In

this diagram, we have focused on how they interact to regulate mTOR, p70S6K and protein synthesis and autophagy. Targeting both of these
pathways may be an effective means to regulate cell growth. Signaling molecules promoting phosphorylation events are indicated in green.

with advanced HCC indicated that sirolimus (rapamycin)
was a promising drug for the treatment of HCC, and
currently, a phase I/II trial evaluating the rapamycin
analog RAD001 for advanced HCC is recruiting patients
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00390195).
A topic of considerable current interest concerns
the signal transduction pathways and the molecular
mechanisms linked to chemoresistance of tumor cells to
conventional anticancer drugs. In this context, combination
of rapamycin with the conventional cytostatic drugs
doxorubicin and vinblastine enhances the antineoplastic
activity of the respective monotherapeutic HCC treatment
with either doxorubicin or vinblastine alone [68, 69].
Taken together, the in vitro and preclinical in vivo data
as well as the clinical trials conducted so far demonstrate
that mTOR inhibitors are promising agents for HCC
treatment, particularly in combination with conventional
chemotherapeutic drug therapy.

to melanoma patients as monotherapy resulted in 1 partial
remission out of 33 patients [70]. Preclinical studies
performed in human melanoma cell lines have highlighted
that co-targeting of the Raf and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
pathways with Raf and Akt/mTOR inhibitors resulted
in synergistic inhibition [71]. Treatment of inducible
murine lung cancers containing KRAS and PIK3CA
mutations with PI3K/mTOR (NVP-BEZ235) and MEK
(selumetinib) inhibitors led to an enhanced response [72].
Recent reports have also indicated synergistic responses
between sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors in xenografts of a
highly metastatic human HCC tumor [73]. An illustration
documenting the rationale for the targeting of both
pathways is presented in Figure 3.
The combined effects of inhibiting MEK with PD0329501 and mTOR with rapamycin or its analog AP23573 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals/Merck) were examined
in human NSCLC cell lines, as well as in animal models
of human lung cancer [74]. PD-0325901 and rapamycin
demonstrated synergistic inhibition of proliferation
and protein translation. Suppression of both MEK and
mTOR inhibited ribosomal biogenesis and was associated
with a block in the initiation phase of translation. These
preclinical results support suppression of both the MEK
and mTOR pathways in lung cancer therapy and indicate
that both pathways converge to regulate the initiation of
protein translation. ERK phosphorylates MAPK signal
integrating kinases (Mnk1/2) and p90 ribosomal S6
kinase p90Rsk, which regulate the activity of the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor eIF4E. The phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 is altered in cells with the BRAF mutation. It
should also be pointed out that the 4EBP1 is also regulated
by Akt, mTOR and p70S6K. This may result in the
efficient translation of certain mRNAs in BRAF-mutant
cells. This could explain how co-inhibition of MEK and
mTOR synergize to inhibit protein translation and growth
in certain lung cancer cells.

Increasing the Effectiveness of
Targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways by
Simultaneous Treatment with
Two Pathway Inhibitors
The obvious goal of current inhibitor development is
to improve the effectiveness of treatment of cancer patients
with small molecule signal transduction inhibitors. This
has proven to be difficult for multiple reasons: first, as
previously discussed, there tends to be a distinct genetic
susceptibility for the success of a signal transduction
inhibitor in suppressing growth, second, many of the small
molecule signal transduction inhibitors are cytostatic as
opposed to being cytotoxic and therefore will need to be
combined with a therapeutic modality that induces cell
death and will be discussed below and third, more than
one signal transduction pathway may be activated in the
cancer cells, which will be discussed in detail below.
Previously, we have predominantly discussed studies
that employed a single Raf or MEK inhibitor, sometimes
in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug. In the
following section, we discuss the potential of combining
inhibitors that target two pathways to more effectively limit
cancer growth. In addition to the BRAF mutations present
in melanomas that we have previously discussed, the
PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor gene is also deleted
in approximately 45% of melanomas and the downstream
AKT gene is amplified in approximately 45%. Both of
these mutations result in increased expression/activity
of Akt which is often associated with a poor prognosis
in human cancer. Increased Akt expression will lead
to mTOR activation and increased efficiency of protein
translation. The targeting of mTOR has been examined in
melanoma therapy as well as in the treatment options for
many diverse cancers. Administration of mTOR inhibitors

Enhancing Effectiveness of Raf/
MEK and PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors
with Chemotherapy
Classical chemotherapy often remains the most
prescribed anti-cancer therapy for many different types
of cancer treatment [75]. Drugs such as doxorubicin
and taxol are effective in the treatment of many cancers,
even though in some cases drug resistance develops after
prolonged treatment. Doxorubicin and taxol target cellular
events, such as DNA replication and cell division, which
are often downstream of the targets of signal transduction
pathway inhibitors. Chemotherapeutic drugs can activate
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by diverse mechanisms
(See Figure 4). Drugs such as doxorubicin can activate
p53 which can lead to increased expression of the
discoidin domain receptor (DDR), which in turn can result
in Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. Activated ERK can

Figure 4: Targeting Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways May Prevent Drug Resistance and
Reemergence of Cancer Initiating Cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Docetaxel may also induce the Raf/MEK/

ERK pathway which may contribute to emergence of drug resistant clones. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may regulate downstream transcription
factors such as GATA-1 which control the transcription of genes such as XRCC1 and ERCC1 which are involved in DNA repair and their
aberrant expression may contribute to drug resistance. Treatment of drug resistant cells with MEK inhibitors, or combined treatments consisting
of a chemotherapeutic drug and a MEK inhibitor, may be an effective approach to prevent drug resistance. Treatment of certain cancer
initiating cells with Akt or mTOR inhibitors may prevent their reemergence. Various components of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway
are implicated in drug resistance. Changes in Akt expression may occur to mutations at PI3K or PTEN. Furthermore, altered expression of
microRNAs may be involved in decreasing PTEN expression which results in drug resistance. The roles of these various genetic changes in
cancer initiating cells are beginning to become apparent. Chemotherapeutic drugs are indicated in irregular black elipses. Treatment of certain

phosphorylate p53 and regulate its activity. Doxorubicin
can also activate the calcium calmodulin dependent kinase
(CaM-K) cascade via reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4].
Activation of this cascade can also result in activation of
the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Activation of this cascade
can result in the transcription of genes such as XRCC1 and
ERCC1 which are involved in DNA repair and lead to drug
resistance [75, 76]. Taxols can also stimulate activation
of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and lead to their increased
association with proteins involved in cell division [77,
78]. Thus, by combining classical chemotherapy with
targeted therapy, it may be possible to enhance toxicity,
while lowering the prescribed concentrations of classical
chemotherapeutics necessary for effective elimination
of the tumor [78]. As we have previously discussed,
activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade can alter the
activity and subcellular localization of many proteins that
play critical roles in apoptotic cascades. Also the Raf/
MEK/ERK cascade can regulate the transcription of many
critical genes involved in cell cycle progression, growth
and differentiation.
A phase II trial demonstrated that the combination
of sorafenib and doxorubicin improves progression-free
and overall survival of patients with advanced HCC [79].
Moreover, a phase II trial is currently recruiting patients to
determine the progression-free survival of sorafenib plus
tegafur/uracil (UFUR) for the treatment of advanced or
metastatic HCC.
As mentioned previously, a side effect of some
chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, is the
induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. Activation of
this pathway can under certain circumstances promote
proliferation and prevent apoptosis. Also the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathway can modulate the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway and altering MEK activity can have opposing
effects on different cell types [80, 81]. Combining
paclitaxel treatment with PI3K inhibitors enhances
apoptosis and inhibits growth of ovarian carcinoma
cell lines, and this may have been mediated in part by
suppression of inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf by Akt
[80]. In addition, the effects of combined treatment with
MEK inhibitors and paclitaxel have been examined. The
synergistic effects of paclitaxel and MEK inhibitors are
complex and have not been fully elucidated, but may be
in part mediated by inhibition of Bad phosphorylation at
S112 by ERK in UM-SCC-23 squamous carcinoma cell
line [82]. This is just one documented interaction that may
be suppressed by MEK inhibitors. Obviously many other
key phosphorylation events mediated by ERK may be
suppressed which play critical roles in cell growth.
The cytotoxic effects of combinations of MEK
inhibitors and paclitaxel may be specific for cells of certain
origins and may depend on the levels of endogenous
activated MEK/ERK present in those cells. In a study with
NSCLC cells which constitutively-expressed activated
MEK/ERK, no increase in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was observed when the cells were treated with a MEK
inhibitor [81]. In contrast, addition of a dominant negative
(DN) MEK gene to these cells potentiated paclitaxelinduced apoptosis.
Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was associated with
increased levels of both p53 and the downstream Bax
protein in a study with neuroblastoma cells [82]. Activated
ERK1/ERK2 levels also increased in these cells upon
cisplatin treatment. MEK inhibitors blocked apoptotic cell
death, which prevented the cisplatin-induced accumulation
of p53 and Bax proteins [82].
It should be noted that the combination of MEK
inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs may not always
result in a positive interaction. In some cases, combination
therapy results in an antagonistic response. For example,
combining MEK inhibitors with betulinic acid, a drug
toxic for melanoma cells, antagonized the normal
enhancing effects of betulinic acid on apoptosis in vitro
[83]. Furthermore, the precise timing of the addition of two
agents is important as they may differentially affect cellcycle progression; therefore, the order of administration
may be important for a synergistic response to be obtained
and perhaps to prevent an antagonistic response [83].

Enhancing Effectiveness of Raf/
MEK and PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors
with Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is a common therapeutic approach
for treatment of many diverse cancers. A side effect
of radiotherapy in some cells is induction of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade [4]. Recently various
signal transduction inhibitors have been evaluated as
radiosensitizers. The effects of pre-treatment of lung,
prostate, and pancreatic cancer cells with selumetinib
were evaluated in vitro using human cell lines and in vivo
employing xenografts [84]. The MEK inhibitor treatment
radiosensitized the various cancer cell lines in vitro and
in vivo. The MEK inhibitor treatment was correlated with
decreased Chk1 phosphorylation 1-2 hrs after radiation.
The authors noticed the effects of the MEK inhibitor on
the G2 checkpoint activation after irradiation, as the MEK
inhibitor suppressed G2 checkpoint activation. Since
ERK1/ERK2 activity is necessary for carcinoma cells to
arrest at the G2 checkpoint, suppression of phosphorylated
Chk1 was speculated to lead to the abrogated G2
checkpoint, increased mitotic catastrophe and impaired
activation of cell cycle checkpoints. Mitotic catastrophe
was increased in cells receiving both the MEK inhibitor
and radiation when compared to the solo-treated cells. It
was also postulated in this study that the MEK inhibitor
suppressed the autocrine cascade in DU145 prostate
cancer cells that normally resulted from EGF secretion and
EGFR activation. Suppression of this autocrine cascade
by the MEK inhibitor may have served as a radiosensitizer
to the radiation therapy. The other two cancer cell lines

Identification of Novel Sites In
the PIK3CA Gene Which Confer
Resistance to PI3K Inhibitors

examined in this study (A549 and MiaPaCa2) had KRAS
mutations and both were radiosensitized by the MEK
inhibitor. Although these studies document the ability of a
MEK inhibitor to radiosensitize certain cells, clearly other
cancer cell lines without activating mutations in the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway or autocrine growth stimulation
should be examined for radiosensitization by the MEK
inhibitor as the KRAS mutation may also activate the PI3K
pathway which could lead to therapy resistance.
PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors will sensitize the tumor
vasculature to radiation both in vitro in cell lines and in
vivo in xenogratfs [85, 86]. mTOR and radiation play
critical roles in the regulation of autophagy [87, 88].
When mTOR is blocked by rapamycin there is an increase
in autophagy. This is important as apoptotic cell death is
a minor component to cell death in solid tumors. These
studies document the potential beneficial use of combining
mTOR inhibitors and radiation to improve the induction
of autophagy in the treatment of solid tumors.
Just as new inhibitors are described, cells and tumors
resistant to these inhibitors will also be discovered.
Resistance to Gleevec (Imatinib) a BCR-ABL inhibitor
has been well documented and novel inhibitors have been
discovered to overcome this resistance [89]. Recently two
distinct mechanisms for resistance to Raf inhibitors have
been described [90, 91]. In one case, the BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells that had been maintained in medium
containing the B-Raf inhibitor AZ628 shifted their
dependence from B-Raf to Raf-1 [91]. In another case,
some B-Raf mutant melanoma cells may be intrinsically
resistant to B-Raf inhibitors as a result of cyclin D
amplification [91]. Some of these “additional” genetic
mutations may be preexisting in the tumor cell population
and upon culture of the cells or tumor in the presence of
the Raf inhibitor; the “mutant-resistant” cells may take
over the population.

A group of highly-gifted graduate students and their
colleagues developed an innovative approach to identify
residues in PIK3CA that will result in resistance or
increased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors [94]. Frequently
mutations in kinases which confer resistance to inhibitors
occur in the gatekeeper residues that block drug binding. In
an insightful study performed by Zunder and colleagues,
they took advantage of the fact that yeast do not contain or
express PIK3CA and that the product of PIK3CA (PI3K)
is normally toxic to yeast [94]. Therefore introduction of
membrane-localized PIK3CA into yeast resulted in yeast
toxicity, however, when they treated the transfected yeast
with a PI3K inhibitor, the yeast survived. They found that
certain mutations in PIK3CA would confer resistance to
the PI3K inhibitors, preventing growth, in transfected
yeast at drug concentrations which would allow normal
membrane-localized PIK3CA-transfected yeast to grow.
Unlike with BCR-ABL inhibitor resistant mutations, these
PIK3CA mutations did not reside in the classic gatekeeper
residues. As a biological bonus, they also identified some
mutations in PIK3CA (L814C) that conferred enhanced
sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors. These mutations allowed
the growth of the mutant PIK3CA-transfected yeast at
inhibitor concentrations that would normally suppress
the growth of yeast bearing the WT membrane-localized
PIK3CA. Furthermore, such information is valuable for
the design of novel PI3K inhibitors that will be effective
in the treatment of cancer patients which become resistant
to the first generation of PI3K inhibitors.

In Table 1, a detailed summary of many of the
various Raf, MEK, PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors which
have been evaluated in preclinical and cancer clinical
trials is presented [89, 95-178]. Clearly targeting these
activities involved in normal and cancerous growth has
become an intensely investigate field. Perhaps some of
the most recent success has arisen in targeting mTOR.
The regulation of mTOR and its subsequent effects on
protein translation is critically implicated in many cancers
[171-181] and is also involved in cell differentiation [182185], cancer initiating cells [187-198] and other important
cellular processes as will be discussed below.

Cancers containing PIK3CA mutations are often
sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the
modified rapamycins (Rapalogs). However, PIK3CAmutant cells that also have mutations at KRAS are
resistant to Rapalogs [92, 93]. This maybe due to
complicated feedback loops between the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways wherein
either mTORC1 inhibition leads to ERK1/2 activation by
a p70S6K/PI3K/Ras dependent pathway or by the KRAS
mutants activating p90Rsk-1 which serves to activate eIF4B
and rpS6 thereby bypassing mTOR-dependent activation.

Novel Uses of Raf/MEK and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR Inhibitors: Targeting
Cancer Initiating Cells (CICs)

to more effectively target these biochemical events from
happening and inhibit tumor progression.

Targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways to
Suppress Cellular Senescence/
Quiesence

An overview of the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathways in some of novel aspects of their
usage is presented in Figure 4. Targeting these pathways
may be an approach to overcome chemotherapeutic
drug resistance. An area of intense research interest in
experimental therapeutics is the cancer stem cell, more
appropriately referred to as the cancer initiating cell
(CIC) [89, 187-243]. CICs often share some properties
with drug resistant cells as they both are often resistant
to chemotherapeutic and hormonal based therapies. The
abilities of the various Raf, MEK and mTOR inhibitors
as well as the natural product resveratrol to target and
suppress the proliferation of CICs are beginning to be
examined [185, 191-195, 212-220]. It is not clear whether
Raf or MEK inhibitors will specifically target CICs [193,
194]. CICs have unique properties from the majority of
the particular cancer (often called bulk cancer) as they can
be both quiescent and also resistant to chemotherapeutic
and hormonal based drugs, often due to their increased
expression of proteins involved in drug transport as well
as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway [89, 193, 194, 197200, 224-226]. However, under certain conditions, they
resume proliferation and hence should be potentially
susceptible to: Raf, MEK, PI3K, Akt, mTOR and other
inhibitors Targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
mTOR pathways could be very important in terms of CIC
elimination.
The “tumor microenvironment” most likely plays
critical roles in CIC survival and also reemergence
and subsequent metastasis [206-211]. Combinations
of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs and inhibitors
which target the Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/mTOR
and upstream kinases may be an eventual approach to
target the tumor microenviroment, however, specificity
of targeting may be a significant problem. The ability to
target the tumor microenvironment is a challenging issue.
Recently miRNAs have been shown to regulate
many genes involved in drug resistance and likely CIC
regulation [200, 223]. miRNAs specific of the 3’UTR
of PTEN have been shown to be upregulated in certain
ovarian cancer cells and can cause resistance to cisplatin
[223]. One can also hypothesize that there may be altered
expression of similar or additional miRNAs in CICs which
will alter their sensitivities to mTOR and other inhibitors.
The p53 pathway and genome stability/instability play
key roles in regulating many aspects of cell growth
including CICs [225-243]. We know very little about the
changes in p53 and genome stability/instability that may
occur in the initial CIC to more “malignant” CICs which
may be present at later stages of tumor progression. As
we learn more regard the effects of p53 and DNA damage
responses on CIC and they development, we may be able
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
pathways also play critical roles in the regulation of
cellular senescence and quiescence [227-242]. Escape
from drug-induced senescence has also been associated
with drug resistance and CICs [227]. Often an additional
key molecule implicated in: DNA damage responses,
cellular senescence and drug resistance is p53, whose
activity can be regulated by both the Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways. These pathways exert
their effects on p53 itself (post-translation modification by
ERK and many other kinases as well as on the p53 inhibitor
MDM-2 [231-236, 239-242]. mTOR can modulate the
ability of p53 to promote senescence or quiescence [239,
240]. Genomic instability and epigenomic regulation
can also have key effects on CIC generation and cellular
senescence/quiescence [233-240] and can be regulated in
part by mTOR [239-242].

Targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
Pathways
to
Suppress
Cellular
and
Organismal Aging
While we have discussed the roles of these pathways
in cancer in significant detail, an additional important
aspect of targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathways is to halt cellular aging, which in
the end, kills all those who either do not have or have
been fortunate to survive cancer and other diseases. There
is an emerging scientific field which documents that
slowing the growth process and stimulating metabolism
will slow aging and perhaps dementia as well [243-273].
Indeed, caloric restriction may be critically important in
suppression of aging as well as cancer [263-273]. Many
studies have indicated that inhibiting the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways will influence
aging [251, 254, 255, 256]. These experiments have led
to innovative hypothesis that cellular senescence results
from the hyper-activation of proliferative pathways and
that drugs (e.g., Metformin) and signal transduction
inhibitors (e.g., Raf, MEK, PI3K, mTOR inhibitors) can
inhibit cellular proliferation and cellular aging [251, 254,
255, 256, 271]. Similar effects on the prevention of cellular
senescence were observed with Resveratrol, the active
component contained in the skins of red grapes which
was shown to also inhibit mTOR and p70S6K cellular
senescence [193, 194, 252, 256, 257, 259]. Additional
151

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 135 - 164

studies have shown that the commonly-prescribed
diabetes drug Metformin will also inhibit mTOR and
prevent cellular aging [246, 247, 266, 270, 271]. Since
both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathways interact to regulate the activity of mTOR
and downstream components of this pathway are critical
for both mRNA stability and protein translation of genes
involved in critical growth and survival, it is believed
that by inhibiting some of these key pathways, it may be
possible to prevent cellular aging.

the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, then it may be sensitive
to Raf and MEK inhibitors. In contrast, tumors that do
not display enhanced expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway may not be sensitive to either Raf or MEK
inhibitors but if the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is
activated, it may be sensitive to specific inhibitors that
target this pathway. Some promising recent observations
indicate that certain CICs are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors,
documenting their potential use in the elimination of the
cells responsible for cancer re-emergence [185, 191].
Some CICs may be sensitive to Resveratrol. Finally, it is
likely that many of the inhibitors that we have discussed
in this review will be more effective in inhibiting tumor
growth in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
drugs or radiation.
Some scientists and clinicians have considered that
the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual
inhibitors may be more effective in cancer therapy than
just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves. This is based
in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops
from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK. For example
when MEK1 is targeted, ERK1,2 is inhibited and the
negative feed-back loop on MEK is broken and activated
MEK accumulates. However, if Raf is also inhibited, it
may be possible to completely shut down the pathway.
This is a rationale for treatment with both MEK and Raf
inhibitors. Likewise targeting both PI3K and mTOR may
be more effective than targeting either PI3K or mTOR
by themselves. If it is a single inhibitor which targets
both molecules, such as the new PI3K and mTOR dual
inhibitors this becomes a realistic therapeutic option.
Finally, an emerging concept is the dual targeting of two
different signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK
and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example. This has been
explored in some preclinical models as discussed in the
text. The rationale for the targeting of both pathways may
be dependent on the presence of mutations in either/or
both pathways or in upstream Ras in the particular cancer
which can activate both pathways. However, it is not clear,
at this point in time, that the targeting of two different
kinases in the same pathway or two different kinases in
two different pathways with two different inhibitors will
be performed clinically in the near future. While it may be
scientifically interesting and effective it may be clinically
impractical. It might make more clinical sense to target
one kinase and also use a chemotherapeutic drug which
will kill the cells.
It is not always clear why a particular combination of
a signal transduction inhibitor and chemotherapeutic drug
works in one tumor type but not at all in a different tumor
type. This has also been experience with the development
of individual chemotherapeutic drugs, some work in some
cells but not others. This may result from many different
complex interacting events. Some of these events could
include: percentage of cells in different phases of the cell
cycle, persistence of CICs and many other factors. Finally,

Conclusions
Various pharmaceutical companies have developed
inhibitors to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Initially
MEK inhibitors were shown to have the most specificity.
However, these inhibitors may have limited effectiveness
in treating human cancers, unless the particular cancer
proliferates directly in response to the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway. Moreover, MEK inhibitors are often cytostatic
as opposed to cytotoxic, thus their ability to function as
effective anti-cancer agents in a monotherapeutic setting
is limited, and they may be more effective when combined
with chemo or radiotherapy. Raf inhibitors have also been
developed and some are being used to treat various cancer
patients (e.g., Sorafenib). This particular Raf inhibitor also
inhibits other receptors and kinases which may be required
for the growth of the particular cancer. This promiscuous
nature of Sorafenib has contributed to the effectiveness
of this particular Raf inhibitor for certain cancers. Mutant
specific Raf and PI3K inhibitors are also being developed.
This is perhaps the most exciting area in terms of inhibitor
development as it may result in the effective targeting
of the mutant gene promoting the proliferation of the
particular tumor. However, problems have been identified
with certain B-Raf mutant allele inhibitors as they will also
result in Raf-1 activation if Ras is mutated. Combination
therapy with either a traditional drug/physical treatment
or another inhibitor that targets a specific molecule in
a different signal transduction pathway is also a key
approach for improving the effectiveness and usefulness
of MEK and Raf inhibitors.
Modified rapamycins, Rapalogs are being used to
treat various cancer patients, (e.g., patients with RCC and
HCC). While Rapalogs are effective and their toxicity
profiles are well know, one inherent property is that they
are not very cytotoxic when it comes to killing tumor cells.
This inherent property of rapamycins, may also contribute
to their low toxicity in humans.
Mutations at many of the upstream receptor genes
or Ras can result in abnormal Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Hence targeting
these cascade components with small-molecule inhibitors
may inhibit cell growth.. The usefulness of these inhibitors
may depend on the mechanism of transformation of the
particular cancer. If the tumor exhibits a dependency on

chemotherapeutic drug therapy and other types of therapy
(radiotherapy, antibody therapy) may induce certain
signalling pathways (e.g., the reactive oxygen species
generated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy induce the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway). The induction of these
signalling pathways may counteract some of the effects of
the signal transduction inhibitors.
Scientists and clinicians often have an intentionally
narrow view of a particular topic. For example, cancer
researchers predominantly feel that Raf, MEK, PI3K, Akt
and mTOR inhibitors will suppress the growth of malignant
cancer cells. Yet MEK and mTOR and other inhibitors may
also be useful in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic
disorder where there is abnormal cellular proliferation.
Recently it has been observed that the suppression of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways
may prevent the induction of cellular senescence and
aging. Clearly, these later two clinical topics, immune
disorders and aging, greatly enhance the potential clinical
uses of these targeted therapeutic drugs.
