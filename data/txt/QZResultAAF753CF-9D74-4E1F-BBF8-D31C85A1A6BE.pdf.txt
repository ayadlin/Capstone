Abstract
Maintenance chemotherapy is an important part of the treatment of ALL in
children. It relies on the long-term oral administration of daily low-dose mercaptopurin
and weekly low-dose methotrexate. Although it has been used in the clinic for
decades, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we investigated different
angiogenic and immune biomarkers to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of
maintenance therapy in children with ALL. We thus monitored circulating endothelial
cells (CEC), endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and endothelial microparticles
(EMP), pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, VEGFR-1 and Ang-2), anti-angiogenic factor
thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) in 47 children with
ALL during the maintenance phase of their treatment (at treatment initiation and after
6, 12 and 18 months). We observed a statistically significant decrease in EPC and EMP
counts throughout the maintenance phase associated with a significant increase in
THBS1 levels. No significant change was detected in other angiogenic markers or in
Treg numbers.
The results presented here indicate that maintenance therapy in children with ALL
exerts its antitumor activity at least in part through anti-angiogenic effects, similar
to those induced by metronomic chemotherapy. Larger studies are now warranted to
validate these findings and determine their clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION

significantly below the single maximal tolerated dose and
with no prolonged drug-free breaks [3, 4], has recently
emerged as an alternative strategy to conventional highdose chemotherapy. Despite accumulating clinical
evidence in a variety of human cancers [4], the efficacy
of MC is yet to be validated in large randomized phase III
trials. However, as originally theorized by Barton Kamen,
maintenance therapy in leukemia can be considered, in
retrospect, as the early prototype of successful MC [5].
Angiogenesis plays a role in the pathogenesis and
progression of hematological malignancies [6] including

Maintenance chemotherapy is an important part
of the treatment of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in
children to prevent relapse by eliminating minimal residual
disease [1, 2]. The cornerstone of ALL maintenance
therapy relies on the oral administration of daily low-dose
mercaptopurin and weekly low-dose methotrexate for a
period of time ranging from 2 to 3 years [1]. Interestingly,

RESULTS

leukemia and MC has initially been demonstrated to be
an antiangiogenic therapy [3]. Tumor angiogenesis can
be easily and non-invasively monitored by analysis of
circulating endothelial cells (CEC), endothelial progenitor
cells (EPC) and endothelial microparticles (EMP), which
are established biomarkers of endothelial integrity in
peripheral blood. However, new mechanisms of action
of MC have been unveiled, such as i) stimulation of
anticancer immune response by depletion of regulatory
T lymphocytes (Treg) or activation of dendritic cells, ii)
re-induction of tumor dormancy, and iii) potential direct
effects against cancer stem cells [4]. Thus, maintenance
therapy in leukemia, whose mechanisms of action remain
unclear [1, 2], could exert metronomic-like effects and
represent a form of multi-targeted therapy.
The aim of this study was to monitor the impact
of a maintenance treatment on endothelial biomarkers,
angiogenic cytokines, and Treg in 47 children with ALL.

In the 47 children enrolled in this study, endothelial
biomarkers analysis indicated no statistically significant
change in CEC and platelet counts during maintenance
therapy (Figure 1). In contrast, EMP counts decreased at
E12 and E18 with a significant change after 18 months of
maintenance therapy compared to baseline counts (11.3
+/- 12.84 EMP/µL vs 5.47 +/- 1.39 ; p < 0.05) (Figure
2A). In line with EMP levels, EPC counts decreased
throughout the maintenance phase with values dropping
from 507 +/- 272 EPC/mL at E0 to 112.9 +/- 126.6 (p <
0.001), 91.06 +/- 83.97 (p < 0.05) and 92.32 +/- 181.1
(p < 0.01) at E6, E12 and E18, respectively (Figure
2B). Moreover, all of EMP values measured during
maintenance treatment correlated with those of EPC (p <
0.05) (Figure 1C). Interestingly, THBS-1, which is a wellestablished mediator of the antiangiogenic activity of MC

DISCUSSION

[7], increased at E12 and E18 with a significant change at
E18 compared to baseline (6341 +/- 4121 ng/mL vs 9319
+/- 4095; p < 0.01) (Figure 2C). In sharp contrast, analysis
of other angiogenic cytokines indicated no statistically
significant change in VEGF, VEGF-R1 and ANG-2 levels
throughout the maintenance phase (Figure 3). There were
no significant correlations between biomarkers.
Only one patient (n°14-Table 1) relapsed during the
maintenance phase. Noteworthily, this patient displayed
high levels of EPC (3092/ml) shortly before relapsing.
The role of the immune system is gaining a
considerable interest in solid tumors [8] and is a wellestablished actor of leukemia treatment. More specifically,
Tregs are being increasingly documented as key players in
the antitumor activity of MC [4]. However, in this study,
Treg counts did not significantly vary during maintenance
therapy (Figure 3D).

How maintenance therapy operates in children
with ALL remains highly speculative [1, 2]. Several
mechanisms of action have been proposed. They include
direct long-term cytotoxicity on leukemia cells and
inhibition of leukemia stem cell maintenance. The results
of the present study provide interesting new insights into
how maintenance therapy might affect residual leukemia
disease.
In cardiovascular pathologies, the significance of
endothelial biomarkers has been clearly established [9].
Indeed, elevated counts of CEC and EMP in the peripheral
blood can be considered as markers of endothelial injury
and vascular dysfunction, while decrease in EPC, which
contribute to endothelium repair processes, plays a critical
role in progression of cardiovascular diseases [10]. In
clinical oncology, interpretation of these biomarkers
levels and kinetics is more complex [11]. CEC and
EPC can be considered as surrogate biomarkers of

angiogenesis and used for instance to monitor the activity
of antiangiogenic agents [12]. The results presented here
indicate a significant impact of maintenance therapy on
endothelium integrity. The significant decrease in EMP
counts and circulating EPC levels underlined a reduction
in endothelium activation. Taken together, decreases in
these cellular biomarkers and increase in THBS-1 levels,
suggest that maintenance therapy reduces endothelium
turn-over and restores its resting state. The mechanisms
by which maintenance therapy exerts this anti-endothelial
effect remains uncertain but several can be proposed.
A direct effect on endothelial cells has been previously
demonstrated for the 3 anticancer drugs involved here
[3, 13,15]. In addition, this effect could also be mediated
by VEGF inhibition and/or THBS-1 up-regulation [3,
7]. In the patients included in this study, VEGF levels
remained low and unchanged throughout maintenance
therapy; it is thus unlikely that VEGF plays a key role in
this setting. In contrast, we observed a significant increase
in the level of THBS-1, an antiangiogenic factor and
established mediator of MC efficacy [3, 4, 7]. Platelets
contain significant amount of bioactive factors such as
THBS-1 that can be released during platelet activation
and influence neovascularization [14]. It is important
to note however that the increase in THBS-1 levels

was not associated with significant changes in platelet
counts, suggesting that platelets may not be involved in
this context. However our study failed to demonstrate a
significant inverse correlation between EPCs or EMPs and
THBS-1 levels suggesting that THBS-1 may act in concert
with other potential mechanisms.
Tregs have recently gained considerable interest
from oncologists, as they have been associated with
decreased efficacy of treatment in pre-clinical and clinical
studies investigating MC [4, 15]. However, no change in
Treg numbers was observed as a result of maintenance
therapy in our study, suggesting that Tregs are not
implicated in the long-term control of ALL. Consistently,
Brtnický and al. [16] reported no significant change
in Treg numbers in patients with ovarian carcinoma
receiving maintenance MC with cyclophosphamide or
etoposide. Other immune cell types, such as dendritic cells
or myeloid-derived suppressors cells may be affected by
maintenance therapy [4, 15]. For instance, Hasnis and
al. [17] reported that metronomic gemcitabine improved
pancreatic adenocarcinoma outcome by inhibiting the
pro-tumorigenic effects induced by myeloid-derived
suppressor cells. Future studies are required to characterize
the evolution of these cell types during ALL maintenance
therapy.

PATIENTS and METHODS

The results presented here indicate that maintenance
treatment in children with ALL not only pharmacologically
but also mechanistically represents a form of metronomic
treatment, acting at least in part by decreasing endothelium
activity. Larger studies are mandatory to confirm these
effects and evaluate their clinical implications. These
studies may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers
and pave the way to strengthen the antiangiogenic effect
of maintenance therapy.

of PE–KDR antibody (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).
10µl of concentration-matched PE-conjugated murine
IgG1 antibody was used as fluorescence minus one (FMO)
control. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature,
cells were washed, resuspended in 500 μL of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies), and analyzed
with a FC 500 Cytometer. After selection of 7-AADnegative cells, KDR+ cells were identified within CD34+
cells displaying FSC/SSC characteristics corresponding to
the lymphocyte cluster. At least 5 × 105 viable cells were
acquired per run. The percentage of KDR+ cells among
CD34+ cells was determined, and absolute values were
calculated by multiplying the percentage of KDR+ cells
by the absolute values of CD34+ cells. Absolute values
of circulating CD34+ cells were determined in whole
blood using the single plateform sequential gating strategy
according to the standardized ISHAGE protocol [20].

Enumeration of circulating endothelial cells
(CEC)
As previously described [18], CECs were isolated
by immuno-magnetic separation using CD146-coated
Dynabeads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California,
USA) from 1mL of whole blood samples collected into
EDTA. Isolated cells were then incubated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) - coupled Ulex europeaus lectin-1
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and quantified with
fluorescence microscopy at 533nm. CECs were identified
according to the following consensus morphologic and
immunologic criteria: rosetted cells with sizes over 15µm
in diameter, bearing more than 5 beads and binding Ulex
europeaus lectin-1. The number of CECs was expressed as
cells per mL of blood.

Enumeration of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs)
CD4+ CD25+ Tregs were quantified with a flow
cytometry method from whole blood samples collected
into EDTA [21]. One hundred µl of samples were
labeled 20min at room temperature with 10 µl PE-CD25,
Phycoerythrin-Texas Red (ECD)-CD4, and PhycoerythrinCyanin5 (PC5)-CD3 antibodies (Beckman Coulter). After
lysis of Erythrocytes, cells were washed, resuspended in
500µl of PBS, and analyzed with a FC500 Cytometer.
The proportion of CD4+ CD25+ Tregs among CD3+
lymphocytes was determined. Absolute values of Tregs
in element mm-3 were calculated using the proportion
of CD3+ cells obtained by flow cytometry and the
lymphocytes numeration obtained from Hemocytometer
Instrument.

microparticles

CD31+ CD41- EMPs were quantified in plateletpoor citrated plasma (PPP). Briefly, PPP was prepared
using serial centrifugations (15 min at 1500 × g, 2 min at
13 000 × g) and stored at − 80 °C until use. Thirty µL of
thawed PPP were labeled 30min at room temperature with
10µl of CD41-FITC (Biocytex, Marseille, France), and
10µl of CD31-PE (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).
20µl of concentration-matched PE-conjugated murine
IgG1 antibody was used as CD31 fluorescence minus one
(FMO) control. After incubation, samples were diluted in
500µl of PBS (Life Technologies) and 30µl of flowcount
beads (Beckman Coulter) were added for calculation of
microparticles absolute values. CD31+ CD41- EMPs were
quantified with a FC500 Cytometer (Beckman Coulter)
with a previously described standardized flow cytometry
protocol for microparticles counting [19]. Results were
expressed as EMP per µl of PPP.

Analysis of angiogenic cytokines
Circulating levels of VEGF, VEGF-R1,
Thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1), and angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) were measured in serum using commercially available
ELISA kits from R&D System Inc. (Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Assays were performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Enumeration of endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs)

Statistical analyses

Enumeration of CD34+KDR+ EPCs was
performed with three-color flow cytometry after direct
immunolabeling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) As previously described [10], PBMCs were
isolated from 5 mL of heparinized peripheral blood
by density gradient centrifugation with lymphocyte
separation medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria),
and labeled with 10 μL of 7-AAD Viability Dye, 10 μL
of FITC–CD34 antibody (Beckman Coulter), and 10 μL

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism Software v.4.0. (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA, USA). Wilcoxon matched paired test was used
to compare different times of maintenance therapy.
Differences were considered significant when p was <
0.05. To determine the correlation between biomarkers,
Spearman correlation test was used with a confidence
interval of 95%.
