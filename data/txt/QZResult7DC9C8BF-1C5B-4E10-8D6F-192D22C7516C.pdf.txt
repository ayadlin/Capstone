Abstract
Gliomas are the most common adult primary brain tumors,
and the most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme, is
invariably fatal. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
signaling pathway is altered in most glioblastoma multiforme.
PTEN, an important negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt
pathway, is also commonly mutated in glioma, leading to
constitutive activation of Akt. One ultimate consequence is
phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO forkhead transcription factors that regulate genes involved in apoptosis,
cell cycle arrest, nutrient availability, DNA repair, stress, and
angiogenesis. We tested the ability of a mutant FOXO1 factor
that is not subject to Akt phosphorylation to overcome
dysregulated PI3K-Akt signaling in two PTEN-null glioma cell
lines, U87 and U251. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of
the mutant FOXO1 successfully restored cell cycle arrest and
induced cell death in vitro and prolonged survival in vivo in
xenograft models of human glioma (33% survival at 1 year
of animals bearing U251 tumors). However, U87 were much
more resistant than U251 to mutant FOXO1-induced death,
showing evidence of increased nuclear export and Aktindependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 at S249. A cyclindependent kinase 2 inhibitor decreased phosphorylation of
S249 and rendered U87 cells significantly more susceptible
to mutant FOXO1-induced death. Our results indicate that
targeting FOXO1, which is at the convergence point of several
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, can effectively induce glioma cell death and inhibit tumor growth. They
also highlight the importance of Akt-independent phosphorylation events in the nuclear export of FOXO1. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Considered one of the deadliest cancers, malignant gliomas are
the most common primary brain tumor found in adults (1). They
are highly aggressive, invasive, and neurologically destructive. The
median survival of patients diagnosed with the most malignant
manifestation of glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, ranges from 9 to
12 months, a statistic that has changed very little over the past two
decades despite recent advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and
chemotherapy (2, 3).
The increasing knowledge of genetic alterations that occur in
malignant gliomas has focused attention on development of targeted therapy to restore cell cycle or apoptosis defects in glioma

cells. The most common genetic changes described in glioblastoma
multiforme involve p53, ARF, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
and platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and EGF, members of the Rb pathway (Rb and p16), and
PTEN, which lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle and of apoptosis
(2). In view of this, as many oncogenes and tumor suppressors can
funnel through the same transcription factors, a general approach
may be to target these transcription factors. For example, the
effects of amplification of EGFR and loss of PTEN function can
potentially be reversed through the activity of a single downstream
transcription factor, such as FOXO1, to overcome defects in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway.
FOXO factors, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding
domain termed the ‘‘forkhead box’’ (4), include FOXO1, FOXO3,
FOXO4, and FOXO6 and were initially identified in humans, except
for FOXO6, at chromosomal translocations in tumors (5–9). All
FOXO factors use the same forkhead-responsive element and
transactivate many of the same genes in vitro (10), although recent
knockout mice of FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 indicate that they
are functionally diverse (11–13).
Nuclear localization of FOXO proteins is required for their
transcriptional regulatory functions, which include the control of
genes involved in apoptosis, such as Bim (14, 15) and FasL (16), and
genes involved in cell cycle regulation such as p27 (17, 18), cyclin
D1, and D2 (19, 20). As major direct substrates of Akt, FOXO factors
are negatively regulated by Akt phosphorylation in the presence of
growth factor signaling (21, 22), which results in their binding to
14-3-3 proteins, followed by their nuclear export (23). Once in the
cytoplasm, FOXO factors are ubiquitinated and are subjected to
degradation by the proteasome (21, 24).
PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway.
In cells that carry the PTEN mutation, the PI3K pathway is
constitutively active, leading to inactivation of endogenous FOXO
factors and possible initiation and progression of tumors (21).
Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that FOXO factors play
a significant role in cancer. Tumorigenicity in nude mice induced
by IKKh or the receptor tyrosine kinase, HER-2 oncogene, can be
overridden by an active form of FOXO3 or FOXO4, respectively (25).
Cytoplasmic expression of FOXO3 in breast cancer also correlates
highly with poor survival of patients (25).
In this study, we evaluated the potential of FOXO1 to correct the
consequences of frequent genetic mutations in EGFR and PTEN in
two representative cell lines of human glioblastoma multiforme,
U87 and U251. Both cell lines are PTEN null and EGFR expression
has been associated with increased tumorigenicity in both (26–28).
As malignant gliomas are characterized by intense microvascular
proliferation, with tumor capillaries that supply hundreds of tumor
cells, we hypothesized that FOXO1 would increase antitumor
effects by interfering with neovascularization (13). The FOXO1
protein we tested is mutated in three of its Akt phosphorylation
sites, T24, S256, and S319, which were converted into alanine
residues (FOXO1;AAA). Thus, FOXO1;AAA is not subject to Akt

phosphorylation control and should remain primarily nuclear
(29, 30). We found that the recombinant adenovirus AdFOXO1;AAA
could successfully restore cell cycle arrest and induce cell death
in vitro and prolong survival in vivo in xenograft models of human
glioma. However, U87 were much more resistant than U251 to
AdFOXO1;AAA-induced death. Our results indicate this may be
attributed to differences in cellular localization of FOXO1;AAA due
to phosphorylation at non-Akt sites possibly through the activity
of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK).

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
The human glioma cell lines U87 and U251 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection, whereas U343 and U373 were gifts of
Dr. R. DelMaestro (Montreal Neurological Institute). A subclone of the U251
cell line, U251N, which can produce intracerebral tumors in athymic nude
mice, was a gift from Dr. P.A. Forsyth. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.

CDK2 inhibitor treatment. Cells plated at a density of 5  103 in
96 wells were infected with adenovirus at a MOI of 50 and 24 h later treated
with 25 Amol/L CDK2 inhibitor II (CDK2iII; Calbiochem), dissolved in DMSO.
CDK2iII selectivity has been analyzed in previous studies [compound 3 in
Davis and colleagues (31) and compound 16 in Bramson and colleagues (32)],
which established an IC50 of 0.06 Amol/L for CDK2 and 0.750 Amol/L for
CDK1 (32). At the concentrations used here, the activities of both CDK1 and
CDK2 would be inhibited. After 24 h incubation with CDK2iII, cells
were examined by digital fluorescence microscopy (Leica) and all photographs were analyzed using ImageJ software. The number of cells exhibiting
nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic FOXO1;AAA localization was determined
by manual count of photos from sets of three independent infections.
Phosphorylation levels of FOXO1 protein were determined in AdFOXO1;AAA-infected cells, which had been treated with CDK2iII or vehicle
(DMSO). CDK2iII (25 Amol/L) was replenished at 24 h after infection and
cells were harvested for Western blot 48 h later. Blots were first incubated
with a rabbit antibody specific for phospho-FOXO1 at S249 (Cell Signaling).
The intensity of chemiluminescent bands captured by the CCD camera of
GeneGnome was quantitated by densitometry using GeneTools (Syngene).

Recombinant Adenovirus
AdFOXO1;AAA was described previously (19). In this adenovirus
construct, FOXO1;AAA is fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Viral particles were purified by CsCl gradients and quantified by
spectrophotometry at 260 and 280 nm. Infectious titers were estimated
by cytopathic effect on 293A cells.

In vitro Experimentation
Adenovirus infection. Adherent cells were washed with PBS, medium
was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated with
adenovirus for 3 h followed by culture in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum.
Control infections were carried out using either AdLacZ or AdGFP at the
same multiplicity of infection (MOI) as for AdFOXO1;AAA. To evaluate
transduction with AdFOXO1;AAA, GFP fluorescence was assessed by digital
fluorescence microscopy (Leica). Quantitation of transduction efficiency
was determined by flow cytometry of unfixed cells to detect GFP
fluorescence using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) in conjunction with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Cell cycle analysis. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry of
fixed unsynchronized propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells (Sigma). Flow
cytometric analysis was done on at least 10,000 cells for each sample and
cell cycle data were evaluated using ModFit LT software (Verity). The
percent of cells with sub-G1 peak was determined using CellQuest software.
The number of live and dead cells was assessed in a separate experiment by
flow cytometry of unfixed cells stained with PI to detect membrane
permeability to PI. All cell cycle and live/dead studies were done for at least
two independent adenovirus infections.
Annexin V-PE staining. Annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen) staining was
done as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions and PI was used to
distinguish between viable and nonviable cells. Samples were analyzed by
flow cytometry and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was
determined using WinMDI software.
Western blot. Samples (at a density of 1  105 cells) were cultured in
6-well plates for 1 day before transduction with AdFOXO1;AAA or AdLacZ
(at a MOI of 50) or mock infected (no virus). Cells were further cultured for
24, 48, or 72 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western
blotting. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-FOXO1 (Cell
Signaling), rabbit anti-p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti–cyclin
D1 (Neomarkers), rabbit anti–cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
anti-Bim (Affinity BioReagents), mouse anti–caspase-9 (Oncogene Research
Products), or mouse anti–h-actin (Abcam). The rabbit or mouse secondary
antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). Signal was
detected in the presence of SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Pierce)
and chemiluminescent images were captured by the CCD camera of
GeneGnome (Syngene).

sensitive to AdFOXO1;AAA.

The same blots were stripped and incubated with rabbit anti-FOXO1 (Cell
Signaling) and subjected to densitometry analysis to determine total FOXO1
expression. The level of phosphorylation was expressed as the ratio of
phospho-S249 FOXO1/total FOXO1. For comparison between cell lines, the
signal from U87 cells infected with AdFOXO1;AAA was assigned a value of 1.
Quantitation was done on at least two independent adenovirus infections/
inhibitor treatments.
To evaluate cell death following CDK inhibition, unpermeabilized cells
were stained with PI at various time points after AdFOXO1;AAA infection
and CDK2iII treatment. CDK2iII was replenished daily. Quantitation of PIpositive cells from three independent adenovirus infections/inhibitor
treatments was done using ImageJ software on digital photographs acquired
by fluorescence microscopy.

In vivo Experimentation
For intracerebral stereotactic injections into the caudate, U87LacZ and
U251N human glioma cells (1  105 in 3 AL HBSS) were implanted as outlined previously (33). Ten days later, mice were injected intratumorally with
AdFOXO1;AAA (1  1010 plaque-forming units/mL) or AdGFP (1  1010
plaque-forming units/mL) in a volume of 3 AL. During long-term survival
studies, animals were monitored daily. All experiments were carried out
according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care Committee.
Survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad
Prism software with the critical significance level (P) set to 0.05.

Results
Differential cytotoxic capacity in vivo. We tested the effect of
AdFOXO1;AAA in preimplanted intracerebral tumors of two
established and extensively used human glioma cell lines, U87
and U251. These tumors were allowed to grow for 10 days before
intratumoral injection of 3  109 particles of AdFOXO1;AAA or
AdGFP control vector. In short-term studies with the U87 cell line,
when tumor volumes were determined 35 days following intratumoral injection, the AdFOXO1;AAA tumors were significantly
smaller (Fig. 1B). However, in long-term survival studies, there was no
significant difference between mice implanted with U87 and treated
with AdFOXO1;AAA or AdGFP (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1).
In contrast, mice implanted with U251N and treated with
AdFOXO1;AAA had a significantly longer median survival than
AdGFP-treated and nontreated animals (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C). In fact,
when the experiment was stopped at the end of 1 year, 33% of the
tumor-bearing mice that had received AdFOXO1;AAA were still alive,
whereas all control animals had been euthanized by day 115 at the
latest (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S1). As both cell lines can be
transduced by Ad5 vectors to a similar degree (>90% transduction at
MOI of 50), these results indicate that they are differentially sensitive
to the effects of AdFOXO1;AAA.

Figure 3. Cell cycle analysis by flow
cytometry after infection with adenovirus. A,
to determine transducibility of U87 and U251
cells by AdFOXO1;AAA, cells were infected
at the indicated MOI and at various times
postinfection were analyzed by flow cytometry
for the expression of GFP (fused to
AdFOXO1;AAA). At MOI of z50, most
of the cells in both U87 and U251 populations
were GFP positive. B, cell cycle was
analyzed over a 72 h period; however, U251
cells infected with AdFOXO1;AAA at 48 h
and 72 h were mostly sub-G1 and are not
plotted. The percentage of cells in each phase
of the cell cycle was evaluated by ModFit
LT. Representative data for an experiment
repeated twice.

Evaluation of cytotoxic activity in vitro. To determine
whether response to AdFOXO1;AAA was also discordant in vitro,
we investigated the degree of cell death triggered by AdFOXO1;AAA
infection of U87 and U251 glioma cells. In adenovirus-transduced
cells, we examined by flow cytometry the sub-G1 peak (indicative of
DNA loss) following PI staining of fixed cells. There was a dosedependent increase in the sub-G1 peak for both U87 and U251 cells
infected with AdFOXO1;AAA over a period of 72 h; the higher
the MOI used, the more cell death was observed in both cell lines
(Fig. 2A). Of interest, AdFOXO1;AAA-induced death was much
more pronounced in U251 cells. Similar data were obtained with
flow cytometry of unfixed PI-stained cells, which provided a count

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

of live and dead cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). To confirm whether
cell death was attributable to apoptosis, flow cytometric analysis of
Annexin V-PE-stained cells was done at 48 h postinfection. Cells
infected with AdFOXO1;AAA had a much larger Annexin V-positive
population, indicating that these were actively undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the sub-G1 data, the apoptotic
proportion was greater in U251 cells than in U87 cells (59.0 F 11.5%
versus 13.1 F 0.7%; Fig. 2B). We tested the sensitivity of two
additional human glioma cell lines, U343 and U373. As seen Fig. 2C,
all glioma cell lines expressed equivalent levels of exogenous
FOXO1 when transduced with AdFOXO1;AAA at a MOI of 50.
However, U251 cells were the only ones particularly susceptible

to cell death as ascertained by quantitation of sub-G1 peak at
72 h postinfection (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that
AdFOXO1;AAA mediates a dose-dependent increase in cell death
through induction of apoptosis and that the cell death occurs in a
larger proportion of AdFOXO1;AAA-transduced U251 cells than
U87, U343, or U373 cells.
Cell cycle analysis. As FOXO1 can also regulate genes involved
in cell cycle arrest (19), we analyzed the cell cycle profile of glioma
cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 3). At 24 h, AdFOXO1;AAA-infected
U87 cells exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the S-phase
proportion (Fig. 3B ) and an increase in the G2-M phase.
Interestingly, the S-phase decrease was transient in the U87 cells,
with the S-phase proportion increasing at 72 h, whereas there was
a drop in the G1-phase proportion without a further increase in
the G2-M fraction (compared with 24 h). This suggests that the
AdFOXO1;AAA-infected U87 cells were once again proceeding
through the cell cycle. U251 cells exhibited a slightly different cell
cycle profile (Fig. 3B). At 24 h postinfection with AdFOXO1;AAA,
U251 cells had a higher proportion of cells in the G2-M phase
compared with uninfected control. U251 cells also showed a
decrease in the S-phase proportion compared with control, but
unlike the case with U87 cells, the proportion of cells in the S phase
did not increase with time. After 48 h, the majority of U251 cells
infected with AdFOXO1;AAA were sub-G1 (and were not plotted).
These data show that AdFOXO1;AAA induces cell cycle arrest in
both U87 and U251, but arrest is followed by extensive apoptotic
death only in U251 cells.
Expression of FOXO1 target genes in AdFOXO1;AAA-transduced glioma cells. To determine what mechanisms may be
contributing to AdFOXO1;AAA-induced apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest, immunoblot analysis of FOXO1 and its target gene products
was done. Infection with AdFOXO1;AAA at a MOI of 50 led to
expression of FOXO1 at f80 kDa in both U87 and U251 cells
24 h postinfection (Fig. 4A). There were undetectable levels of
endogenous FOXO1 expression in uninfected or AdLacZ-infected
U87 and U251 glioma cells. Noticeably, in U87 cells, there was a
decline in FOXO1 expression over 72 h, which may only be partly
related to increased cell death because only 30% undergo cell death
at this time point (Supplementary Fig. S1) and >80% of the
population is still transduced ( fluoresced green) at 72 h at a MOI
of 50 (Fig. 3A). In U251 cells, maximum expression was seen at 48 h,
and most cells were dead by 72 h, at which point FOXO1 protein

was no longer detected. These analyses revealed a marked difference in FOXO1 levels in the two cell lines following transduction
with AdFOXO1;AAA.
We further examined protein levels of selected FOXO target genes
implicated in cell cycle control, p27 and cyclins D1 and D2. The
CDK inhibitor p27 is transcriptionally regulated by FOXO factors
(17), causing both G1 and G2 arrest (34), whereas D-type cyclins
promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S and are down-regulated
by FOXO factors in a manner that does not require binding to DNA
(19). At 24 h postinfection in both U87 and U251 cells, p27 was
up-regulated in response to AdFOXO1;AAA, whereas cyclins D1
and D2 were down-regulated (Fig. 4B), a result consistent with the
literature (19). Interestingly, in U87 cells, there were changes in
expression profile during the course of the 72 h infection: cyclin D1
and D2 levels in response to AdFOXO1;AAA returned to control
levels, whereas the expression of p27 declined slightly. In contrast,
neither p27 nor cyclins D1 and D2 in U251 cells changed from 24 to
48 h. Therefore, the cell cycle arrest seen at 24 h postinfection with
AdFOXO1;AAA may be mediated by a down-regulation of D-type
cyclins and an increase in p27. Importantly, the transient arrest in
U87 cells may be the result of declining FOXO1;AAA expression
along with a return of D-type cyclins and a fall in p27 levels.
FOXO1 also transcriptionally up-regulates the proapoptotic protein Bim (14, 15), a member of the Bcl-2 family, as well as caspase-9,
an initiator caspase of the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway, which must be cleaved for activation. In U87 cells at 48 h,
Bim was modestly up-regulated, but not cleaved caspase-9, although
pro-caspase-9 was increased (Fig. 4B). At 72 h, pro-caspase-9 and
Bim levels fell, consistent with our previous observations that
FOXO1;AAA expression is transient in U87 cells. In contrast, in U251
cells, the expression of Bim and cleaved caspase-9 increased,
suggesting that susceptibility to apoptotic death may be attributed
to Bim activation and consequent death mediated via caspase-9.
Cellular localization of FOXO1;AAA and modulation of
FOXO1;AAA activity by phosphorylation at S249. Because
nuclear localization of FOXO proteins is required for their
transcriptional regulatory functions, a comparison of the subcellular localization of FOXO1;AAA ( fused to GFP) was done to
ascertain whether this may partially explain the varying sensitivity
of glioma cells to AdFOXO1;AAA-induced apoptosis. At 24 and
48 h after infection, FOXO1;AAA expression in U251 cells remained
primarily nuclear (Fig. 5A); in contrast, at 48 h in U87 cells,

FOXO1;AAA was almost evenly distributed between the cytoplasm
and the nucleus (Fig. 5A). Thus, in U87 cells, FOXO1;AAA may be
regulated in an Akt phosphorylation-independent manner, leading
to its nuclear export and attenuation of transcriptional activity.
This greater propensity for cytoplasmic localization in U87 cells
may offer an explanation for the transient nature of the expression
profile of FOXO1 target genes and the lower percentage of cell
death in U87 cells compared with U251 cells.
Recent reports indicate that CDK1 and CDK2 may influence
the nuclear export of FOXO1 through phosphorylation of S249,
a residue that is unmodified in FOXO1;AAA. In U87 cells, a
24 h treatment with the CDK2 inhibitor (CDK2iII) altered the
subcellular localization of FOXO1;AAA, with a greater proportion of
transduced cells manifesting a nuclear signal for the fusion protein
than in DMSO-treated control cells (Fig. 5B and C). In support
of these observations, 48 h after AdFOXO1;AAA transduction, U87
cells manifested higher levels of phospho-S249 compared with
U251 cells (Fig. 6A and B). Treatment with CDK2iII greatly

diminished the ratio of phospho-S249 to total FOXO in both cell
lines (Fig. 6A and B). Next, we tested whether CDK inhibition
would potentiate AdFOXO1;AAA-mediated cell death in the U87
cell line (Fig. 6C). As expected, incubation of cells with CDK2iII
alone led to a low level of cell killing (f13%). However, in
AdFOXO1;AAA-transduced U87 cells, treatment with CDK2iII
restored their susceptibility to cell death, with 54.5 F 8.3% cells
undergoing death at 48 h compared with 20.1 F 6.5% in untreated
cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data suggest that
the transient effect of AdFOXO1;AAA on the expression of cell cycle
and apoptotic proteins in U87 may occur through regulation of
S249 phosphorylation by CDK1 and CDK2.

Discussion
Molecular characterization of glioblastoma multiforme has led
to development of therapies targeting specific defects. For example,
activation of EGFR occurs in f50% of primary glioblastoma
multiforme (35) and thus provides an obvious target. However, only
f10% of patients show some modest response to EGFR kinase
inhibitors (36). Glioblastoma multiforme is characterized by frequent, concurrent dysregulation of several growth factor receptor
tyrosine kinase pathways (37), which may explain the poor efficacy
of single treatments. Hyperactivation of PI3K-Akt signaling follows
from dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and can
lead to excessive cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
Recently, PI3K-Akt signaling was shown to be altered in 88%
of analyzed glioblastoma multiforme tumor samples (35). We
reasoned that a mutant FOXO1 transcription factor, which cannot
be negatively regulated by Akt phosphorylation, may act distally to
target multiple growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathways.
Indeed, in an intracerebral mouse model with a preestablished
glioma xenograft tumor, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of
FOXO1;AAA led to prolonged survival. As well, in vitro experiments
showed dose-dependent restoration of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. However, differential cytotoxicity of AdFOXO1;AAA
was noted both in vivo and in vitro, with U251 cells being more
sensitive to AdFOXO1;AAA-induced death than U87, U343, and
U373 cells (Fig. 2). The relatively lower capacity for AdFOXO1;AAA
to induce apoptosis in U87 cells, compared with U251 cells,
resulted in failure to improve survival in U87 xenografts (Fig. 1). In
contrast, tumor eradication and prolongation of survival was
achieved in the U251N xenografts, in which 33% of tumorimplanted mice were still alive at the end of the 1 year observation
period (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). These data indicate that
although U87 and U251 glioma cells both exhibit a mutant PTEN
tumor suppressor, individual genetic changes likely affect outcome.
Such discordance was also observed after infection with AdPTEN,
which resulted in anoikis in U251 cells (38), whereas G1 cell cycle
arrest occurred in U87 cells (39, 40).
Transduction efficiencies in U87 and U251 cells were relatively
similar (Figs. 2C, 3A, and 6A), but subcellular localization of the
FOXO1 protein was very different between the two cell lines. In
U251 cells, FOXO1;AAA was almost exclusively nuclear (Fig. 5A),
whereas it was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
U87 cells at 48 h postinfection, suggesting that fewer FOXO1;AAA
proteins were engaged in transcriptional activity than in U251 cells.
Cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1;AAA was unexpected, as this
mutant is considered by many to be constitutively nuclear (16, 19,
30). Subcellular localization of wild-type FOXO1 is controlled

Effect of FOXO1 on Glioma Cells

primarily by phosphorylation, leading to nuclear export and
subsequent repression of transcriptional activity (21, 23, 41, 42).
Akt phosphorylation in the DNA-binding domain (S256) results in
disruption of the nuclear localization signal and DNA binding as
well as exposing T24 and S319 to Akt phosphorylation, facilitating
nuclear export. Wild-type FOXO1 is also phosphorylated by other
protein kinases, such as SGK (43), CK1 (44), and DYRK1A (45).
Activation of Akt, and/or SGK, CK1, and DYRK1A leads to phosphorylation of a stretch of four serine residues in FOXO1, which
form an acidic patch inducing high-affinity binding of 14-3-3
proteins, thereby assisting nuclear export (41, 46). FOXO1;AAA,
however, cannot be phosphorylated by Akt nor can it be phosphorylated by SGK (43) or CK1 (46). Therefore, control of FOXO1;
AAA subcellular localization may be independent of phosphorylation at T24, S256, and S319.
CDK2 (47) and, more recently, CDK1 (48, 49) were reported to
regulate FOXO1 by phosphorylation on S249, which is unaltered in
our phosphosite mutant. CDK2 phosphorylation on S249 leads to
cytoplasmic localization and decreased activity in both wild-type
and FOXO1;AAA in a p53-independent fashion as measured by
target gene expression (47). Indeed, in U87 cells treated with the
CDK2 inhibitor, CDK2iII, we observed increased nuclear localization of FOXO1 protein (Fig. 5B and C). Furthermore, the ratio of
phospho-FOXO1 on S249 to total FOXO1 protein was much greater
in U87 cells than in U251 cells (Fig. 6A and B). These data suggest
that the decreased sensitivity of U87 cells to AdFOXO1;AAAinduced death may be related to increased levels of S249 phosphorylation of FOXO1 and subsequent decreased FOXO1 activity.

www.aacrjournals.org

As predicted, treatment of U87 cells with CDK2iII reduced the level
of S249 phosphorylation and increased their susceptibility to cell
death (Fig. 6). Thus, the transient effect of AdFOXO1;AAA in U87
cells on expression of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins and the
increased cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1;AAA may be due to
FOXO1 S249 phosphorylation.
Our results show that FOXO1 transcription factor, which acts at
a convergence point of several growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinase pathways, can effectively induce cell death and inhibit
tumor growth of glioma cells. These studies also highlight the
complexities of targeting the PI3K-Akt pathway, even distally.
However, combination therapy in which both FOXO1 phosphorylation and nuclear export (50) are inhibited may provide a wider
application and increase efficacy in a variety of tumor genotypes.
