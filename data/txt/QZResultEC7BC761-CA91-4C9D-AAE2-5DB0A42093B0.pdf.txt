Abstract

Author Manuscript

The question whether tumorigenic cancer stem cells exist in human melanomas has arisen
recently1. Here we show that in melanomas, tumor stem cells (MTSC) can be isolated
prospectively as a highly enriched CD271+ MTSC population using a process that maximizes
viable cell transplantation1,6. In this study the tumors sampled were taken from a broad spectrum
of sites and stages. High viability FACS isolated cells resuspended in a matrigel vehicle were
implanted into T, B, and NK deficient Rag2−/− γc−/− mice (RG) mice. The CD271+ subset of

cells was the tumor initiating population in 9/10 melanomas tested. Transplantation of isolated
melanoma cells into engrafted human skin or bone in RG mice resulted in melanoma from
CD271+ but not CD271− cells. We also showed that tumors transplanted by CD271+ patient cells
were capable of metastasis in-vivo. Importantly, CD271+ melanoma cells lacked expression of
TYR, MART and MAGE in 86%, 69% and 68% of melanoma patients respectively suggesting
why T cell therapies directed at these antigens usually result in only temporary tumor shrinkage.

Cancers derive by clonal progression to appear as abnormal growths. At diagnosis, they can
be at a stage ranging from low risk of metastasis and likely cure, to highly aggressive with a
marked tendency for metastasis. We proposed that at early stages, the self-renewing,
minority tumorigenic population can differentiate nonmalignant progeny, and at later stages
the self-renewing cancer cell population may become the dominant population in a
tumor2-4. Identifications of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in solid tumors3, 5-9 provided
evidence that CSC appear to recapitulate the developmental program of corresponding
normal tissue stem or progenitor cells, although in an incomplete and disorganized
manner10. Malignant melanomas, like normal melanocytes, derive from the neural crest
lineage11. The prospective isolation of mammalian neural crest stem cells was achieved by
sorting for the CD271 cell subset12. Expression of CD271 has been found on a number of
human neural crest derived tissues and in some human cancers including melanomas13, 14.
Therefore, we searched for melanoma tumor initiating cells by testing surgical patient
samples with monoclonal antibody (Mab) to CD271 as well as with Mabs to other cell
surface antigens involved in maturation of melanocytes and/or melanoma development
(Supplementary Table 1).

Melanomas can quickly progress from localized cutaneous disease to regional lymph node
and more advanced visceral metastasis. A broad spectrum of freshly resected melanomas
that included primary cutaneous lesions as well as nodal, in-transit, and cutaneous metastasis
(Supplementary Table 2) were used to profile expression of CD271 and other candidate
MTSC markers by FACS. After analyzing multiple samples, we found that CD271 was the
most reliable cell surface molecule in distinguishing heterogeneous populations within
melanomas (Supplementary Table 1). CD271 was found to be heterogeneously expressed in
9 out of 10 melanomas analyzed comprising from ~2.5% to ~41% (mean=16.7%) of the
total cell population (Supplementary Fig. 1).

In order to assess the presence of MTSC and to avoid factors which could allow selection of
the most aggressive tumor subsets during passaging, our cells were isolated directly from
surgical patient samples and transplanted using the recently reported melanoma in-vivo
transplantation assay1 (see Methods and Supplemental Section). Strikingly, we found that
the CD271+ cell population isolated directly from six different patients transplanted
melanomas in RG mice at a dramatically higher rate as compared to CD271− or Lin- (bulk
population) cells obtained from the same tumor (Fig. 1), (Supplementary Fig. 2-4;
Supplementary Table 3). In doses ranging from 10 to 105 cells, CD271+ cells engrafted in
70% (26/37) of the transplants compared to 7% (3/41) of CD271− (p < 0.0001) and 16%
(5/30) of Lin- cells (p < 0.0001). Some melanomas were too small for direct analysis, and in
these cases pieces of freshly resected tumors were transplanted subcutaneously onto the

back of RG mice (Xeno P0, n=3). Alternatively, xenografts were established from cells
amplified in-vitro for 1-2 passages (Xeno Pi, n=2) after being isolated from patient tumors.
CD271+ expression in xenografted tumors varied from 6.4% to 75.3% (mean=26.3%) of the
total cell population (Supplementary Fig. 5). The CD271+ population isolated from
xenografted tumors engrafted growing melanomas in 72% of CD271+ cell injections (26/36)
compared to 20% tumor engraftment from CD271− cells (5/25) (p=0.0001) (Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. 6a, 7-9).

Further, we wished to determine whether newly identified MTSCs were capable of selfrenewal and differentiation in-vivo. First, we analyzed engrafted melanomas derived from
purified CD271+ cells. All but one tumor redeveloped both CD271+ and CD271− cell
populations with very similar proportions of positive and negative cells as compared to the
cancer samples from which they were initially purified (Supplementary Fig. 10). We tested
whether the CD271+ and/or the CD271− cells from xenografts representing two different
patients were able to secondarily transplant melanoma in-vivo; 72.2% (13/18) of the samples
of CD271+ cells engrafted growing melanomas, compared to 27.7% (5/18) for CD271−
cells (p=0.009), in cell doses ranging from 10 to 5×103 injected cells (Supplementary Fig.
6b). Altogether CD271+ melanoma cells isolated from xenografted samples engrafted at
72% (39/54) compared to 23% (10/43) for CD271− cells (p<0.0001) (Table 3) that required
higher cell doses and longer latency.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our tumorigenic assays with surgical and xeno transplanted melanomas
described above provide strong evidence that in most patients MTSCs reside in the CD271+
fraction, which are able not only to induce tumors but also to re-establish the original
CD271 expression heterogeneity of the primary tumor. It is important to note however, that
there was an increase in combined engraftment efficiency of CD271− cells isolated from
xenopassaged melanomas compared to the combined engraftment frequency of CD271−
cells isolated from surgical samples (Table 3). In addition, in our experiments with
established melanoma cell lines we observed that unfractionated cells were able to engraft at
100% frequencies from as little as 10 cells (Supplementary Fig. 11). These results, suggest
that melanoma cells kept for prolonged periods of time in-vitro as cell cultures or in-vivo as
passaged xenografts continue to undergo malignant progression, such that successful
subclones emerge, in some samples independent of their cell surface immunophenotype.
Additional experiments would be required to understand precise molecular mechanisms
underlying tumorigenic evolutions of cells during their passaging in-vitro or in-vivo, and
their relationship to the patient's tumor.

Author Manuscript

Further we wished to determine whether MTSCs can be identified in the context of more
physiologically relevant human tissue micro-environment. We therefore created humanized
mice by grafting fragments of normal human skin or bone onto the back of RG and NSG
mice (see supplementary section). CD271+ but not CD271− cells isolated from two
independent primary dermal melanomas (Mel43 and Mel826) induced tumors in the human
skin grafts (Fig. 2a-b). Similarly, CD271+ cells but not CD271− cells isolated from
melanoma adjacent to the patella (Mel 210) formed a tumor in NSG mouse grafted with
human bone fragment (Fig. 2c).

The poor survival rate of melanoma patients diagnosed with advanced stages is due to the
high metastatic potential of this cancer that rapidly invades lungs, liver, brain and other
organs. Organ analysis of the humanized mouse injected intradermaly with Mel826 CD271+
patient's cells revealed that these cells had metastasized into the lungs and caused formation
of metastatic nodules (Fig. 2b). In-vivo intradermal tumorigenic assays of melanomas
surgically removed from two additional patients Mel1119 and Mel213 have demonstrated
that tumors formed by CD271+ cells had the ability to form metastases in the liver
(Supplementary Fig. 2b) and lung (Supplementary Fig. 4a-b), while no tumors nor
metastases were observed in matching mice injected with CD271− cells isolated from the
same patients. These results show that CD271+ MTSCs give rise to cell population in the
tumor capable of metastasis. Expression of CD271 in primary melanomas has been
previously associated with perineural invasivion15; in addition, other groups have shown
that CD271 and its ligand NGF can regulate invasive properties of metastatic melanoma cell
lines in-vitro16, 17. Further studies will be required to elucidate precise molecular
mechanisms driving metastatic progression of CD271+ cells in-vivo.

Pioneering studies of T cell immunity to melanoma antigens18, 19 have led to
immunotherapy trials20. Multiple immunotherapies based on the well defined melanoma
tumor antigens (MTAs) such as Tyrosinase, MART/MELAN-A and other have had limited
success in melanoma patients21, 22. Our IHC expression analysis of Mel327, Mel525 and
Mel425 tumor sections with CD271 Mab and with MTA Mab cocktail (Tyr/MART/
HMB-45) revealed that the CD271+ cells driving melanoma progression lack expression of
those markers (Fig. 3a). At the same time MAGE family proteins (MAGE C1, C2) were
found to be expressed on a higher fraction of CD271+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 14) of the
same patients. Next, we used melanoma tissue arrays to individually assess expression of
MTAs (TYR, MART1, MAGE (C1-C2)) and CD271 in multiple melanoma patients. In 86%
(42/49), 69% (31/45) and 68% (28/41) of melanoma patients CD271+ tumor cells either
completely or partially lacked expression of TYR, MART1 and MAGE(C1-C2) respectively
(Fig. 3b-d; Supplementary Fig. 15-27). These results uncover possible limitations of existing
melanoma immunotherapies, and can be used to argue in favour of new approaches that will
be directed at all MTSCs in a tumor, as well as their progeny.

Author Manuscript

In this study, the neural crest stem cell marker, CD271, was implicated as a cancer stem cell
marker, allowing identification and prospective isolation of melanoma cancer stem cells.
Previous studies on human melanoma have found several candidate markers that
unequivocally identify within the tumor a cancer stem cell population23, 24. A recent
report1 using principally metastatic melanoma cells isolated either from patients lymph
nodes or from tumors passaged by serial xenografts in mice revealed frequencies of ~1 in 2
to ~1 in 8 cells that are tumor initiating. That study has been popularly characterized as
showing that in melanoma there are no cancer stem cells and that in fact, all cells in a cancer
may be equally tumorigenic25-27. Our data based on transplantation of a broad spectrum of
both primary and advanced stage melanomas contradicts those conclusions. Importantly,
differences in MTSC frequencies are not due to the mouse strains used (RG vs. NSG) as
revealed in our direct comparison of their tumor cell engraftment sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig. 13). In the studies of hematopoietic cancers we and others found that a continuous
selection of more malignant cell subsets occurs28, 29 and that it might be triggered by

oncogenic mutations affecting early stages of HSC differentiation30. This opens the
possibility that during cancer progression the entire tumor may be made up of less and of
more aggressive malignant clones. The extreme of this view is that some subclones may
emerge (either as a result of passaging or disease progression) that largely or completely fail
to differentiate non-tumorigenic subsets. This view could reconcile the data presented here
with a previous report1. Melanomas are intrinsically extremely aggressive tumors and can
quickly undergo tumorigenic evolution towards more malignant stages. Our data is
consistent with the possibility that some metastatic melanomas may have very high
frequencies of tumorigenic cells (for example in Mel415 Supplementary Fig. 12) similar to
the rare outlier cases in other cancers3. The most crucial test of the TSC hypothesis is that
markers or pathways restricted to TSCs can be targets for curative therapies in the patient,
which has not yet been done. Conversely, therapies targeting markers on the progeny of
TSCs, but not on TSCs themselves, should be less efficient. MTAs (TYR, MART-1, MAGE
C1-C2) used during induced or adoptive T cell immune responses are expressed at high
frequencies on CD271− cells, (Supplementary Fig. 28) but are either completely or partially
lacking on the CD271+ cells of the significant proportion of melanoma patients analyzed.
Existing immunotherapies fail to completely eradicate melanomas19, 20, perhaps because
all MTSCs also need to be eliminated. Identification of MTSCs by their cell surface
immunophenotype may allow patient by patient selection for more efficient
immunotherapies and/or drugs to be tested in clinical trials.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Tumor tissues were digested into single cell suspension as previously described6, 7, 9.
Tumor cell suspensions were stained with anti human CD271 antibodies directly conjugated
to Biotin (557195 BD Pharmingen) or Alexa Fluor 647 (560326 BD Pharmingen) and a
human lineage cocktail of Mabs directly or custom conjugated to pacific blue: anti-CD45
(4528 Invitrogen), CD2 (555324 BD Pharmingen), CD3 555329 BD Pharmingen), CD31
(303114 Biolegend); in case of xenografted tumors the following antibodies to mouse
lineage markers were used: H2Kd (553565 BD PharMingen), CD45.2 (109820 Biolegend)
and mTer119 (557915 BD PharMingen) directly conjugated to pacific blue or FITC. All
antibodies were used in a 1:50 dilution except H2Kd (1:100) to allow separation of mouse
cells. Propidium iodide was used to exclude nonviable cells. Flow cytometry analysis and
cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) under 20 psi with a 100μm nozzle.

Author Manuscript

During FACS isolation of candidate MTSC populations we adopted the strategy of setting
up negative and positive sort gates at least one log apart to prevent cross-contamination
between negative and positive cell fractions that might occur when low expressing positive
cells cannot be distinguished from negative cells with a high degree of probability. FACSsorted tumor cells were counted in hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA) and
graded numbers of cells were suspended in a volume of 50 μl of media containing 30%
Standard Matrigel (354234 BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Suspension was then
injected by 31-gauge insulin syringes (Becton Dickinson) intradermaly on the flank of B-,
T- and NK cell deficient 4 to 8 weeks old RG mice anesthetized with isoflurane-O2.

Primary Tumor Implantation
RG mice were anesthetized with isoflurane-O2 and small pieces (<2 mm) of fresh tumor
were implanted on both sides of the flank. The incision was sealed with surgical staple.
Tumor Digestion

Author Manuscript

Tumors were minced with a razor blade, and then placed in a solution of liberase
blendzymes 2 and 4 (Roche) in Media 199 (Invitrogen) at 37°C for up to 3h to allow
complete cell dissociation with pipetting every 30 min. Cells were filtered through 40μm
nylon mesh, treated with LCK buffer to eliminate erythrocytes and washed twice with
HBSS/2% Heat Inactivated Calf Serum (HICS). Cells were stained for flow cytometry or
injected into mice as whole-tumor single-cell suspensions.
Analysis and Cell Separation by Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

The single-cell suspensions were washed in HBSS/2% HICS and counted and then
resuspended in 100 μl per 106 cells of HBSS and incubated with 1 mg/ml Sandoglobin for
10 min. The suspensions were then washed with HBSS/2% HICS, resuspended in 100 μl per
106 cells of HBSS, and stained with antibodies. Anti-CD271 (biotin-, or Alexa Fluor647 conjugated, BD Pharmingen), at a 1:50 dilution; lineage markers diluted at 1:50 anti-CD45,
CD2, CD3, CD31 directly or custom conjugated to pacific blue were used to allow
identification of contaminating nontumor cells from patient samples. Tumors that had been
passaged in the mouse were incubated with anti-H2kd (diluted 1:100; BD Pharmingen) antimCD45.2 and mTer119. Antibodies were directly conjugated to Pacific Blue or FITC,
Stained cells were washed and resuspended at 0.5 ml per 106 cells with Hoechst 33342 or
propidium iodide to allow exclusion of nonviable cells. Flow cytometry analysis and cell
sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) under 20 psi with a 100-μm
nozzle.
Single-Cell Suspension Injections

Author Manuscript

FACS-sorted tumor cells were counted in hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham,
PA) and graded numbers of cells were suspended in a volume of 50 μl of media containing
30% standard Matrigel (354234 BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Suspension was then
injected by 31-gauge insulin syringes (Becton Dickinson) intradermaly on the flank of B-,
T- and NK cell deficient 4 to 8 weeks old RG mice anesthetized with isoflurane-O2.
Humanized Mice Models
Generation of RG mice with grafted human skin: briefly, full thickness human skin sample
was obtained under signed consent from patients undergoing breast reduction,
abdominoplasty or face lift. Adult mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane in
100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2L per minute. The dorsum of the mouse was shaved with an

electric clipper and then treated with a depilatory agent to completely remove the hair.
Following sterile prep, a rectangular area of approximately 1 – 1.5 cm by 1 – 1.5 cm of skin
was resected leaving the panniculus carnosus intact. Human skin graft was sutured in place
with 6-0 prolene and covered with a non-adhesive dry dressing. Mice are then allowed to
recover from anesthesia in a warm chamber then housed individually in separate cages.

Generation of NSG mice with grafted human bone: briefly, human abortuses' bones were
obtained from Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc. Adult mice are anesthetized by
inhalation of isoflurane. 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2L per minute will
be used. A small patch of fur is shaved, and a small (2mm) incision is made in the skin. A
pair of blunt forceps is used to generate a small pocket underneath the skin and a small (5
mm) piece of aborted long bone is inserted into the pocket. The incision is then closed with
a single wound clip. A 10 microliter volume of 2% Iidocaine:1/100000 epinephrine is
applied to the wound site, which provides analgesic for a period of 2 hours. Mice are then
allowed to recover from anesthesia in a warm chamber then housed individually in separated
cage.
Tissue Immunofluorescence

A small piece of tumor specimen was kept aside and frozen in optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) embedding media. Seven-micron sections were cut, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 4
min, and air-dried. Slides were then rinsed in PBS, and blocked in PBS with 1% BSA, 5%
goat serum (for extracellular antigens) and 1% BSA, 5% goat serum and 0.01% triton-X100
(for intracellular antigens) for 30 min. Primary antibodies used: rat anti- human CD271
(27005 Abcam), Pan Melanoma cocktail (mixture of mouse anti- human Tyrosinase, MART1 and -HMB-45 antibodies) (CM165B Biocare Medical) and -MAGE(C1-C2) a kind
gift of Leonard Cohen Lab LICR New York Branch. Sections were incubated with the
primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at +4°C, washed in PBS, followed
by secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat AlexaFluor 594 and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488
(Molecular Probes)) incubation for 1h at RT. Slides were again washed, incubated with
Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 min, rinsed in PBS, and coverslipped with
Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Staining was analyzed under
LeicaDM4000B microscope. Pictures were taken under 40x objective and scale bars are
equal to 50um
Melanoma Tissue Array Immunostaining

Author Manuscript

Paraffin melanoma tissue array slides (US Biomax Inc) containing 80 1.5mm tissue cores
from primary and metastatic melanoma patients were deparaffinized through three changes
of xylene, incubating 10 min in each change. Slides were hydrated to water by dipping them
20-30 times in each of two changes of 100% ethanol, two changes of 95% ethanol, one of
80% ethanol, one of 70 % ethanol, and two changes of distilled water. Slides were placed in
microwave, covered with 50mM TRIS/20mM EDTA pH 9.0 buffer and microwaved for 15
minutes. Slides were cooled for 30 minutes, rinsed in distilled water twice and once in PBS
for 5 minutes. Three tissue array slides were stained each with the following antibody
combination: CD271 (abcam ab3125 R5) 1:100 & TYR (novacastra #NCL-L-TYROS) 1:20;
CD271 1:100 & Mart-1 (biocare #CM077) 1:400; CD271 1:100 & MAGE (abcam ab60049)

1:50 for 45 minutes at RT. Slides were washed for 15 minutes in PBS. The following
fluorescent secondary antibodies at 1:100 were used to visualize each antigen: goat anti
mouse IgG1_AF594 for CD271, goat anti mouse IgG2a_AF647 for TYR, goat anti
rabbit_AF647 for MAGE, goat anti mouse IgG2b_AF647 for MART1. Slides were
