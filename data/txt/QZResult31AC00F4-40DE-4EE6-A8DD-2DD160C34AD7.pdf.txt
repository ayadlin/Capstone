ABSTRACT
Understanding therapeutic mechanisms of drug anticancer cytotoxicity represents
a key challenge in preclinical testing. Here we have performed a meta-analysis
of publicly available tumor cell line growth inhibition assays (~ 70 assays from 6
independent experimental groups covering ~ 500 000 molecules) with the primary
goal of understanding molecular therapeutic mechanisms of cancer cytotoxicity. To
implement this we have collected currently available information on protein targets for
molecules that were tested in the assays. We used a statistical methodology to identify
protein targets overrepresented among molecules exhibiting cancer cytotoxicity with
the particular focus of identifying overrepresented patterns consisting of several
proteins (i.e. proteins “A” and “B” and “C”). Our analysis demonstrates that targeting
individual proteins can result in a significant increase (up to 50-fold) of the observed
odds for a molecule to be an efficient inhibitor of tumour cell line growth. However,
further insight into potential molecular mechanisms reveals a multi-target mode of
action: targeting a pattern of several proteins drastically increases the observed odds
(up to 500-fold) for a molecule to be tumour cytotoxic. In contrast, molecules targeting
only one protein but not targeting an additional set of proteins tend to be nontoxic. Our
findings support a poly-pharmacology drug discovery paradigm, demonstrating that
anticancer cytotoxicity is a product, in most cases, of multi-target mode of drug action.

INTRODUCTION

alternative [13]. In this case, drugs are specially designed
to act on multiple targets (a predefined pattern of proteins)
and, therefore, could offer superior efficiency[14].
Although developed to target a specific protein, most
currently efficient anticancer drugs are, in fact, essentially
poly-pharmacological: they target multiple off-target
proteins which might play important, yet unrecognized,
roles in the mechanism of action [11, 13-15].
Considering the positive and negative features
of poly-pharmacology paradigm, there has been no
systematic exploration of whether molecules exhibiting
anticancer cytotoxic activity act, as a general rule, in
single or multi target mode. To answer this question we
undertook a meta-analysis of currently available tumor cell

In recent years, the dogma in cancer drug discovery
has been the design of selective drugs that target a single
protein believed to be critically important for cancer
development [1, 2]. Despite an improved understanding of
cancer biology, and discovery of multiple genes involved
in cancer development and pathology[3-9], the number
of successful outcomes for the target-centric approach in
anticancer drug design remains disappointingly low[10].
The reason for this could be that cancer pathology involves
multiple genes sometimes acting in parallel [11, 12]. From
this perspective, poly-pharmacology-based strategies
(multi-target drug strategies) represent an attractive

line growth inhibition assays[16]. In total we examined
about 70 assays generated by several independent groups
(see Table 1) covering in total approximately 500 000
unique molecules. By examining PubChem BioAssay[16]
and DrugBank[17] data repositories, we were able to
collect experimentally detected protein targets for these
molecules. Up to 200 000 molecules have at least one
target, either known from the literature or found to inhibit/
activate the protein in target oriented screening assays.
More than 50 000 molecules were known to target at least
5 proteins. This large scale molecule-to-target information
has been used to explore potential therapeutic mechanisms
of cancer cytotoxicity in tumor growth inhibition assays.
In the first step we look for “one target” models, i.e.
for each assay we identified overrepresented targets among
cytotoxic molecules. The results, at first glance, would seem
to support the “one target centric” drug discovery paradigm:
targeting individual proteins significantly increases the
observed odds for a molecule to exhibit strong cancer
cytotoxicity. For the top protein targets, depending on the
assay, odds ratio [18] varies from 10 to 80 (the odds ratio
shows the increase of odds for the molecule to be cytotoxic
in the assay if the molecule is known to target the protein
in comparison to the odds for all other tested molecules).
Moreover, for the topmost targets the odds ratios are
relatively consistent across all available assays, despite the
fact that the assays were generated using different cancer
models and relatively independent chemical libraries.
In spite of this seemingly impressive statistical
link between tumour cytotoxicity of a molecule and its
ability to target a single protein, deeper analysis of the
data convincingly proves that anticancer cytotoxicity is
a product, in the majority of cases, of multi-target action
mechanisms. First we demonstrate that if a molecule
targets a pattern of multiple proteins (i.e. protein “A”
and “B” and “C”) then the odds for the molecule to be
tumour cytotoxic increases up to 500 fold (see Table 5).
Second, we demonstrated that the observed enrichment of
“one target” models is just a consequence of the protein
involvement in several multi-target models. To prove this,
for each enriched “one target” model we eliminated from
consideration molecules which target a predefined pattern
of proteins (i.e. we excluded from consideration molecules
which target protein A and either of proteins B, C, D, etc.
where protein A is the enriched target of interest and
proteins B, C, D are partners of protein “A” in the enriched
multi-target patterns). In every such case, molecules
targeting only protein “A” and not targeting proteins (B,
C, D ..) have not been overrepresented among cytotoxic
molecules in the assay (i.e. targeting only protein A alone
does not in general increase chances for a molecule to be
tumour cytotoxic; to be tumour cytotoxic, it is imperative
for the molecule to target along with protein A also
either protein B, C, D etc.). This emphasises that multitarget drug action mechanisms mostly explain anticancer
cytotoxic activity of the molecules observed in the assays.

Tumor cell line Growth Inhibition assays
We collected publicly available tumor cell line
growth inhibition assays. The NCI60 anticancer drug
screens include 60 different cell lines covering a wide
range of cancer types[19]. We also included several
alternative assays developed recently[20, 21]. In total,
we used assays developed by 6 independent experimental
groups (different cell line models and chemical libraries
have been used among assays). The data were downloaded
from the PubChem BioAssay repository. In each assay,
molecules are classified (classification according to the
PubChem BioAssay internal model) into two groups,
active and inactive. Active molecules are those which
efficiently inhibit tumor cell line growth at relevant
concentrations[16]. A summary of these assays is
presented in Table 1. The last column provides statistics
on the number of tested and active molecules with at least
one known protein target.

Large scale integration of small molecules to
protein target data from public sources
The PubChem BioAssay repository stores results of
biochemical assays (including HTS), both phenotypic and
target oriented. Target oriented assays, in simple terms,
can be interpreted as a subset of small molecules found
to inhibit (in rare cases to activate) the target protein [2].
The abundance of this information from the PubChem
BioAssay repository [16] can be integrated on a large scale
to derive binding spectra for approximately one million
molecules across a panel of several hundred proteins.
This information, although incomplete (some molecules
were tested across more than 300 proteins while others
only across less than a dozen), can be used to identify
molecular mechanisms which unite groups of compounds
efficiently inhibiting tumor cell line growth.
We also integrated Drug Bank [17] data for known
targets as well as known off-targets for the approved
and experimental drugs (some of the approved and
experimental drugs are often tested in different assays).
The diagram in Figure S1 (supplementary material)
presents the distribution of the number of known targets
for molecules tested in the assays listed in Table S1
(supplementary material). For example, 234 939 molecules
have at least one experimentally validated protein target,
145 365 of them have at least two, and so on.

target genes other than “NCOA3”. From Table 2 we can
see that targeting individual proteins increases the odds
for a molecule to be cytotoxic in the IGROV1 Ovarian
cell line.
Similar enrichment of individual targets can be
seen in all other tumour growth inhibition assays. The
top enriched targets for HCT116 cells with a targeted
deletion of the PTEN gene are reported in Table 3.
We can see that MITF, IDH1 and CFTR are among
the top enriched targets with strikingly high observed
odds ratios. Results for other assays are reported in
supplementary material.

Considering only individual targets leads to the
identification of multiple proteins whose inhibition
increases by up to 10–20 fold the observed odds for a
molecule to exhibit cancer cytotoxicity. The list of top
targets for the IGROV1 Ovarian cell line (NCI60, assay
ID 101) is presented in Table 3. For example, NCOA3
was ranked as a top target by p-value of enrichment among
active molecules: 68 compounds (out of 231 “active” with
at least one experimentally validated target) are known to
inhibit NCOA3. In contrast, among the “inactive” group
only 37 compounds (out of 2004) are known to inhibit
NCOA3. Thus, the odds for molecules known to target
“NCOA3” to be “active” in the assay is computed as
68/37 = 1.84 while the odds for molecules not targeting
“NCOA3” to be “active” in the assay is computed as
(231-68)/(2004-37) = 0.08. Thus, the odds ratio is 22.2.
The odds ratio is a measure which is commonly used to
estimate the influence of various factors between two
measured outcomes [18] (in our case the outcomes are
whether the compound is cytotoxic or not, and the factor
is whether the compound targets the gene product or not).
The odds ratio of 22.2 indicates that the observed odds for
molecules targeting “NCOA3” to be cancer cytotoxic is
22 times high than for the molecules which are known to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Multi-target models
Next we analysed multi-target patterns, i.e. pairs
and triplets of proteins (which we refer to as polypharmacological models). Multi-target pattern, if targeted
by a molecule, increases the odds for the molecule to
exhibit cancer cytotoxicity in comparison to the odds for
single proteins from the pattern. For example, patterns
related to “NCOA3” and the IGROV1 Ovarian cell line
are presented in Table 4. We can see a significant increase
in the odds for molecules targeting pairs of proteins. For
example, odds for the pattern “NCOA3 and NR2E3” are

Similar improvements in the odds ratios are found
in other assays using different cancer models (targeted
gene deletion, cancer stem cells, etc.) and employing
independent chemical libraries. Table 5 reports the top
enriched multi target models in growth inhibition assay
for HCT116 cells with a targeted deletion of the PTEN

impressive odds ratio of 78.6. However, targeting the

increases the odds ratio still further to 500; 117 molecules
which are known to target all 3 genes have demonstrated
anticancer cytotoxicity while only 16 molecules targeting

Here we show that the observed odds ratios related
to a single protein are, in most cases, a consequence
of essentially multi-target mechanisms of action. To
demonstrate this, we applied the following procedure. For
each significant “one target” model (referred to as protein
“A”) we filtered out from consideration molecules which
also target one (or several) proteins from those that form
significant polypharmacological patterns with protein
“A” (referred to as proteins “B”, “C”, …). The aim of the
procedure is to see whether molecules targeting protein
“A” but not targeting either of the proteins “B”, “C”, ..
retain high odds of cytotoxic predictability.

The top single protein model (“NCOA3”) for
IGROV1 Ovarian cell line (Table 3) gives an odds
ratio of 22 with 68 active molecules and only 37
inactive molecules targeting “NCOA3”. However, 60
active  molecules also target “NR5A2” while only 22
inactive molecules do so. The odds ratio for molecules
targeting “NCOA3” but not targeting “NR5A2” drops to 6
(8 active molecules and only 15 inactive molecules).
Finally, if we filter out molecules targeting “NFE2L2”
then the odds ratio drops further to 1.1 with only 1 active
and 11 inactive molecules known to target (“NCOA3”)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but not either “NR5A2” or “NFE2L2”. This discloses that
molecules targeting only “NCOA3” show no increase in
potency to inhibit tumour cell growth.
The same is true for all other single protein models
in all considered tumour growth inhibition assays. For
example, in spite of much more impressive statistics for
the MITF model (odds ratio 78, see Table 5) in HCT116
cells with a targeted deletion of the PTEN gene, the same
analysis revealed underlying multi-target mechanisms.
For example, filtering out molecules which target both
MITF and ATXN2 resulted in a drop in odds ratio from

78 to 42 with 209 active and 433 inactive molecules.
Next, filtering GMNN and IDH1 resulted in a fall in
odds ratio to 20 (67 active and 259 inactive molecules).
Finally, repeating the iterative procedure for MAP4K2,
SMAD3, CXCR6, EHMT2, KCNJ1, HCRTR1, CTDSP1,
CHRM5, NCF1, GSTO1, CASP1, ARRB1, INS, NPSR1
and PTBP1 reduced the final odds ratio to 1.6 with only
3 active and 160 inactive molecules which target MITF
and target none of the 18 other targets. Therefore, despite
the initial impressive odds ratio for MITF, as a single
target, after dissecting those molecules which are known
to target one or several proteins from the list of 18 proteins
(MITF polypharmacological partners in the assay), we see
that the remaining molecules which target only MITF are
not overrepresented among molecules that inhibit HCT116
cell growth.
Similar results are observed in the other assays used
in our study. We present a similar analysis for assay 2717
(inhibitors of cancer stem cell growth) and assay 431 (cell
viability assay with HPDE-C7K cells) in supplementary
material. In the first case, we considered EPAS1 as a
single target and provided similar statistics for multitarget patterns with EPAS1 (supplementary material,
Tables S2 and S3) as described above for MITF. Similar,
molecules targeting EPAS1 but not targeting 5 other genes
tend to be nontoxic (supplementary material, Table S4).
The same analysis was performed for IDH1 gene with
the similar outcome (supplementary material, Tables S5,
S6 and S7).

pattern has not even been presumed to be targeted.
For example, Sunitinib is an oral, small-molecule,
multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was
approved initially by the FDA for the treatment of renal
cell carcinoma [22]. Though it was developed as multitargeted drug, Sunitinib was presumed to target tyrosine
kinases specifically [17]. However, as is apparent from
PubChem target oriented screens (approved drugs are
frequently present in various chemical libraries and,
thus, could be screened versus a wide range of targets),
Sunitinib efficiently targets more than 150 proteins with
a very diverse functional background. Again, Tamoxifen
is assumed to be a selective estrogen receptor modulator
[23]. Like Sunitinib, Tamoxifen has been tested in multiple
target oriented screens and has demonstrated the ability to
modulate up to 70 other proteins. This shows clearly that
most of the currently approved anticancer agents are, in
fact, essentially poly-pharmocological.

DISCUSSION
Multi-target based strategies are attracting increased
attention as an alternative approach to discover potent
anticancer agents. In contrast to the one target centred
approach, which concentrates on promiscuous drugs
inhibiting/activating exclusively one protein (or a group of
very functionally related proteins), the polypharmocology
paradigm is based on multi-target-oriented drugs able to
inhibit/activate a predefined pattern of multiple proteins.
However, there has been no systematic exploration whether
multi-target molecules would demonstrate high efficiency.
Here we have undertaken a first large scale analysis of
available tumor cell line growth inhibition assays with the
primary aim of understanding whether efficient anticancer
molecules target a single protein or have multi-target
mechanisms of action. Our analysis convincingly proves
that inhibition of only one target (if we exclude molecules
which also target other proteins) results in no increase of
odds for a molecule to be an efficient inhibitor in tumor
cell line growth inhibition assays, while inhibition of
multi-target patterns of proteins drastically increases the
odds for anticancer activity up to 500 fold (see Table 5).
The improved efficiency of multi-target drugs is
likely, in part, to result from their ability to prevent cell

approved

Although many of the currently approved anticancer
agents were designed within a single target oriented
approach they, in fact, target multiple proteins. We
summarise data for several anticancer agents in Table 6.
As can be seen, most anticancer agents inhibit the activity
of hundreds of proteins. In these cases, the efficacy of the
drugs could be attributed to the fact that all of them target
multiple proteins with very diverse functions. Thus, even
being designed to affect a single target, the efficiency of
the agent is a consequence of a cryptic multi-target action
mechanism. Indeed, the targeted poly-pharmacology

compensatory mechanisms in response to inhibition of a
single protein. Cancer cells can readily switch on alternative
pathways, thus reducing the drug efficiency achieved by
inhibition/activation of a single protein. The same response
in the case of inhibition of multiple proteins would be
predicted to be much less efficient. In principle, our
approach can be used to identify multi-target protein patterns
whose inhibition leads to a high probability that a molecule
is cytotoxic for cancer cells. In addition, targeting several
targets can cause selective cytotoxicity of the molecule to
cancer cells, while sparing normal cells [24, 25].
Finally, we would like to emphasise that although
we have collected almost all available information
regarding experimentally validated protein targets for
small molecules which have been tested in tumor cell line
growth inhibition assays, the information is obviously
incomplete as only roughly 400 proteins are covered
and even for those the information is not systematic
(some molecules were tested against several hundred
proteins while most against only a few dozen). This only
strengthens the conclusion of the paper that, in most
cases, anticancer cytotoxicity is a product of multi-target
action mechanisms. Because the missing information can
only reduce the number of active molecules which target
only one protein, we would therefore probably see no
molecules at all which can produce anticancer cytotoxic
effects by targeting only one protein.

Drug Bank [17] is a database of currently accepted
drug protein targets and drug off targets. The data were
downloaded from http://www.drugbank.ca/downloads.
Overall statistics for the number of targets for molecules
(including data both from DrugBank and Pubchem
Bioassays) tested in tumor cell line growth inhibition
assays are presented in supplementary material (Table S1
and figure S1).

Inference of Therapeutic models of cancer
cytotoxicity
To identify single target therapeutic models for each
assay we repeated the following procedure [26, 27]. Let
us denote KA to be the number of active molecules in
the assay and KB to be the number of inactive. For each
protein “Z” we calculated two numbers, kA is the number
of active molecules which are known target “Z” and kB
is the number of inactive molecules which target Z. Odds
for the molecules (to be active) targeting “Z” is (kA/kB)
while the same odds for the molecules which do not target
“Z” is ((KA-kA)/(KB- kB)). The odds ratio is (kA/kB) /
((KA-kA)/(KB- kB)) and indicates the increase/decrease
of odds of a molecule to be cytotoxic if the molecule is
known to target protein “Z”. The odds ratios for all targets
are computed. Significance of the odds ratio is computed
using X2-distribution and adjustment of p-values for
multiple testing (each target is one hypothesis) and is
performed by the FDR procedure[28].
Similarly, to identify multi-target therapeutic
models, we computed similar statistics (kA and kB) but
in this case for all pairs (triplets, etc) of targets. In this
case, for each pair of targets “Z1” and “Z2”, kA is the
number of active molecules which are known to target
both “Z1 and Z2” and kB is the number of inactive
molecules which target both “Z1 and Z2”. The number
of tested hypothesis is equal, in this case, to all possible
pair (triplet, etc) combinations of targets. The p-values are
adjusted accordingly [27, 29, 30].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor cell line Growth Inhibition assays
We collected publicly available tumor cell line
growth inhibition assays (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubchem/Bioassay/). The summary of assays used in
our study is presented in Table 1. We used the Pubchem
Bioassays model which classifies molecules tested in an
anticancer assay into active (producing tumour growth
inhibition) and inactive.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest

Molecule- to- protein target data: Pubchem
Bioassays and Drug Bank

No potential conflicts of interest.
Supplementary Materials are available at HTML file.

We have integrated two sources of data regarding
protein targets of small molecules. Pubchem Bioassays
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Bioassay/) deposits
target oriented compound screens (including high
throughput and literature derived information) across a
wide range of protein targets [16]. Molecules in Pubchem
Bioassays target oriented screens are classified as active,
inactive and inconclusive. In simple terms, molecules
classified as active have demonstrated inhibition/activation
of the protein at relevant concentrations. Active molecules
are considered here as molecules which target the protein.
