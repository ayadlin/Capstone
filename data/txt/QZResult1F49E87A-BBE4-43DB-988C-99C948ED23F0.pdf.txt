ABSTRACT
Compelling efficacy on intervention of tumorigenesis by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been documented intensively. However, the
toxicities related to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition resulting in suppression of
physiologically important prostaglandins limit their clinical use for human cancer
chemoprevention. A novel derivative of the NSAID sulindac sulfide (SS), referred as
sulindac sulfide amide (SSA), was recently developed, which lacks COX inhibitory
activity, yet shows greater suppressive effect than SS on growth of various cancer
cells. In this study, we focus on the inhibitory activity of SSA on breast tumor cell
motility, which has not been studied previously. Our results show that SSA treatment
at non-cytotoxic concentrations can specifically reduce breast tumor cell motility
without influencing tumor cell growth, and the mechanism of action involves the
suppression of TGFβ signaling by directly blocking Smad2/3 phosphorylation.
Moreover, miR-21, a well-documented oncogenic miRNA for promoting tumor cell
metastasis, was also found to be involved in inhibitory activity of SSA in breast tumor
cell motility through the modulation of TGFβ pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate
that a non-COX inhibitory derivative of sulindac can inhibit breast tumor metastasis
by a mechanism involving the TGFβ/miR-21 signaling axis.

considered to be the mechanism responsible for the cancer
chemopreventive activity of NSAIDs [8, 9]. Unfortunately,
the long-term use of NSAIDs for cancer chemoprevention
is not recommended because of gastrointestinal, renal, or
cardiovascular toxicities associated with the depletion of
physiologically important prostaglandins resulting from
COX-2 inhibition [10, 11]. However, different studies
have also reported that distinct mechanisms from COX
inhibition could be fully or partially responsible for the
cancer chemoprevention activity of NSAIDs [12–15].
Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of
death among women in the United States [16]. According
to American Cancer Society, the 5-year survival rate for
patients with non-metastatic breast cancer is 99%; whereas
the rate is dramatically reduced to 25% for the individuals

INTRODUCTION
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are commonly used to treat a variety of inflammatory
conditions and pain associated with arthritis. Previous
studies have reported promising cancer chemopreventive
activity from regular use of aspirin and other NSAIDs
for a variety of malignancies including breast cancer,
colon cancer, and other solid tumors [1–4]. In particular,
the NSAID, sulindac has been shown to reduce the size
and number of precancerous adenomas in patients with
familial or sporadic adenomatous polyposis [5–7].
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition is often regarded
as the pharmacological basis responsible for the antiinflammatory properties of NSAIDs, which is also

growth both in vitro and in vivo [18]. Here, by studying the
anti-metastatic activity of SSA, for the first time, we report
that SSA can inhibit motility of a panel of breast tumor
cells at concentrations less than those required to inhibit
tumor cell growth. The mechanism of action involves
suppression of TGFβ signaling by directly blocking the
phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Moreover, miR-21, a welldocumented oncogenic miRNA for promoting tumor cell
metastasis, was also found to be involved in the inhibitory
activity of SSA in breast tumor cell motility through the
modulation of TGFβ pathway. Therefore, our results
provide novel evidence of anti-metastatic activity for a
non-COX inhibitory derivative of sulindac, SSA in breast
cancer and demonstrate that the mechanism of action
involves suppression of the TGFβ/miR-21 pathway.

with distant metastases [17]. Therefore, effective and safe
chemopreventive agents to inhibit tumor progression and
metastasis are urgently needed in the clinic. With regard to
breast cancer, epidemiological studies have reported that
NSAIDs can significantly reduce breast cancer incidence,
recurrence and the risk of death [1, 2]. For example,
a large population-based study that was conducted by
the Women’s Health Initiative followed 80,741 postmenopausal women for more than 8 years and determined
that the long-term use of aspirin can reduce breast cancer
risk by 21% [1]. A recent study also reported that the daily
use of aspirin could reduce the risk of death from solid
tumor metastasis by up to 48% based on meta-analyses of
a large number of randomized controlled clinical trials [3].
These studies highlight important anti-cancer activities of
NSAIDs not only to prevent tumor progression, but also
to suppress metastasis. The tumor cell growth inhibitory
activity of NSAIDs is considered to partially attribute to
their ability in prevention of tumor progression, while the
mechanism responsible for their suppressive effect on
tumor metastasis is largely unknown.
Sulindac sulfide amide (SSA) is a recently
characterized amide derivative of the NSAID, sulindac
sulfide (SS). It has no COX inhibitory properties, but
shows improved potency to inhibit colon tumor cell

RESULTS
SSA inhibits tumor cell motility at sub-cytotoxic
concentrations
SSA is an amide derivative of SS lacking COX
inhibitory properties but with potent tumor cell growth
inhibitory activity compared with SS [18]. The chemical
structure of SSA and SS are shown in Figure 1a to illustrate

growth inhibitory activity was evaluated by using Cell Titer-Glo Assay, which measures viable cell numbers based on ATP content. The relative
cell viability was computed and the growth inhibition curve was plotted in which IC50 was calculated by using GraphPad Prism 6.

Anti-invasive activity of SSA involves
suppression of TGFβ signaling

the substitution of the carboxylic acid with a dimethylethyl
amide moiety. A panel of breast cancer cells, including
MCF-7, BT-20, SKBR-3, and MDA-MB-231 cells was
employed in this study to investigate the anti-metastastic
activity of SSA. First, the cytotoxicity of SS and SSA
was determined after 36 h of treatment. The results
showed that the growth inhibitory potency of SSA was
approximately 10 times greater than SS in all four breast
tumor cell (Figure 1b and 1c). Using a protocol as reported
previously [19], we determined the effect of non-cytotoxic
concentrations of SSA on tumor cell invasion, and we
found that SSA treatment at 4 μM for 36 h significantly
inhibited the invasion of highly metastatic breast cancer
cell lines, MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and SKBR-3 (Figure
2). We also studied the inhibitory effect of SSA (4 μM,
36 h) on tumor cell migration in the same cell lines by
using a wound-healing assay, which showed similar
inhibitory activity (Supplementary Figure S1). These data
demonstrate that SSA can inhibit breast tumor cell invasion
and migration at non-cytotoxic concentrations; whereas we
previously reported that SS has similar activity on breast
and colon tumor cells but at a concentration (50 μM) over
10 times higher than SSA [19].

We previously reported that the blockade of
NF-κB signaling by SS is one of the key mechanisms
associated with its anti-invasive activity [19]. Hence,
we are interested in examining if the same mechanism
of action is involved in SSA inhibitory activity as well.
By employing the NF-κB immunofluorescence assay,
we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with TNFα to induce the
translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Then SS and SSA
were added at non-cytotoxic concentrations. As shown in
Figure 3, SS, but not SSA, attenuated the inductive effect
of TNFα on accumulation of nuclear NF-κB. These results
suggest a distinct mechanism from suppression of NF-κB
is responsible for SSA anti-invasive activity, which may
be consistent with its inability to inhibit COX activity.
Multiple studies have reported that TGFβ
signaling plays an important role in tumor progression
and metastasis [20–22]. To determine if inhibition of
TGFβ signaling mediates that anti-invasive activity of
SSA, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with TGFβ1 at
a concentration of 30 ng/ml to induce cell motility prior

to the post-treatment with SSA at 4 μM. As measured
by BD matrigel cell invasion assay, SSA was found to
attenuate the stimulatory effect of TGFβ1 on cell motility
(Figure 4). Similarly, the TGFβ1 receptor inhibitor,
SB431542, inhibited TGFβ1 stimulation of tumor cell
motility to an extent comparable to SSA. These results
suggest that SSA inhibits breast tumor cell invasion by
suppressing TGFβ receptor-mediated signaling.
To further study this possibility, MCF-7 breast tumor
cells, a well-known non-invasive breast tumor cell model,
were treated with 30 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 36 h to induce tumor
cell motility by referring to the published protocol [23,
24]. As shown in Figure 5, TGFβ1 significantly stimulated
motility of MCF-7 cells as measured by the woundhealing assay; whereas SSA treatment at 4 μM effectively
attenuated the stimulatory effect of TGFβ1. These results
further support that SSA inhibition of breast tumor cell
motility involves the suppression of TGFβ signaling.

following the treatment with TGFβ1. The translocation
and accumulation of the complex of phospho (p)-Smad2/3
and Smad4 in nucleus are key events for transduction of
TGFβ receptor-mediated signaling [25]. As shown in
Figure 6a, SSA significantly reduced the phosphorylation
of Smad2 and Smad3, and attenuated the inductive effect
of TGFβ1 treatment without interruption of the expression
of total Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. In addition, the
expression levels of p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and Smad4 in
the nucleus of MCF-7 breast tumor cells were measured
by immunofluorescence microscopy, and we found that
SSA could reduce the level of p-Smad2/3 in the nucleus
with or without the presence of TGFβ1(Figure 6b). These
results suggest that the mechanism by which SSA inhibits
TGFβ signaling involves inhibition of Smad2 and Smad3
phosphorylation.

MiR-21 is involved in anti-invasive activity of
SSA when targeted by TGFβ/Smad2/3

SSA suppresses TGFβ signaling by blocking
phosphorylation of Smad2/3

MiR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 are
oncogenic miRNAs that have been well-documented
to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis in
numerous studies [26–29]. We previously reported
that SS downregulates these miRNAs by suppressing

To further define the mechanism by which SSA

NF-κB signaling [19]. In this study, we are interested
in determining if these miRNAs are also involved in
anti-invasive activity of SSA. In MCF-7 cells showing
increased motility after TGFβ1 treatment, we examined
the expression of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR9, but found only miR-21 was upregulated (Figure
7a). We therefore studied the influence of SSA on
miR-21 expression in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells.
As shown in Figure 7b, overexpression of miR-21 by
transfection of its mimics can increase the invasion of
MDA-MB-231 cells; while SSA not only reduced cell
invasion, but also attenuated the promoting effect of
miR-21. These results suggest that miR-21 can mediate
the inhibitory effect of SSA on breast tumor cell
invasion and that the effects of SSA appear to be more
specific when compared with SS.
To further study the involvement of miR-21,
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
different concentrations of TGFβ1 in the presence or
absence of SSA, and the expression of miR-21 was
measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 7c and

7d, TGFβ1 upregulated miR-21 expression in a dosedependent manner, while SSA attenuated the inductive
effect of TGFβ1 on the expression of miR-21. The
interaction between SSA and TGFβ to regulate miR21 expression was further validated by using SSA
and TGFβ1 at various concentrations as well as their
combinations. Obviously, higher concentrations of
TGFβ1 show more significant attenuation on SSA
suppression of miR-21. These results suggest that
downregulation of miR-21 by SSA might be through
modulation of TGFβ signaling.
We next used a ChIP assay to determine the
regulation of miR-21 expression by TGFβ. In the promoter
of miR-21, we identified two binding sites of p-Smad3,
SBS1 (ATGCATTCT) and SBS2 (AAGTCAGAGAG), as
reported previously [30, 31]. Then, the sheared chromatin
from MCF-7 cells pretreated with TGFβ1 was precipitated
by using anti-phosphorylated Smad3 antibody. After
isolated DNA fragments from the pull-down complex, we
performed PCR to amplify the target fragments including
SBS1 and SBS2 sequences. As shown in Figure 8, the

TGFβ1 (30 ng/ml), TGFβ1+SSA, and TGFβ1+SB431542 (TGFβ1 receptor inhibitors, 10 μM). Five microscopic fields randomly chosen
from each assay were counted individually, and the statistical significance between different treatments and vehicle control was determined

DISCUSSION

expected bands were found, demonstrating that the DNA
fragments immunoprecipitated by the anti-phosphorylated
Smad3 antibody contain the promoter sequences of miR-21.
To further study the interaction between SSA and
TGFβ signaling in regulation of miR-21 expression, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells were treated with
4 μM SSA, 30 ng/ml TGFβ1, and their combination,
respectively. The TGFβ1 receptor inhibitor, SB431542
was included as the control. As shown in Figure 9, TGFβ1
treatment induced the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which
in turn, led to upregulation of miR-21 in both breast
tumor cell lines; whereas SSA reduced miR-21 expression
through inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation. SB431542
showed a similar phenotype to SSA, which demonstrates
the direct inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation by SSA.
These results show that the transcriptional regulation of
TGFβ on miR-21 expression depends on the direct binding
of p-Smad2/3 to the promoter regions of miR-21.

Previous studies have documented that long term
administration with NSAIDs can reduce the risk of
death and malignant recurrence in breast cancer patients
[1, 2]. However, their use for cancer chemoprevention is not
recommended because of potentially fatal toxicities resulting
from inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and suppression
of prostaglandins synthesis [10, 11]. SSA is a novel amide
derivative of SS, which lacks COX inhibitory activity, yet
displays potent growth inhibitory activity against colon
tumor cells [18]. SSA was previously reported to have
anti-tumor activity in the HT29 colon tumor xenograft
mouse model and the TRAMP mouse model of prostate
tumorigenesis [18, 32]. The mechanism responsible for its
tumor cell growth inhibitory activity involves the induction
of autophagic cell death by suppressing Akt/mTOR signaling
as recently reported in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines [33].

However, there are no studies that have investigated the
anti-metastatic activity of SSA in human cancers. Given
its potential for greater anticancer efficacy and reduced
toxicity as compared to sulindac, we studied the possibility
that SSA inhibits tumor cell metastasis and investigated the
underlying mechanism. By evaluating a panel of highly
aggressive human breast tumor cell lines, including MDAMB-231, BT-20, and SKBR-3 cells, SSA was found to
significantly inhibit tumor cell growth with more than 10
times greater potency compared to SS. Impressively, SSA
was found to inhibit tumor cell invasion and migration
at sub-cytotoxic concentrations and was at least 10 times
more potent than SS compared to our previous observation
[19]. Given that SSA is chemically identical to SS with the
exception of the carboxylic acid moiety that is necessary for
COX binding, these results provide insight into novel COXindependent mechanisms responsible for the anti-metastatic
activity of sulindac and support the feasibility of developing
safer and more efficacious derivatives for breast cancer
patients with malignant disease.

We previously reported that SS can inhibit the
invasion of human breast and colorectal tumor cells
through suppressing NF-κB-mediated transcription of a
panel of oncogenic miRNAs [19]. However, in this study,
we found that SSA was appreciably less effective than SS
to inhibit NF-κB signaling. Given recent studies reporting
that TGFβ signaling plays an important role in tumor
progression and metastasis [20–22], we examined the
ability of SSA to inhibit TGFβ signaling using the human
metastatic breast tumor cell line, MDA-MB-231. Our
results showed that SSA not only inhibited the invasion of
MDA-MB-231 cells, but also attenuated the stimulatory
effect of TGFβ on tumor cell motility. Using previously
published protocols [23, 24], we induced migration of a
non-metastatic human breast tumor cell line, MCF-7 by
TGFβ1. Intriguingly, SSA showed compelling inhibitory
effects on migration induced by TGFβ1. These results
lead us to conclude that the blockade of TGFβ signaling
is involved in the inhibitory effect of SSA on breast tumor
cell motility.

TGFβ binds to specific receptors on the cell
membrane, leading to the formation of the complex
consisting of phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4. This
complex can enter the nucleus where it regulates target
gene expression at the transcriptional level [34]. Our
results show that SSA can inhibit the phosphorylation

of Smad2/3 without interrupting total Smad2/3/4 levels
in breast cancer cells. In the recent studies, the NSAID,
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) was reported to inhibit
TGFβ signaling by blocking phosphorylated Smad2/3
to enter the nucleus in colorectal cancer cells [35]; and
tolfenamic acid was found to inhibit the phosphorylation

of Smad2/3 by interacting with the MAP kinase pathway
[36]. These results suggest that the disruption of Smad2/3
phosphorylation may be a key mechanism responsible for
the anti-cancer activity of NSAIDs.
MiRNAs have been well documented as “master”
regulators of gene expression, and are broadly involved in
normal and pathological processes including tumorigenesis
37, 38]. For example, miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR9, are considered as oncogenic miRNAs because of their
association with tumor cell proliferation and metastasis
[26–29]. We recently reported that SS can inhibit breast
and colorectal tumor cell invasion by downregulating
these oncogenic miRNAs through the modulation of NFκB signaling [19]. In this study, we found that SSA only
alters the expression of miR-21 through a distinct pathway,
TGFβ. MiR-21 has been documented for its oncogenic
role in malignant transformation, invasion and metastasis
[39], and its elevation was found to correlate with lymph
node metastasis in patients with breast cancer [40]. The
mechanism by which miR-21 promotes tumor invasion
and metastasis is associated with its ability to repress
multiple tumor suppressor genes, including tropomyosin
1 (TPM1), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), and maspin
[41]. Previous reports showed that TGFβ1 can induce
miR-21 by promoting the processing of the Smad2/Drosha
complex, or enhancing the biogenesis of miR-21 through
Smad3/4 mediated transcription [30, 42, 43]. In this study,
we show that phosphorylated Smad2/3 can directly bind
to the promoter of the miR-21 gene to upregulate its
expression through the transcriptional control. In addition,
we found that TGFβ1 can induce miR-21 expression
in a dose-dependent manner, while SSA significantly
attenuated TGFβ1-induced miR-21 expression in breast
tumor cells.
Small molecule inhibitors of TGFβ1 receptor
have been reported to reduce the oncogenic activity of
TGFβ1, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition
and tumor metastasis [44, 45]. For example, SB-431542
was shown to suppress tumor progression by inhibiting
the transcriptional activity of p-Smad2/3 [46]. In this
study, we found that SSA could mimic the inhibitory
effect of SB-431542 on phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in
both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. In
addition, SSA countered TGFβ1 upregulation of miR-21
expression by inhibiting phosphorylation of Smad2/3,
which is similar to SB-431542. Therefore, our results
support that downregulation of miR-21 is responsible for
the inhibitory effect of SSA on breast tumor cell motility
through blockade of TGFβ signaling.
This is the first study to demonstrate the antimetastatic activity of SSA in human cancer. SSA is
the non-COX inhibitory derivative with improved
efficacy and potency when compared to its parent
compound, SS. Our study demonstrates that SSA
can inhibit the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and
thereby impede the transduction of the oncogenic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TGFβ signaling into the nucleus. MiR-21 is known
to promote tumor metastasis, and we find that miR21 can be downregulated by SSA through modulating
TGFβ signaling. In conclusion, our results not only
support the pronounced inhibitory effect of SSA on
breast tumor metastasis, but also demonstrate that
TGFβ/miR-21 pathway is involved in its mechanism
of action. These observations provide critical insight
into development of new sulindac derivatives with
improved efficacy and reduced toxicity to inhibit
tumor progression and metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and compounds
The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, BT-20,
SKBR-3, and MDA-MB-231, were purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA). The Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells), Minimum
Essential Medium (BT-20 cells), and McCoy's 5a Medium
(SKBR-3 cells) were purchased from Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA, USA), and used for tissue culture after
mixing with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals,
Lawrenceville, GA, USA) The cells were maintained in 37°C
and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. SSA was synthesized
in Dr. Piazza’s lab as previously reported [18]; SS was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA);
TGFβ1 was purchased from PromoCell GmbH (Heidelberg,
Germany); and TGFβ1 receptor inhibitor, SB431542, was
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA).

Cell growth inhibitory activity was examined using
Cell Titer-Glo Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA),
which measures viable cells based on ATP contents. In
brief, MCF-7, BT-20, SKBR-3, and MDA-MB-231 cells
were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells
per well and incubated for 12 h before the treatments.
Then, cells were treated with 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150,

SSA for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h. At the end of the
incubation, the relative cell viability was computed and
the growth inhibition curve was plotted in which IC50
was calculated by using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software, CA, USA).

Invasion assay
Cell invasion was measured by the Biocoat
matrigel invasion chamber kit from BD Bioscience

cells in 500 μl blank medium were added to the upper
chamber, and then 750 μl chemoattractant containing
10% FBS was added to the lower compartment. Cells
were then incubated in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C
for 36 h. After removing non-invading cells by using
a clean cotton swab, invading cells were fixed with
formaldehyde and then stained with crystal violet
before counting. For each assay, five randomly chosen
microscopic fields were counted and the average of
these numbers was recorded.

secondary goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG
antibodies (Bio-Rad) were incubated with blots for 1 h
at room temperature. After incubating with enhanced
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Worcester, MA, USA), the imaging were visualized by
G:BOX Chemi Imager (Syngene, Cambridge, England).

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol® (Life
Technologies) and cDNA was synthesized by a
high capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit (Life
Technologies). The stem-loop RT primers of miRNAs
were designed following the previous publication [47].
The 20 μl mixture of reverse transcription reaction
included 2 μg of total RNA, 2 μM reverse transcription
primers, 2 μl 10× reverse transcription buffer, 0.8 μl
100 mM dNTP and nuclease-free water. The reverse
transcription reaction was performed at 37°C for 2
h. The 20 μl mixture of quantitative real-time PCR
reaction contain 10 μl 2× SYBR master mix (Roche),
1 μl forward primer (7 μM) and 1 μl reverse primer
(7 μM), 1 μl cDNA and 7 μl nuclease-free water. The
real-time PCR was performed for 30 cycles on a 7500
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Each cycle of real-time PCR includes
denaturing for 10 s at 94°C, annealing and extension
for 30 s at 58°C. The comparative Ct method was
performed to analyze the relative expression of target
miRNAs [47]. PCR primer sequences are included in
Supplementary Table S1.

Wound-healing assay
Each 2 × 105 cells were seeded in a single well
of 6-well plates and cultured until near confluence
(85-95%). After serum starvation for 24 h, a sharp
pipette tip was used to scrape a straight line in the
middle of the well and the floated cells were washed
away with warm PBS. Then the cells are maintained at
37°C for observation of migration. For SSA mediated
effects, cells were treated with 4 μM SSA, 30 ng/ml
TGFβ1, vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) or incubated
simultaneously with 30 ng/ml TGFβ1 and 4 μM SSA
for 36 h. The cell migration imaging was photographed
at 0, 12, 24, 36 h using EVOS® FL Cell imaging
System (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) after scraping.
Migrating cells in the wound area were counted for
quantification. Data are presented as the average
number of migrating cells ± standard deviation in three
independent experiments.

Immunofluorescence assay

Western-blot assay

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the
flow dish overnight at 37°C and then MCF-7 cells was
treated with 4 μM SSA, 30 ng/ml TGFβ1, vehicle control
(0.1% DMSO) or combination of 4 μM SSA and 30 ng/
ml TGFβ1 for 12 h or pretreated with 4 μM SSA for 12h
before adding 30 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 1h. MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 4 μM SSA or same volume of
0.1% DMSO for 12 h. TNF-α (BD Bioscience) at a
concentration of 25 ng/ml was added to the cells for 20
min. After fixation by 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 10 min, then the cells were permeabilized with 1%
Trition X-100 (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 1% BSA
before incubation with Phospho-Smad-2-(Ser465/467)/
Smad-3-(Ser423/425) antibody (Cell signaling) and
Smad4 antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) or NF-κB P65 antibody (BD Bioscience) at
4°C overnight. After washing with PBS, the cells
were incubated with the Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated
secondary antibody (Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor®
647-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies)
for 1 h at room temperature. After washing and staining
with 5 ng/ml DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich), imaging was taken
by using Nikon Eclipse Ti Laser Confocal Scanning

Cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich)
and quantitated with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). For detection of phosphorylation,
the samples were kept on ice at all times after adding
the cocktail of protease inhibitors (Fisher Scientific)
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN, USA). The cell lysis containing denatured total
proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and
then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The
membrane was blocked with 5% BSA-TBST (BioRad) for detection of phosphorylation or 5% non-fat
milk-TBST and then incubated with mouse anti-human
α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
rabbit anti-human Smad-2 polyclonal antibody (Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit anti-human
Smad-3 polyclonal antibody (Cell signaling), rabbit
anti-human phosphorylated Smad-2 polyclonal antibody
(Cell signaling), rabbit anti-human phosphorylated
Smad-3 polyclonal antibody (Cell signaling), and
rabbit
anti-phospho-Smad-2-(Ser465/467)/Smad-3(Ser423/425) antibody (Cell signaling) at 4°C overnight.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)
ChIP analysis was performed with EZ-Magna ChIP
kit (Cat. no. 17-409) from Millipore (Billerica, MA,
USA). The procedure strictly followed the manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, 1 × 107 MCF-7 cells were cultured in
a 15-cm culture dish and treated with 30 ng/ml TGFβ1 for
1 h before crosslinking by using 1% formaldehyde (SigmaAldrich). The fixed cells were lysed, and the chromatin
was sheared by sonication using an optimized condition.
The chromatin fraction was immunoprecipitated overnight
at 4°C with the anti-phosphorylated Smad-3 antibody (Cell
signaling), anti-RNA polymerase antibody, and goat-antimouse IgG. The DNA was extracted and purified after the
immunoprecipitation. PCR amplification was performed
in a total volume of 20 μl with pre-designed primers, and
the sequences of primers are listed in Supplementary Table
S1. PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles consisting
of denaturing for 20s at 94°C, annealing for 30s at 59°C
and extension for 30 s at 72°C.
