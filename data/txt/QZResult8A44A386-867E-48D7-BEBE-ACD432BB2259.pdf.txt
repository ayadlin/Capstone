Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is centrally
involved in cell growth, metabolism, and angiogenesis. While
showing clinical efficacy in a subset of tumors, rapamycin and
rapalogs are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1), but they do not directly inhibit mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2), an emerging player in cancer. Here,
we report chemical structure and biological characterization
of three pyrazolopyrimidine ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, WAY-600, WYE-687, and WYE-354 (IC50, 5–9 nmol/L),
with significant selectivity over phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) isofoms (>100-fold). Unlike the rapalogs, these inhibitors acutely blocked substrate phosphorylation by mTORC1
and mTORC2 in vitro and in cells in response to growth
factor, amino acids, and hyperactive PI3K/AKT. Unlike the
inhibitors of PI3K or dual-pan PI3K/mTOR, cellular inhibition of P-S6K1(T389) and P-AKT(S473) by the pyrazolopyrimidines occurred at significantly lower inhibitor
concentrations than those of P-AKT(T308) (PI3K-PDK1
readout), showing mTOR selectivity in cellular setting. mTOR
kinase inhibitors reduced AKT downstream function and
inhibited proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines. These
effects correlated with a strong G1 cell cycle arrest in both the
rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant cells, selective
induction of apoptosis, repression of global protein synthesis,
and down-regulation of angiogenic factors. When injected
into tumor-bearing mice, WYE-354 inhibited mTORC1 and
mTORC2 and displayed robust antitumor activity in PTENnull tumors. Together, our results highlight mechanistic
differentiation between rapalogs and mTOR kinase inhibitors
in targeting cancer cell growth and survival and provide
support for clinical development of mTOR kinase inhibitors
as new cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6232–40]

Introduction
The historical discovery of the macrolide rapamycin (1) and
subsequent biological elucidation of its mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) have highlighted a great example of the
modern chemical biology that has illuminated human disease and
therapy. Today, whereas rapamycin and rapalog therapies are

already used clinically for treating allograft rejection, coronary
heart disease, and renal cancer, mTOR has attracted even more
research for new therapies, particularly for treating major solid
tumors. mTOR is the founding member of a family of unconventional high molecular mass serine/threonine protein kinases
termed phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–related kinases (PIKK;
ref. 2). The catalytic sites of the PIKK family resemble those of the
PI3Ks but differ from those of the broad-spectrum conventional
protein kinases. These distinctive structural features, coupled with
the essential biological functions and scarcity of PIKKs in the entire
human kinome of f500 kinases, highlight mTOR and the PIKK
family as exciting drug targets for the development of potent and
selective inhibitor therapy.
mTOR resides in at least two functional multiprotein complexes,
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2),
mediating diverse signals from growth factors, nutrients, and
energy supply (3–5). A prominent role in promoting cellular
translation is well established for mTORC1 through its direct
phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein 1
(4EBP1). The recently identified mTORC2 phosphorylates the
serine/threonine kinase AKT, thereby increasing its activity. mTOR
is a critical mediator of the canonical pathways of PI3K/AKT and
Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the two pathways
that are most frequently dysregulated in human malignancy (6–8).
Evidence from both epidemiologic and experimental studies
indicate that mTOR signaling contributes to both the tumorigenic
effects by numerous oncogenes such as PI3K, AKT, epidermal
growth factor receptor, HER2/neu, and BCR-Abl as well as the
effects due to loss of tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN,
tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau, and neurofibromatosis 1 (6–8). The positive regulation of AKT by mTORC2 implicates
mTOR as acting both upstream and downstream of AKT and its
diverse and complex roles in cancer cell growth, survival, and
resistance to chemotherapy.
The rapamycins (rapamycin and rapalogs) are allosteric
inhibitors that, in complex with FKBP12, target the FRB domain
adjacent to the catalytic site of mTOR (9, 10). Intriguingly, both
in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the FRB in mTORC2 is
inaccessible to rapamycins as indicated by the lack of suppression
of the mTORC2 substrate AKT (11, 12). Thus, the rapamycins are
allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, leaving the possibility of
undiscovered rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 substrates. Targeting
mTORC1 by the rapamycins is associated with clinical efficacy in a
subset of cancers (13–15). However, it is also increasingly
recognized that the rapamycin mechanism of action may not be
sufficient for achieving a broad and robust anticancer effect due to
failure to inhibit mTORC2 in some tumor types. Furthermore,

Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitors of mTOR Kinase

rapamycins can induce feedback activation of PI3K and ERK/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in certain cells (6, 7, 16).
The antiproliferative effects of the rapamycins are generally
modest and variable in cancer cells, which may reflect their
inaccessibility to mTORC2 and the complex feedback activation of
PI3K/AKT and/or ERK/MAPK. To further explore the therapeutic
potential of targeting mTOR in cancer, a strong interest now exists
for small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase as
anticancer agents. Such inhibitors will target mTORC1 and
mTORC2 and can minimize the feedback activation of PI3K and/
or ERK/MAPK. In this regard, dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
have shown enhanced antiproliferative effects against some cancer
cells with strong G1 cell cycle arrest (17, 18). Nevertheless, these
agents do not permit a direct assessment on the antitumor
potential of selective mTOR targeting. Here, through efforts in
high-throughput screening and lead optimization, we have
generated novel pyrazolopyrimidines as potent, ATP-competitive,
and selective inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We report the
biochemical profile, cellular pharmacology, and in vivo antitumor
efficacy of representative molecules.

kg WYE-354 on days 0 to 4 once daily or twice daily. Tumor growth was
monitored twice weekly and analyzed (24).

Results
Discovery of novel pyrazolopyrimidines as ATP-competitive
and selective inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Highthroughput screening of chemical library against a recombinant
mTOR enzyme discovered a small-molecule pyrazolopyrimidine
WAY-001 (IC50, 0.22 Amol/L), a lead-like compound that served as
the starting point for further optimization. WAY-001 was 6-fold more
potent against PI3Ka than against mTOR, and its phenolic group
was a potential glucuronidation site. Replacement of the phenol with
isosteric groups such as indole or methyl carbamate overcame this
potential metabolic liability while retaining the ability of these
groups to function as hydrogen bond donors. Chemical synthesis
varying the phenol isosteres as well as the piperidine substituents
identified potent and selective mTOR kinase inhibitors as exemplified by the structures WAY-600, WYE-687, and WYE-354 (Fig. 1A;
ref. 19).4 As depicted in Fig. 1B, although rapamycin and rapalogs
in complex with FKBP12 target the FRB domain in mTORC1, these
inhibitors target the catalytic sites of both mTORC1 and mTORC2.
In the DELFIA measuring His6-S6K1 T389 phosphorylation, WAY600, WYE-687, and WYE-354 inhibited recombinant mTOR enzyme
with IC50 values of 0.009, 0.007, and 0.005 Amol/L, respectively.
Significantly, the pyrazolopyrimidines were selective for mTOR
over PI3Ka (>100-fold) and PI3Kg (>500-fold) and were poorly
active in a panel of 24 protein kinases (Supplementary Table S1).
In a representative ATP matrix assay with WYE-354, doublereciprocal plots of the initial enzyme rate versus ATP concentration were well fit to competitive inhibition (Fig. 1C). To test
directly the inhibition of mTORC2 catalytic activity in vitro, we
immunoprecipitated mTORC2 and mTORC1 from HEK293 cells
and performed immune-complex kinase assay of the mTORC2specific substrate His6-AKT or the mTORC1 substrate His6-S6K.
AKT(S473) phosphorylation was dose dependently inhibited by
all three inhibitors but not by the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex
(Fig. 1D). As expected, both the kinase inhibitors and rapamycinFKBP12 complex efficiently blocked the mTORC1 substrate
S6K(T389) phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Together, the results in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1 identify WAY-600, WYE-687,
and WYE-354 as potent, ATP-competitive, and selective inhibitors
of mTOR kinase activity.
Global targeting of mTOR signaling and down-regulation of
AKT function in cellular models. We assayed the pyrazolopyrimidines in cells stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I),
amino acids, and in tumor cells expressing hyperactive PI3K/AKT/
mTOR. IGF-I–stimulated P-S6K1(T389) and P-AKT(S473) in Rat1
cells were both inhibited by these compounds (Fig. 2A, left).
Inhibition of P-AKT(S473) required higher inhibitor concentration

Figure 1. Novel pyrazolopyrimidines are ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR. A, chemical structures of three pyrazolopyrimidines. B, structural domains of mTOR and
molecular sites targeted by mTOR inhibitors. Rapamycin and rapalogs (CCI-779, RAD001, and AP23573) in complex with FKBP12 target the FRB domain in
mTORC1. ATP-competitive inhibitors target the catalytic site of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. C, inhibitor versus ATP matrix competition. The initial enzyme rate (V 0)
against 0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.015 Amol/L of WYE-354 at various concentrations of ATP was measured to generate the double-reciprocal plot.
D, immune-complex kinase assay of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Immunoprecipitated mTOR complexes were assayed to phosphorylate His6-S6K or His6-AKT. The
reactions included the indicated inhibitors and the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex (40 nmol/L). The assay products were immunoblotted with antibodies against
P-S6K(T389), P-AKT(S473) (phosphorylation products), His6 (total substrates), mTOR, rictor, and raptor.

(1 Amol/L) than that of P-S6K1(T389) (0.3 Amol/L). Notably,
P-AKT(T308), an activity marker for PI3K-PDK1, was fully inhibited
by the PI3K inhibitor HWT or a dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
PI-103 but not by the pyrazolopyrimidines at doses up to 3 Amol/L,
showing selectivity for targeting mTORC2 over PI3K. In HEK293
cells, amino acid–induced P-S6K1 and P-4EBP1 were blocked by
the pyrazolopyrimidines (Fig. 2A, right). mTOR inhibition in cancer
cell lines MDA361 (PIK3CA; HER2++) and U87MG (PTEN null) was
examined after 6-hour inhibitor exposure. Similar to the action of
rapamycin, the pyrazolopyrimidines potently inhibited the mTORC1
substrates P-S6K1(T389) and P-4EBP1(T70) (V0.3 Amol/L) in
MDA361 (Fig. 2B) and U87MG (data not shown). Notably, the
pyrazolopyrimidines but not rapamycin inhibited P-4EBP1(T37/46)
(Fig. 2B). These differential inhibitory effects on 4EBP1 phosphorylation likely play a role in regulation of protein synthesis (see
below). In MDA361, the pyrazolopyrimidines inhibited P-AKT(S473)
at low concentrations (V0.3 Amol/L), whereas they substantially
inhibited P-AKT(T308) at considerably higher concentrations
(z10 Amol/L), showing a 10- to 30-fold selectivity for mTORC2 over
PI3K (Fig. 2C, left, top). A similar trend for selective inhibition of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

P-AKT(S473) over P-AKT(T308) was also seen in U87MG (Fig. 2C,
left, bottom), whereas HWT readily inhibited both S473 and T308 in
these cell lines (Fig. 2C). A dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103
displayed a nearly identical dose response in suppression of P-S6K,
P-4EBP1, P-AKT(S473), and P-AKT(T308) (Fig. 2C, right). Additionally, we found that a prolonged exposure (20 hours) of U87MG,
MDA361, and LNCap cells to 2 Amol/L pyrazolopyrimidines did not
significantly diminish P-AKT(T308), whereas P-AKT(S473) remained
suppressed (Supplementary Fig. S1A). It was further noted that the
AKT from the pyrazolopyrimidine-treated cells exhibited a further
increased electrophoresis mobility (downward band shift) when
compared with that of HWT-treated cells, implying the possibility
of additional phosphorylation site(s) targeted by mTORC2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The pyrazolopyrimidines dose dependently reduced phosphorylation of the AKT substrates P-FKHRL1(T32) and P-GSK3(S21/9)
in MDA361 (Fig. 2D, top) and U87MG (Fig. 2D, bottom), whereas
P-ERK was not inhibited. Targeting of mTORC1 by rapamycin did
not lead to suppression of these markers (Fig. 2D). Notably, the
pyrazolopyrimidines inhibited P-FKHRL1 and P-GSK3 at higher

concentrations than those of P-AKT(S473), and the inhibition of
P-GSK3 was not complete even at optimal inhibitor concentrations
(Fig. 2C and D; data not shown). P-FKHRL1 and P-GSK3 remained
significantly suppressed after a prolonged treatment, which
correlated with the loss of P-AKT(S473) but not P-AKT(T308)
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). In a cell-based assay, several members of
the PIKK family can be activated by the cancer drug etoposide
(VP-16). VP-16–induced PIKK substrate phosphorylations of P-

p53(S15) and P-Chk1(S345) were not blocked by these inhibitors at
3 Amol/L, indicating that the underlying PIKKs were not targeted
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). In separate cell assays, the inhibitors did
not block tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)–induced activation of
IKKh (Supplementary Fig. S2B, left) or TNF-a–induced phosphorylations of MAPK cascades (Supplementary Fig. S2B, right). Taken
together, these results confirm the pyrazolopyrimidines as
selectively inhibiting cellular AKT activity via targeting mTORC2.

Profound inhibition of cap-dependent and global protein
synthesis. As rapamycin is a known inhibitor of cap-dependent
translation (25), we compared the pyrazolopyrimidines with
rapamycin in three separate translation studies (Fig. 3). The
inhibitors were first examined for effect on global protein synthesis
in MDA361 cells (Fig. 3A, left). Methionine incorporation in cells
treated with a cytotoxic dose of Taxol (92% of control) or rapamycin
(93% of control) was not significantly reduced. Interestingly, cells
treated with pyrazolopyrimidines all displayed a significant
reduction, ranging from 44.7% to 59% of control, albeit less
pronounced than the value by cycloheximide (16% of control).
Immunoblotting of these cells after 6-hour exposure to 1 or 10 Amol/L
of rapamycin indicated no suppression of P-AKT(S473)
(Fig. 3A, right). Protein lysates from inhibitor-treated cells were
subjected to 7-methyl-GTP pull-down for examination of the capdependent initiation eIF4F protein complex (Fig. 3B). The pyrazolopyrimidines induced a substantially higher increase than rapamycin
in binding of 4EBP1 to eIF4E and caused a nearly complete loss of
eIF4G compared with a moderate loss of eIF4G caused by rapamycin.
Both events are well known to disrupt the eIF4F complex, thereby

inhibiting cap-dependent translation. Lastly, the inhibitor effects on
actively translating ribosomes were examined (Fig. 3C). The P/M
ratios (polyribosomes versus the 60/80S monosomes) for DMSOtreated, rapamycin-treated, and WAY-600–treated HEK293 cells
were 1.85, 1.65, and 0.93, respectively, indicating a 50% inhibition of
polysomes by WAY-600 compared with the 11% suppression by
rapamycin. Thus, results in Fig. 3 indicate that inhibition of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 is accompanied by a profound suppression of
both the cap-dependent and global translation.
Antiproliferative effects in cancer cells involving G1 cell
cycle arrest and selective induction of apoptosis. In representative growth inhibition assays with the rapamycin-sensitive
MDA361 and U87MG cells, all three pyrazolopyrimidines elicited
a considerably more profound growth suppression than rapamycin
(Fig. 4A), which was accompanied by reduced cyclin D1 levels
(Fig. 4B). The pyrazolopyrimidines inhibited a panel of diverse
cancer cell lines with IC50 values generally in the submicromolar to
single-digit micromolar range (Supplementary Table S2). Cell cycle
profiles were analyzed in both the rapamycin-sensitive MDA361
and rapamycin-resistant HCT116 cells. After 24-hour treatment, the

were pretreated for 2 h with DMSO, 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide (CHX ), 10 Amol/L rapamycin, mTOR kinase inhibitors, or 100 ng/mL Taxol in methionine-free growth
medium and labeled with [3H]methionine. Mean values of protein synthesis in inhibitor-treated versus control cells are as follows: Taxol, 92.4%; rapamycin, 93.3%;
WAY-600, 58.6%; WYE-687, 44.7%; WYE-354, 50.9%. Right, MDA361 cells in growth medium were treated for 6 h with 1 Amol/L HWT, 20 Amol/L LY294002, and 1 and
10 Amol/L of rapamycin and immunoblotted with antibodies against P-S6K(T389), P-AKT(S473), and AKT. B, 7-methyl-GTP pull-down assay. MDA361 cells in growth
medium were treated for 16 h. Total lysates were subjected to 7-methyl-GTP pull-down. Total lysates and protein complexes obtained from the pull-down were
immunoblotted with antibodies against eIF4E, 4EBP1, eIF4G, eIF4B, eIF3b, and P-S6K(T389). C, polysome profiles. HEK293 cells in growth medium were treated for

shown. The direction of sedimentation is from left to right. P/M, the ratio of polysomes over monosomes, was calculated.

Figure 4. Antiproliferative effects of the mTOR kinase inhibitors involve G1 cell cycle arrest and selective apoptosis. A, MDA361 and U87MG cells were treated for
3 d with inhibitors. Representative dose-response curves are shown. B, MDA361 and U87MG were treated for 6 h and immunoblotted with antibodies against
cyclin D1 and h-actin. C, MDA361 and HCT116 cells were treated for 24 h with inhibitors and analyzed for cell cycle profile. Percentage of cells in G0-G1 are plotted.
D, MDA361 cells similarly treated for 24 and 48 h were analyzed for cell cycle profile. Percentage of cells in sub-G1 are plotted. E, MDA361 (left ) or LNCap, HCT116,
and HT29 (right ) cells were treated for 48 h with the indicated inhibitors and immunoblotted with antibodies against PARP, P-AKT(S473), and h-actin. Ponceau S
staining of total protein is shown.

pyrazolopyrimidines caused a dose-dependent strong G1 arrest in
both cell lines, whereas rapamycin induced a modest G1 arrest in
MDA361 and was inactive in HCT116 (Fig. 4C). Rapamycin at
higher concentrations (up to 10 Amol/L) did not further increase
G1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of MDA361 with
the pyrazolopyrimidines also led to cell death, which was readily
observed at 24 hours and peaked at 48 hours. Cell death was not
induced by rapamycin even after a prolonged exposure (Fig. 4D).
Immunoblot analysis showed PARP cleavage in the pyrazolopyrimidine-treated MDA361 cells, indicating activation of apoptotic
caspases (Fig. 4E, left). WYE-354 also induced a small but
significant amount of PARP cleavage in the PTEN-null LNCap cells
but not in HCT116 or HT29 cells (Fig. 4E, right). The results in Fig. 4
indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is associated
with a profound suppression of proliferation and selective
apoptosis in subsets of cancer cells.
Inhibition of cancer cell angiogenic factors. Rapalogs can
reduce the angiogenic properties of cancer cells by downregulating the expression and activity of HIF-1a (26–30). The
PTEN-negative U87MG glioma cells express elevated levels of VEGF
when cultured in normoxic condition in vitro and form highly
vascularized tumors in vivo. These cells were therefore examined

for effects of mTOR kinase inhibition. After 24-hour treatment,
whereas rapamycin potently but partially inhibited the level of
secreted VEGF, the pyrazolopyrimidines elicited a similar inhibition at the doses that inhibited mTOR (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the
inhibition of VEGF, both rapamycin and the pyrazolopyrimidines
caused a similar reduction in the expression of HIF-1a in U87MG,
MDA361, and LNCap cells (Fig. 5B). The observation that both the
rapamycin and pyrazolopyrimidines induced similar inhibition of
VEGF and HIF-1a indicates that these events are largely mediated
by mTORC1. Together, the results in Fig. 5 reconfirm the role of
mTOR in regulation of angiogenic signaling in cancer cells.
Inhibition of mTOR signaling and antitumor efficacy in vivo.
WYE-354 achieved significant in vivo exposure and was hence
selected for in vivo studies. Nude mice bearing the PTEN-null
PC3MM2 tumors were administered i.p. with vehicle or 50 mg/kg
WYE-354. Tumor lysates prepared at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing
were immunoblotted for levels of P-S6K(T389), P-AKT(S473), and
P-AKT(T308) (Fig. 6A). Quantification of the immunoblotting
results indicated that WYE-354 completely inhibited P-S6K(T389)
for at least 6 hours and substantially inhibited P-AKT(S473) for
6 hours (Fig. 6B). As expected, P-AKT(T308) in the same tumors was
variably but not significantly inhibited (Fig. 6B), indicating that

spread efforts in targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways have led
to the discovery of numerous small-molecule inhibitors of PI3K,
AKT, and dual-pan PI3K/mTOR (17, 18, 33–35) with several lead
candidates in cancer trials (35). To our knowledge, our study is
among the first in biological characterization of ATP-competitive
and selective inhibitors of mTOR in cancer cells.
Unlike the rapalogs, WAY-600, WYE-687, and WYE-354 acutely
blocked mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT in vitro and
in vivo. In various cancer cells, these compounds inhibited the
mTORC1 substrate P-S6K(T389) and mTORC2 substrate

Figure 5. mTOR inhibitors down-regulate angiogenic factors. A, confluent
monolayer culture of U87MG cells was fed with fresh medium with or without
inhibitors for 24 h. Levels of the secreted VEGF (normalized for cell viability) are
plotted. B, U87MG, MDA361, and LNCap cells in growth medium were treated
for 20 h with inhibitors and immunoblotted with antibodies against HIF-1a and
h-actin.

consistent with the in vitro study results, WYE-354 selectively
inhibited P-AKT(S473) via targeting mTORC2. The PTEN-null
U87MG glioma grows rapidly in nude mice and serves as a robust
and convenient efficacy model for evaluating mTOR inhibitors. In a
representative study, WYE-354 dosed at 50 mg/kg twice daily and
once daily for 5 days achieved dose-dependent suppression of
tumor growth with treated over control (T/C) values of 0.14 and 0.62
(P < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 6C). The results in Fig. 6 show that
selective targeting of mTOR via ATP-competitive mTOR kinase
inhibitor results in a substantial antitumor efficacy.

Discussion
Heightened mTOR activity, as indicated by an elevated
phosphorylation of its downstream substrates, is frequently
observed in clinical samples of various solid tumors as well as
hematopoietic malignancies. Although the rapalogs are efficacious
in a subset of clinical tumors, the lack of direct inhibition of
mTORC2 and feedback activation of PI3K and/or ERK/MAPK
associated with these compounds may limit their anticancer
potential (6, 7). Interestingly, prolonged rapamycin treatment can
inhibit P-AKT(S473) in some cells (31), and reducing level of
phosphatidic acid in renal 786-O cells can sensitize P-AKT(S473)
suppression by rapamycin (32). These reports and future studies
will help further elucidate the biochemical basis for the differential
accessibility of rapamycin to mTOR complexes. Ongoing wide-

Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitors of mTOR Kinase

P-AKT(S473) at submicromolar concentrations without significant
inhibition of P-AKT(T308). These results, together with the data
obtained from kinase panel profiling, show that WAY-600, WYE687, and WYE-354 represent a new class of selective inhibitors of
mTOR kinase. Targeting of P-AKT(S473) by these compounds
reduced AKT downstream function, a property particularly relevant
for control of tumors with hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR.
Although mTOR is a well-known positive regulator of the capdependent mRNA translation (25, 36, 37), we found that rapamycin
at the commonly studied drug concentrations did not acutely block
global protein synthesis in actively proliferating breast cancer cells
or in other cancer cells (data not shown). In sharp contrast, mTOR
kinase inhibitors significantly reduced global protein synthesis.
More detailed examination of the cap-dependent eIF4F protein
complex revealed a much stronger perturbation by the kinase
inhibitors than rapamycin, as shown by a drastic increase in the
inhibitory binding of 4EBP1 to eIF4E as well as a nearly complete
loss of the scaffolding protein eIF4G. The substantial disruption of
the eIF4F complex by the kinase inhibitors may in part reflect their
ability to efficiently suppress P-4EBP1(T37/46), two regulatory sites
that are directly phosphorylated by mTOR but are resistant to
inhibition by rapamycin (38). Additional studies indicated that
cellular polysomes were also more profoundly inhibited by the
kinase inhibitors than rapamycin. Overall, these results reconfirm
mTOR as an essential regulator of cap-dependent translation and
further reveal potential new role(s) of mTOR in protein synthesis
via mTORC2 and/or rapamycin-insensitive function of mTORC1.
Targeting tumor angiogenesis is integral to the successful
treatment of solid tumors. Indeed, deregulated overproduction of
angiogenic factors is a hallmark of cancer cell signaling that often
involves mTOR (3–5). The antitumor efficacy of the rapalogs is in
part attributed to their antiangiogenic properties mediated by the
inhibition of HIF-1a, a well-known activator of the VEGF gene
transcription (26, 28, 29, 39–43). In the highly angiogenic U87MG
and numerous prostate and breast cancer cell lines cultured in
normoxic condition, both rapamycin and mTOR kinase inhibitors
similarly reduced VEGF expression. Consistent with a role of mTOR
in growth factor–regulated production of HIF-1a, both rapamycin
and the kinase inhibitors profoundly inhibited HIF-1a in majority
of cell lines examined. These observations therefore support
previous reports and further suggest that the HIF-1a/VEGFpromoting function in normoxic growth culture primarily requires
mTORC1 in these cells.
mTOR kinase inhibitors are potent antiproliferative agents. In
several cell lines expressing hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR, these
compounds achieved submicromolar IC50. These antiproliferative
effects correlated with a loss of cyclin D1 and strong G1 cell cycle
arrest in both the rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant cells.
Interestingly, dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have been shown to
cause strong G1 arrest in PTEN-null glioma cells (17, 18). In our
studies, a substantial G1 arrest can be induced in MDA361 and

HCT116 at the inhibitor concentrations that do not target PAKT(T308). It therefore seems likely that suppression of mTORC2
and/or rapamycin-insensitive function of mTORC1 critically interfere with the G1 cell cycle progression. Although the substantial loss
of cyclin D1 in the kinase inhibitor–treated cells is consistent with G1
arrest, it is presently unknown whether this is a direct drug effect or a
consequence of the reduced growth. Strikingly, the global targeting
of mTOR resulted in apoptosis in some cancer cell lines with
hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR. These observations highlight the
fundamental importance of mTOR in growth and cell cycle
progression and reinforce the notion that subsets of PI3K/AKTderegulated cancers are dependent on mTOR for growth and
survival. These mTOR-dependent survival effects are expected to
involve the mTORC2-mediated AKT functions that can escape from
the rapalog therapy but are susceptible to mTOR kinase inhibitors.
Consistent with the in vitro pharmacology profile, WYE-354 caused a
rapid, sustained, and selective inhibition of P-S6K(T389) and PAKT(S473) in PTEN-null tumors in vivo. WYE-354 displayed a robust
antitumor activity against the PTEN-null U87MG glioma. The
antitumor efficacy was dose dependent, related to the plasma and
tumor exposures of the inhibitor concentration and to the
suppression of mTOR kinase activity in tumor tissue. In the
regimens and doses studied, WYE-354 was well tolerated with no
significant body weight loss or adverse effects.
In summary, the present mTOR kinase inhibitors have provided
new tools for elucidating the novel roles of mTOR in tumorigenesis
and for exploring selective and global mTOR inhibitors as
antitumor agents. Medicinal chemistry efforts are under way to
further improve the mTOR inhibition potency, selectivity, and
pharmaceutical properties of this inhibitor class and may lead to
new anticancer therapy.
While this article was under review, Thoreen and colleagues (44)
reported the biochemical and cellular activity of a potent, ATPcompetitive, and selective mTOR inhibitor with undisclosed chemical
structure. Feldman and colleagues (45) also reported novel pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as active site inhibitors of mTOR. Although
the studies on these chemically distinct compounds with various
different systems may not be directly compared, several observations
from the current study agree with these two reports (44, 45).
