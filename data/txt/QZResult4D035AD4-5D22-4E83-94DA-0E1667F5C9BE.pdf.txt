ABSTRACT:
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is considered one of the most challenging lymphoma,
with limited responses to current therapies. Acadesine, a nucleoside analogue has
shown antitumoral effects in different preclinical cancer models as well as in a recent
phase I/II clinical trial conducted in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here
we observed that acadesine exerted a selective antitumoral activity in the majority
of MCL cell lines and primary MCL samples, independently of adverse cytogenetic
factors. Moreover, acadesine was highly synergistic, both in vitro and in vivo, with
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, commonly used in combination therapy
for MCL. Gene expression profiling analysis in harvested tumors suggested that
acadesine modulates immune response, actin cytoskeleton organization and metal
binding, pointing out a substantial impact on metabolic processes by the nucleoside
analog. Rituximab also induced changes on metal binding and immune responses.The
combination of both drugs enhanced the gene signature corresponding to each single
agent, showing an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, metabolic stress,
apoptosis and proliferation. These effects could be important as aberrant apoptotic
and proinflammatory pathways play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MCL.
In summary, our results suggest that acadesine exerts a cytotoxic effect in MCL in
combination with rituximab, by decreasing the proliferative and survival signatures of
the disease, thus supporting the clinical examination of this strategy in MCL patients.

INTRODUCTION

[1]. MCL cells carry a high number of secondary genetic
alterations that increase the oncogenic potential of cyclin
D1 and frequently inactivate the cellular response to
DNA damage. In addition, other mechanisms such as
activation of cell survival pathways are integrated to
drive MCL pathogenesis. Current frontline combination
chemotherapies and intensive chemoimmunotherapy
followed by stem-cell transplantation have improved the

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 5-10%
of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and is one of
the most aggressive lymphoid neoplasms with poor
prognosis. Its genetic hallmark is the chromosomal
translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which leads to cyclin D1
overexpression with the consequent cell cycle deregulation

RESULTS

outcome for patients with this disease [2]. Although these
regimens have high initial response rates, most patients
relapse and die from disease-related complications [1]. The
introduction of rituximab, a chimeric mouse anti-human
CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown improvement of
response rates when used in combination with standard
chemotherapy [3;4]. In the last years, new strategies that
target crucial biological pathways such as ubiquitinproteasome system, mTOR pathway and BCR signaling
have been developed [2;5;6]. In particular, recently it
has been described that Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor shows
durable single-agent efficacy in relapsed or refractory MCL
[7]. Acadesine (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Dribofuranoside, AICA-riboside or AICAR) is a nucleoside
analogue initially developed as a cardioprotective agent,
with a different mechanism of action compared to standard
nucleoside analogues, like fludarabine [8]. When added
to cell cultures or administered to animals or humans,
acadesine is phosphorylated to AICA-ribotide (ZMP), the
natural endogenous intermediate in the de novo purine
nucleotide biosynthesis, which can function as an AMP
mimic and activate AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a
protein that regulates the responses of the cell to energy
changes [9]. Although acadesine is commonly used as
an AMPK activator, there are compelling evidences that
acadesine anti tumoral effects could be mediated, at least
in part, independently of the AMPK pathway [10-13].
Nevertheless, at present, the exact nature of the AMPKindependent effects of acadesine in leukemic cells is
not clearly understood. Many studies have shown that
acadesine can inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in
multiple myeloma [14], neuroblastoma [15], glioblastoma
[16], childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [17],
colon cancer [18], and breast and prostate cancer cell
lines [19]. In particular, acadesine exerts a pro-apoptotic
activity in a wide range of B lymphoid malignancies [20],
being cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the
most sensitive to this agent [13;21]. Recently, a phase I/II
clinical trial conducted in relapsed/refractory CLL patients
has demonstrated a remarkable activity of the drug in the
clinical settings [22].
In this study, we show that acadesine exerts a
specific antitumoral activity in the majority of MCL
cell lines and primary samples, and synergizes with
rituximab both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we
provide gene expression profiling (GEP) data on the
putative mechanisms of action of acadesine-rituximab
combination, supporting clinical examination of this
strategy in MCL patients.

Acadesine exerts a cytotoxic effect both in MCL
cell lines and MCL primary samples
Nine MCL cell lines were exposed for 24 or 48
hours to increasing doses of acadesine ranging from 0.1
to 2 mM, and IC50 and LD50 values were calculated from
data obtained by the MTT and the Annexin V assays,
respectively. As shown on Table 1, most of the cell lines
analyzed (REC-1, JEKO-1, UPN-1, JVM-2, MAVER-1
and Z-138) showed a IC50 lower than 1 mM after 48
hours of acadesine incubation. Three cell lines (MINO,
HBL-2 and GRANTA-519), showed a IC50 higher than 2
mM, the maximum dose tested. The analysis of the LD50
values followed the same pattern, being REC-1, JEKO1 and UPN-1 the most sensitive cell lines to acadesineinduced cell death, with LD50 below 1 mM after 48 hours
of incubation (Figure 1A and 1C). Z-138, JVM-2 and
MAVER-1 cell lines showed LD50 around 1.5 mM at 48
hours and, accordingly to the MTT assay results, MINO,
HBL-2 and GRANTA-519 exhibited low sensitivity to
acadesine with a not-reachable LD50. Acadesine-evoked
cell death increased in a time- and a dose-dependent
manner, as illustrated in Figure 1A. Deletion at 17p,
affecting TP53 or the total amount of copy number
alterations (CNA), including trisomies or monosomies that
carried most of the MCL cell lines (Table 1) did not affect
the susceptibility of MCL cells to acadesine.
Then, isolated tumor cells from 15 MCL samples
were exposed for 24 hours to acadesine 1 and 2 mM, and
cell viability was analyzed by annexin V labeling. As
shown on Table 1 and illustrated on figure 1C, similarly to
what observed in MCL cell lines, acadesine also induced
apoptosis in primary patient cells, even though this effect
was heterogeneous among our set of MCL primary
cultures (Figure  1B). Six out of fifteen cases (40%)
showed a response above 25 % to 1 mM acadesine, while
12 of 15 cases (80%) achieved these responses at 2 mM
acadesine, being the mean cytotoxicity at this dose 48.28 ±
27.97%. Again, no association could be observed between
the response to acadesine and the presence of TP53
anomalies and CNAs in the set of primary MCL samples
studied. Despite all of them harbored a high percentage of
tumoral B-cells (range 76-97%) (Table 1), we analyzed the
activity of acadesine in B-tumoral and the accompanying
T-cells in 10 out of the 15 MCL cases studied. Using a
triple CD19/CD3/Annexin V labeling, we found that B
tumor cells (CD19+) were significantly more sensitive to
a 2 mM dose of the drug than the normal T-cell subset,
both at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 1D, P<0.01 at 24 hours
and P<0.001 at 48 hours).
Altogether, these results suggest that acadesine
is active in the majority of MCL cell lines and primary

for 24 h with acadesine, followed by an additional 24 h
incubation with or without two different concentrations of
rituximab (20 and 40 µg/mL), except for JEKO-1 cells
where rituximab was used at 1 and 2 µg/ml. Inhibition
of proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. Then
the combination index (CI) using the Chou and Talalay
method were evaluated for each drug combination and
represented in Figure 2A. An antagonistic effect was
observed when acadesine was combined with 5 nM
bortezomib. When used in combination with bendamustine
25 µM , acadesine displayed either additive or synergistic
cytotoxic activity, depending on the MCL cell line, and
being the cell lines carrying a P53 wild type phenotype
those with the higher synergistic effect between these two
drugs. Interestingly, a synergistic effect of acadesine plus
rituximab was observed in 7 out of the 9 MCL cell lines

Acadesine and rituximab exert a synergistic
cytotoxic effect
We further investigated potential interactions of
acadesine with drugs currently approved for the treatment
of relapsed/refractory MCL, including bortezomib,
bendamustine and rituximab. For this aim, a panel of MCL
cell lines were incubated for 48 hours with two different
doses of acadesine (0.5 and 1 mM), bortezomib (2.5 and
5 nM) and bendamustine (25 and 50 µM). Rituximab
experiments were performed after incubation of cells

tested, with CI values ranging from 0.400 to 0.918, with
no correlation with any known MCL genetic alteration
(Table 1). The two remaining MCL cell lines (MAVER-1
and GRANTA-519), showed CI values closed to 1,
indicative of an additive or a slightly antagonistic effect.
In 5 MCL primary samples, the combination of
acadesine with rituximab was also synergistic at all
the concentrations tested (Table 1), being the best drug
interaction obtained with acadesine 1 mM and rituximab
40 µg/ml (mean CI = 0.597 ± 0.102, Figure 2C).
Importantly, the synergistic effect observed in primary
MCL cells was independent of the initial response to
acadesine, being rituximab able to sensitize MCL cells
and to overcome their resistance to the nucleoside analog.
To validate the specificity of the cooperation
between acadesine and rituximab in MCL, we evaluated
the cytotoxic effect of both drugs either alone or in
combination in two CLL cell lines, namely MEC-1 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MEC-2, and in a set of 4 primary CLL cultures. We
observed that in CLL cells the acadesine-combination
lacked the synergistic activity observed in MCL cells, with
CI values ranging from 1.181 to 8.336, being additive in
the MEC-1 cell line and antagonistic in the MEC-2 cell
line, as well as in all the CLL primary samples tested (data
not shown).
Altogether, these results suggest that among the
standard agents currently used in the clinical, rituximab
presents the best combinational activity with acadesine,
and that this effect may be specific for the MCL model.

antitumoral effect of this combination in a CB17SCID mouse xenograft model of MCL generated using
this cell line. Animals were randomly assigned into
different groups with 6 mice per cohort and treated with
acadesine at dose level of 400 mg/kg body weight five
days a week, rituximab at 10 mg/kg body weight once a
week, both drugs as above or the equivalent volume of
vehicle. When compared to vehicle-treated mice, after
18 days of treatment, we observed that tumor burden
was significantly reduced in mice treated either with
acadesine (P<0.01) or with rituximab (P<0.001) as single
agents. We observed a reduction in tumor size of 31.22
± 15.68% in acadesine-receiving animals and of 63.85 ±
10.88% in the rituximab arm. The combination of both
agents was significantly more effective than the two drugs
alone (P<0.001 compared to acadesine, P<0.01 respect
to rituximab) leading to an almost complete inhibition
of tumor growth (Figure 3A). Mice tolerated well the
treatment, and no effect on animal vital parameters was
reported, in any of the treatment arms. Thus, these results
suggest that the combination of acadesine with rituximab
might represent a safe and efficient therapeutic approach
for the treatment of MCL tumors.

GO terms.
Then, GSEA was used to identify the gene-sets
and pathways modulated by each treatment considering
a FDR<0.05 (Table 3). For acadesine, the statistically
significant normalized enrichment scores (NES) were
achieved by the metallothionein node (NES=-1.92)
and the WNT pathway (NES=-1.97). In tumors treated
with rituximab, we found also an enrichment of the
metallothionein node (NES=-1.86). Furthermore,
pathways involved in B/T cell calcium signaling (NES=1.87), CD40 (NES=-1.89) and NF-κB pathways (NES=1.91) were also down-regulated. A significant regulation
of all these pathways, except for WNT, was also observed
in tumors treated with the drug combination. Additionally,
we observed down-regulation of genes involved in
inflammatory response (NES=-2.02), apoptosis (NES=1.88), metabolic stress (NES=-1.87), as well as interferon
signaling (NES=-2.82) and Toll pathway (NES=-1.83),
both of them involved in inflammation (Table 3).
In an attempt to validate the relevance of some of
these profiles at the functional level, we first selected
to analyze the variation of the metallothionein node,
by immunohistochemical detection of metallothionein
proteins in the different treatment groups. For this aim,
histologic sections from representative whole tumors were
labeled with specific antibodies against metallothionein as
indicated in material and methods. As shown on figure
4D (panel MT), and in accordance with our GEP results,
down-regulation of MT staining was observed in both
acadesine- and rituximab-treated groups, that became
almost complete in the combination-treated tumors.
Regarding the immune response profile, as the
GSEA analysis identified the cytokine receptor CD40
among the main components of this profile, and as it
has been reported that CD40 participates in the survival,
cell growth, and drug resistance in MCL [23], we
performed a co-stimulation assay of JEKO-1 cells with
recombinant CD40L + interleukin-4 (IL4), followed by
cell exposure to the different drugs and determination

In order to understand the basis of the synergy
between acadesine and rituximab, we next examined
changes in gene expression profiles in a set of
representative harvested tumors from each cohort (n=3
tumors/group). We determined the differentially expressed
genes from each treatment compared to the control with
a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.2 and an absolute
fold change (FC) above 1.4 using the Rank Products
method in the TM4-MEV platform. Treating the cells
with acadesine was associated with the lowest number of
gene modulations (18 genes up-regulated and 41 genes
down-regulated), whereas after rituximab treatment
26 genes were up-regulated and 46 genes were downregulated. Acadesine and rituximab treatment affected the
expression of a much higher number of genes, being 481
genes up-regulated and 512 genes down-regulated (Figure
4A and Supplemental Table 1). To gain insight into the
biological function of the treatment-related differential
expression profiles, we conducted a gene onthology (GO)
enrichment analysis using the DAVID application. Both
acadesine and rituximab monotherapies were found to
be related to an enrichment of genes involved in metal
binding and immune response, while genes related to actin
cytoskeleton organization and immune response, were
more specifically regulated by acadesine and rituximab,
respectively. Importantly, the treatment with acadesinerituximab combination allowed to the identification of
the same GO terms, but with improved significance
(P<0.001). Additionally, an enrichment of genes related to
regulation of cell death and cell proliferation was detected
in tumors receiving this combination (Table 2). Figure
4B showed an overview of the genes modulated by the
combination clustered according to the previous described

of cell viability. As shown on figure 4D, stimulation of
MCL cells with CD40L+IL4 did not prevent the decrease
in cell proliferation either in acadesine, rituximab-, or
the combination, contrasting with what observed when
MCL cells were incubated with bortezomib. These results
suggest that CD40 pro-survival signaling does not affect
significantly the acadesine-rituximab cytotoxic activity in
MCL cells.
Next, as the actin cytoskeleton organization node
contained genes related to the migration of cells, we
performed chemotaxis assays in JEKO-1 cells exposed to
acadesine, rituximab and the combination. We observed
that both agents were able to inhibit the migration of
JEKO-1 cells, and that this effect was higher in cells
treated with the combination (Figure 4E).
Finally, and in agreement with our DAVID analysis,
showing that the regulation of cell death and proliferation
were significantly affected by acadesine-rituximab
combination in MCL tumors, by immunohistochemistry
we observed a higher expression of the activated form of
caspase-3 (figure 4C, panel act.Casp3) and a reduction
in the phosphorylation status of the proliferation marker
histone H3 (figure 4C, panel Phospho-H3), in the tumor
tissues treated with acadesine plus rituximab, when
compared to vehicle- and single agent-treated tumors.
In summary, the combination of both acadesine and
rituximab enhanced the gene signature corresponding
to each single agent, showing an enrichment of genes
involved in inflammation, metabolic stress, apoptosis
and proliferation. These effects could be important as
aberrant apoptotic and proinflammatory pathways play an
important role in the pathogenesis of MCL.

drug. The same specificity for tumoral B cells have been
described in the CLL model [21], that sharply contrasts
with the lack of selectivity of other anti-leukemic
drugs, like conventional nucleoside analogs [29]. Our
results demonstrate that MCL response to acadesine is
independent of TP53 status and that it is not affected by
the occurrence of CNAs. The situation seems to differ
from other cell types, as it has been recently described
that acadesine elicited a selective apoptotic response
in trisomic mouse embryonic fibroblasts [30] and
chromosomal instability-driven colorectal cancer cell lines
[31].
The clinical course of MCL is characterized by an
initial high response rate but a constant relapse pattern,
resulting in a poor long-term outcome [2]. It has been
reported that first-line chemotherapy including rituximab
is associated with significantly improved survival in
older patients diagnosed with MCL compared with
chemotherapy alone [3]. In the last years, the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib and bendamustine, an hybrid
drug between a nucleoside analog and an alkylating
agent, have been approved in USA for the treatment of
patients with relapsed MCL patients, either alone or in
combination with rituximab [2]. Here, we observed an
antagonistic effect between bortezomib and acadesine
whereas for bendamustine we detected an additive
or synergistic effect depending on the MCL cell line.
Our results demonstrated that rituximab is the best
useful complementary drug to use in combination with
acadesine, compared with bendamustine and bortezomib.
The efficacy of the acadesine-rituximab combination
was independent of TP53 mutational status in MCL
cells, whereas the synergism effect of acadesine plus
bendamustine was higher in cell lines with P53 wild type
phenotype, consistently with the known role of P53 in
MCL cell response to bendamustine [32]. Importantly,
this synergistic effect between acadesine and rituximab
appeared to be specific for MCL, as it was not observed
in CLL cells. The synergistic in vitro effect between
acadesine and rituximab was then confirmed in vivo
using a xenograft mouse model, where a remarkable
regression of the tumor was observed in animals dosed
with the drug combination. The antineoplastic effect of
acadesine alone has already been reported on the growth
of mice xenograft models of prostatic tumors [19], CML
[28] and retinoblastoma [33]. Our in vivo results using a
xenograft model showed that the treatment with acadesine
had a modest anti tumoral activity, suggesting that this
drug alone could have limited therapeutic application as a
single agent. In contrast, an important anti tumoral activity
was observed when combined with rituximab, leading
to almost complete inhibition of tumor growth. These
results are in agreement with the notion that rituximab
significantly improves the response rates in MCL patients
when used in combination with standard chemotherapy
[2-4], as well as with the last agents approved for the

DISCUSSION
Acadesine has demonstrated to efficiently block
cell proliferation in several tumor models, in association
with decreased fatty acid and protein synthesis [24].
Besides inhibiting cell proliferation, acadesine induces
also apoptosis in different tumor cell types [13;15;21;2527] and autophagy [28]. Recently, the first phase I/II trial
has been conducted in relapsed/refractory CLL patients
showing a manageable and safe profile and with the
conclusion that acadesine may represent a valuable agent
for the treatment of this entity [22].
In the present study we show that acadesine exerts a
pro-apoptotic effect in the majority of MCL primary cells
and cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, at
physiologically achievable doses. The LD50 values are
slightly higher than those observed in CLL cells, which
showed a LD50 of 380 ± 60 μM [21], but similar to those
reported previously in a reduced subset of MCL cases
[20]. Interestingly, the maximum acadesine dose tested
in our experiments (2 mM), did not induce apoptosis
in accompanying T-cells from any of the MCL cases
analyzed, thus arguing in favor of the specificity of the

treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL patients, like
bortezomib [34], temsirolimus [35], and lenalidomide
[36]. Based on our present results, acadesine-rituximab
may also warrant potential use in the clinical practice.
To date, there is still no absolute consensus of the
in vivo mechanism of action of rituximab or rituximabbased combination. Based on in vitro studies, rituximab
appears to mediate the depletion of B-cells by several
mechanisms that are dependent on the host immune
system, including complement-dependent and antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicities [37-39]. It has also been
proposed that rituximab might sensitize lymphoma cells
to chemotherapy, and have direct antiproliferative and
apoptotic effects [38]. Using a GEP approach, we aimed
to know the signaling pathways by which acadesine exerts
its anti-tumor effect in combination with rituximab. We
observed that the number of genes down- and up-regulated
after acadesine and rituximab treatments as single agents
was low, but that it increased notably with the combination
treatment in line with the observed tumor burden
inhibition. We found 5 GO terms differentially expressed:
metal binding, immune response, actin cytoskeleton
organization and regulation of cell death and proliferation.
Acadesine alone was able to modulate immune response,
actin cytoskeleton organization and metal binding,
having a substantial impact of the drug toward metabolic
processes, accordingly to a recent microRNA analysis
in acadesine-exposed hepatocytes [40]. Rituximab also
induced changes on metal binding and immune responses.
Accordingly, it has been reported that rituximab was
capable of inducing a calcium flux in B-cells through its
ability to associate with B-cell receptor (BCR) [41]. CD20
activity is also known to be associated with BCR activation
through the induction of Src family tyrosine kinases and
the activation of the MAPK pathway [42]. Conversely,
rituximab has been shown to inhibit BCR signaling, and
different signaling pathways involving MAPK, PI3K/
Akt, NF-κB and mTOR kinases [43]. Among the metal
binding core of genes, we observed a decrease in genes
implicated in response to metal ion and negative regulation
of cell growth, namely MT1G and MT1X, that codify
for two members of the metallothionein family, whose
expression has been reported to constitute an independent
risk factor in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [44]. We
confirmed by inmunohistochemistry the downregulation
of these metallothionein proteins in tumors from the three
treatment arms, but especially in tumors having received
the combination of drugs. Similarly, when considering
the immune response profile in the combo group by GEP
analysis, we observed an accentuated downregulation of
the CD40 signaling pathway. It has been described that
the microenvironment, including cytokines, has a central
role on MCL cell survival and drug resistance, and that the
CD40 system acts as a growth-promoting stimulus [23].
Thus, pharmacological interference with this signaling
pathway may have therapeutical relevance in MCL, as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated by the use of the CD40-targeting antibody
dacetuzumab in combination with rituximab in in vitro
and in vivo models of MCL [45]. Of special relevance, we
observed that acadesine, rituximab and their combination
were able to overcome the CD40 pro-survival effect in
MCL cells, offering a glimpse for further combination
therapy in this model. Finally, our results also showed
that acadesine and acadesine-based combination interfere
with migration in MCL cells. Accordingly, it has been
reported that acadesine significantly inhibits the growth of
tumors in nude mice xenotransplants of retinoblastoma,
by inducing apoptosis and suppressing tumor angiogenesis
and macrophage infiltration [33]. Of importance, acadesine
and rituximab combination therapy resulted in enhanced
cell death in MCL cell lines and primary tumor samples
and increased regression of tumor burden in an in vivo
murine model of MCL.
In summary, our GEP analysis, together with our
histological and functional validation studies, suggest that
by mainly decreasing the proliferative and survival gene
signatures that drive MCL cell growth, the combination
strategy associating rituximab to acadesine may represent
a new effective therapy to improve MCL patients’ outcome
and to reduce treatment-associated toxicities.

METHODS
Cell lines
Nine human MCL cell lines (GRANTA-519, JVM2, JEKO-1, Z-138, MAVER-1, REC-1, UPN-1, HBL-2
and MINO) and two CLL cell lines (MEC-1 and MEC-2)
were cultured with RPMI 1640, DMEM or IMDM media
complemented with 10-20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin/
streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were grown in a
humidified atmosphere at 37Cº with 5% carbon dioxide
and routinely tested for Mycoplasma absence by PCR.
Additionally, the genetic identity of all cell lines was
verified periodically using the AmpFISTR identifier kit
(Life Technologies). Genetic characterization of the MCL
cell lines is shown in Table 1.

Primary cultures
Primary cells were obtained from peripheral
blood samples of leukemic MCL and CLL patients
diagnosed according the WHO criteria. The study was
done in accordance with protocols approved by the
Ethic Committee of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
All patients signed an informed consent according to
the Declaration of Helsinki. Biological characteristics
of MCL cases are shown in Table 1. Mononuclear cells
were isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque
734

Oncotarget

Xenograft mouse model

(GE Healthcare) gradient and conserved within the
Hematopathology collection of our institution. Cells were
either used directly or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in
the presence of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 60% FBS and
30% RPMI 1640. Cells were cultured in a supplemented
RPMI medium likewise cell lines.

Female 6 to 8-week-old CB17-severe combined
inmunodeficiency (SCID) mice (Charles River
Laboratories Inc) were bred under pathogen-free
conditions at the animal facility of our institution using
a protocol approved by the Animal Testing Ethical
Committee of the University of Barcelona (CEAA).
Mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right
flank with 1x107 JEKO-1 cells in MatrigelTM Basement
Membrane Matrix (1:1) (Becton Dickinson). When tumors
were palpable and reached a volume of approximately
200 mm3, animals were randomly assigned into different
groups with 6 mice per cohort and treated with acadesine
at dose level of 400 mg/kg body weight five days a week,
rituximab at 10 mg/kg body weight once a week, both
drugs as above or the equivalent volume of vehicle, for
18 days. The shortest and longest diameters of the tumor
were measured with external calipers twice a week. Tumor
volume was calculated using the following standard
formula: (the shortest diameter)2 x (the longest diameter)
x 0.5. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the treatment
according to institutional guidelines. Harvested tumors
were snap-frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. medium (Sakura
Tissue Tek) or formalin-fixed before paraffin embedding
on silane-coated slides in a fully automated immunostainer
(Bond Max; Vision Biosystems).

Assays of cytotoxicity
MCL cell lines were incubated with acadesine
(kindly provided by Advancell) at doses ranging from 0.1
to 2 mM for 24 or 48 hours. Inhibition of proliferation
was measured using the MTT assay and the IC50 was
defined as the concentration of drug required to reduce
cell proliferation by 50%. Cell viability was quantified
after dual staining of cells with annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated and propidium iodide
(PI) (Bender Medsystems), followed by flow cytometry
analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest
and Paint-A-Gate softwares (Becton Dickinson). Lethal
dose 50 (LD50) was defined as the concentration of drug
required to reduce cell viability by 50%.
Primary MCL cells were incubated with acadesine
at two different doses (1 and 2 mM) for 24 hours. In
these samples, the viability of tumoral B (CD19+) and
accompanying T (CD3+) cells was simultaneously
analyzed by triple labeling of the samples with anti-CD19phycoerythrin (PE) and anti-CD3-FITC antibodies (Becton
Dickinson), and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated
annexin V (Bender Medsytems) on a FACScalibur flow
cytometer.
For bendamustine and bortezomib combinations,
MCL lines were incubated simultaneously with acadesine
(0.5 and 1 mM), and bortezomib (2.5 and 5 nM) or
bendamustine (25 and 50 μM) for 48 hours. Cytotoxicity
was analyzed by the MTT assay. Combination indexes (CI)
were analyzed with Calcusyn software (Biosoft), based in
the Chou & Talalay’s method [46]. Drug combinations
with a CI lower than 1.0 were considered as synergistic.
For acadesine-rituximab studies, cell lines were
pre-incubated for 24 hours with acadesine (0.5 and 1
mM for MCL cells and CLL cell lines, 0.1 and 0.25 for
CLL primary cases), followed by a 24 hour exposure to
20 and 40 µg/ml of rituximab (1 and 2 µg/ml for JEKO1 cells). Because rituximab induces cytotoxicity in part
by a complement-mediated mechanism [39], we added
10% of human AB plasma together with rituximab as a
source of complement proteins. Cytotoxicity and CI values
were quantified as above. When indicated, cells were
exposed to 1 μg/ml of recombinant human soluble CD40L
(rhsCD40L, Sigma) and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D Systems) 1
h before acadesine exposure.

Gene expression studies
Total RNA was extracted from 3 representative
harvested tumors of each group, using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality and quantity was determined
using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and
only high quality RNA samples were processed to
Affymetrix GeneChip HT HG-U219 arrays. Sample
preparation for microarray hybridization was performed
following Affymetrix’s protocols. Briefly, from 150 ng
of total RNA, a biotin labeled cRNA was generated by
reverse transcription. Following cRNA fragmentation, the
sample was hybridized on the GeneChip HT HG-U219
perfect-match-only (PM) Array Plate. After hybridization
and washes, scanning was processed in the Gene Titan
instrument, a fully automated array system. The analysis
of the scanned images and the determination of the signal
value for each probe set of the array were obtained with
GeneChip® Command Console® Software (AGCC)
(Affymetrix). Raw data were normalized using the Robust
Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm of the BioConductor
Affy Package.
Differential expression data analysis was carried
out using the Multiexperiment Viewer Platform (TM4MEV) [47]. To compare each treatment to the control, we
determined the number of statistically significant up- and
down-regulated genes using Rank Products methodology

Statistical analysis

[48] setting up a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.2 and
an absolute fold change (FC) above 1.4.
Gene function was assigned based on Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) tool (http://www.david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) and
Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org) in terms
of biological process and molecular function. Gene sets
with a P value below 0.05 were considered as significant.
Primary microarray data are available at the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (GSE47871).
An enrichment pathway analysis was done using the
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) desktop application
version 2.0 (GSEA, Broad Institute at MIT, Cambridge,
MA; http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) in order to find
significant gene signatures using experimentally derived
custom gene sets. Gene sets were downloaded from http://
lymphochip.nih.gov/signaturedb/index.html. A twoclass analysis with 1,000 permutations of gene sets and a
weighted metric was used. Gene sets with FDR below 0.05
were considered as significant.

All statistical analysis were performed using
GraphPad Prism 4.0 Software (Graphpad Software).
Comparison of means between two groups of samples was
evaluated by non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Results
were considered statistically significant when P≤ 0.05
(*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).

AUTHORSHIP AND DISCLOSURES

JEKO-1 cells (107 cells/mL) were washed twice and
serum-starved for 1.5 hours in FBS-free RPMI. Acadesine
1 mM and rituximab 2 μg/ml were added simultaneously
for 3 additional hours, and cells were diluted to 5 ×
106 cells/mL with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
Sigma) in RPMI. One hundred microliters (5 × 105 cells)
was added to the top chamber of a Transwell culture
polycarbonate insert with 6.5-mm diameter and 5 μm
of pore size (Corning). Inserts had been previously
transferred to wells containing 600 μL of RPMI with 200
ng/mL of human recombinant CXCL12 (Peprotech). After
3 hours of incubation at 37°C, 100 μL was collected in
triplicate from each lower chamber and counted by flow
cytometry (Attune, Life technologies) for 12 seconds
under constant flow rate. Migration is represented as the
number of CXCL12-stimulated migrating cells.
