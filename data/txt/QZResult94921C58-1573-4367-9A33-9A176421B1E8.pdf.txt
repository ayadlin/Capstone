Abstract
Although several groups have demonstrated that concomitant use of MEK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitors (MEKi/PI3Ki) can induce dramatic tumor regressions in mouse models of KRAS-mutant non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ongoing clinical trials investigating this strategy have been underwhelming to
date. While efﬁcacy may be hampered by a narrow therapeutic index, the contribution of biologic heterogeneity
in the response of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki has been largely unexplored. In this study, we ﬁnd that
most human KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines fail to undergo marked apoptosis in response to MEKi/PI3Ki, which
is key for tumor responsiveness in vivo. This heterogeneity of apoptotic response occurs despite relatively uniform induction of growth arrest. Using a targeted short hairpin RNA screen of BCL-2 family members, we identify
BIM, PUMA, and BCL-XL as key regulators of the apoptotic response induced by MEKi/PI3Ki, with decreased
expression of BIM and PUMA relative to BCL-XL in cell lines with intrinsic resistance. In addition, by modeling
adaptive resistance to MEKi/PI3Ki both in vitro and in vivo, we ﬁnd that, upon the development of resistance,
tumors have a diminished apoptotic response due to downregulation of BIM and PUMA. These results suggest
that the inability to induce apoptosis may limit the effectiveness of MEKi/PI3Ki for KRAS-mutant NSCLCs by
contributing to intrinsic and adaptive resistance to this therapy. Cancer Res; 74(11); 3146–56. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Advances in the understanding of genetic alterations in
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have given rise to therapies that target speciﬁc oncogenic signaling pathways. For
example, cancers that harbor activating EGF receptor (EGFR)
mutations or the EML4-ALK translocation are highly sensitive
to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and geﬁtinib or the ALK/MET
inhibitor crizotinib, respectively, with response rates of
approximately 60% to 70% (1–3). However, no highly effective
therapies have been developed for cancers harboring mutant
KRAS, which account for 20% to 25% of NSCLCs as well as a 35%
to 45% of colon cancers and 80% to 95% of pancreatic cancers.
Thus, there continues to be a great need for new therapeutic
strategies for KRAS-mutant cancers.

Activating mutations in KRAS lead to impaired GTPase
activity and constitutive activation of multiple signaling
pathways that regulate growth and survival, including
RAF/MEK/ERK, RalGDS, and in some instances, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (4). While attempts to directly
target the mutant KRAS protein have so far proven unsuccessful, an alternative approach is to target these downstream signaling pathways in combination. Several groups
have demonstrated that dual inhibition of MEK and PI3K
leads to tumor regression in experimental models of KRASmutant cancers (5–8). This has spurred the rapid clinical
development of this combination for KRAS-mutant cancers,
and although responses have been noted, the emerging data
have been underwhelming to date (9–12). Although the
tolerability of this combination when administered daily
remains questionable, it is also not clear what proportion
of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs are even truly sensitive to combined MEKi/PI3Ki, and the molecular features that underlie
sensitivity to this therapy have not been deﬁned.
In cancers driven by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as
EGFR and ALK, inhibition of the corresponding RTK leads to
suppression of the MEK and PI3K pathways, resulting in cellcycle arrest and apoptosis (13). Induction of apoptosis is
critical for tumor regressions in vivo, and a diminished apoptotic response contributes to intrinsic resistance to EGFR
inhibitors in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs (14, 15). These signaling
pathways modulate the BCL-2 family of pro- and antiapoptotic

Apoptotic Response of KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer to MEK/PI3K Inhibition

proteins that regulate the mitochondrial apoptotic response.
For instance, extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)mediated phosphorylation of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family
member BIM leads to its proteasomal degradation (16), and
suppression of ERK signaling results in increased BIM protein
levels, which is key for response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI; refs. 13, 17–19). Furthermore, in some instances, targeted
therapies may impact the expression of antiapoptotic mediators such as BCL-XL and MCL-1 by their effects on the NF-kB
and TORC1, respectively (13, 20). Thus, altering the balance of
pro- and antiapoptotic mediators by suppression of activated
kinase signaling pathways is a critical component of effective
targeted therapies.
In this study, we investigated the response of human KRASmutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki. Using a collection of human
KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines, we observed that the majority
had impaired responsiveness to MEKi/PI3Ki, resulting from
the differential ability of MEKi/PI3Ki to induce a robust
apoptotic response. Furthermore, loss of the apoptotic
response was associated with the development of resistance
to MEKi/PI3Ki in vitro and in vivo. These results provide insight
into the molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity and
resistance of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Human KRAS-mutant and EGFR-mutant NSLCLC cell lines
were obtained from the Center for Molecular Therapeutics at
the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center
(Boston, MA), which performs routine single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and short tandem repeat authentication (21);
cell lines were passaged for less than 6 months following
receipt. A427-R- and DV-90-R–resistant cell lines were generated by exposing parental cell lines to 1 mmol/L AZD6244/
GDC-0941 for 3 days followed by drug washout for 3 days. Cells
were treated for 5 to 10 cycles, followed by maintenance in the
continuous presence of drug. The N1, N2 (treatment-na€ve),
and R1, R2, R3 (AZD6244/BEZ235-resistant) lines are tumorderived cell lines from Kras p53L/L mice. For cell culture studies,
AZD6244 (Otava), GDC-0941 (Chemietek), ABT-263 (Active
Biochem), ABT-199 (Active Biochem), and NVP-BEZ235 (kindly provided by Novartis) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mmol/L and stored at
20 C. Antibodies utilized for Western blotting are listed in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell proliferation analysis
Cell lines were seeded 24 hours before addition of drug. Cells
were treated with drugs for 72 hours or as indicated and
proliferation determined by CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega).
For time course experiments, multiple identical plates were
seeded and at indicated time points were frozen at 80 C. All
plates were then developed at the end of the experiment
simultaneously.
Annexin/propidium iodide staining by ﬂow cytometry
Cells were seeded at low density 24 hours before drug
addition. After 72 hours, ﬂoating and adherent cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

collected and stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Cy5Annexin V and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Percentage of
apoptotic cells was calculated by subtracting percentage
of Annexin-positive cells in vehicle control from percentage
of Annexin-positive cells with drug treatment.
Short hairpin RNA screen
Bacterial pLKO shRNA clones (4–10 per gene) were obtained from the Molecular Phenotyping Laboratory at MGH.
Lentiviral stocks were produced according to the RNAi Consortium protocol from the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA).
Protein knockdown efﬁciency was determined by Western
blotting using A549 cells, and hairpins with the best knockdown were selected for use (Supplementary Table S2). Cell
lines were infected with lentivirus in an arrayed 96-well format at a multiplicity of infection of 2–3. After 24 hours, the
virus was removed and cells were cultured for 48 hours in normal media. Cells were then treated with 1 mmol/L AZD6244/
GDC-0941 for 48 hours, and cell viability and caspase-3/7
activity were determined by ApoTox-Glo assay (Promega).
Mouse treatment studies
All mouse studies were conducted through Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee–approved animal protocols in accordance with institutional guidelines. For xenograft studies, cell line suspensions were prepared in 1:10
Matrigel, and 5  106 cells were injected subcutaneously into
the ﬂanks of athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks). Visible tumors
developed in approximately 2 weeks. Tumors were measured
with electronic calipers, and the tumor volume was calculated according to the formula V ¼ 0.52  L  W2. Mice with
established tumors were randomized to drug treatment
groups: 25 mg/kg AZD6244 (0.5% methylcellulose/0.4% polysorbate), 100 mg/kg GDC-0941 (0.5% methylcellulose/0.2%
Tween-80), 100 mg/kg ABT-263 (30% PEG400/60% Phosal
50 PG/10% ethanol), or combinations. Drug treatments were
administered by oral gavage. Kras and Kras p53L/L mouse
strains harboring a conditional activating mutation (G12D)
at the endogenous Kras locus and conditional Trp53 knockout were described previously (22). Tumor burden was
quantiﬁed by serial MRI scanning as described (23).
MEKi/PI3Ki treatments included AZD6244 (25 mg/kg) once
daily combined with GDC-0941 (150 mg/kg), BEZ235 (50
mg/kg), or BKM120 (50 mg/kg) once daily. For pharmacodynamic studies, mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were
removed 3 hours after drug administration on day 3. Tumors
were divided and snap-frozen or formalin-ﬁxed.
Data and statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Software). Western blot band quantitation was
performed using SynGene Gene Tools Software. All correlation calculations were carried out using the Spearman
correlation test. Comparisons between groups (e.g., experimental vs. control) were made using paired or unpaired
t tests as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant and is indicated by asterisks unless
otherwise noted.

Results
KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines have highly variable
apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki
Our earlier studies suggested that the responses to MEKi/
PI3Ki in genetically engineered mouse Kras-mutant NSCLC
models can be variable, depending on the presence of concurrent secondary mutations (5, 24). For example, in these studies,
lung adenocarcinomas driven by mutant Kras in the absence of
accompanying mutations had dramatic regressions (75%
reduction in tumor burden) to combined treatment with the
MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (selumetinib) and the dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, whereas tumors with concurrent Lkb1 deletion had minimal responses (20% reduction in
tumor volume). We also examined the response of Kras-mutant
tumors with secondary Trp53 deletion (22) to treatment with
AZD6244/BEZ235 and observed a transient response of intermediate magnitude (60% reduction in tumor volume) that was
followed by rapid development of drug resistance after 4 weeks
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar responses were observed with
AZD6244 in combination with the pan-PI3K inhibitors GDC0941 or BKM120. These data indicate that the presence of
secondary mutations can diminish the response of KRASmutant NSCLCs to combined MEKi/PI3Ki therapy and suggest
that signiﬁcant heterogeneity of responsiveness may potentially exist among KRAS-mutant lung cancers in the clinic.
Human KRAS-mutant NSCLCs typically occur in the setting of
tobacco smoke exposure and exhibit a high mutational burden
(25). In contrast to the relative genetic simplicity of mouse
models, cell lines derived from human tumors harbor multiple
concurrent mutations or deletions in genes regulating growth
and survival pathways (Supplementary Table S1). To further
model the response of human KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/
PI3Ki, we assessed the effects of AZD6244 in combination with
GDC-0941 on cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis using a panel of 20 human KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines.
MEKi/PI3Ki induced G1 arrest and reduced cell proliferation by
50% to 90% in all cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Maximal inhibition of cell proliferation occurred with dual pathway inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3). Treatment with AZD6244 alone
increased AKT phosphorylation in several cell lines, underscoring
the potential beneﬁt of dual pathway inhibition to suppress
activation of feedback signaling loops. Of note, the concentration
of inhibitors chosen for use in subsequent studies was the lowest
concentration that achieved >90% pathway inhibition.
Unexpectedly, we observed that the apoptotic response to
MEKi/PI3Ki was highly variable despite the relatively uniform
inhibition of cell-cycle progression (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig.
S4A and S4B). Only a minority of cell lines exhibited a robust
apoptotic response similar to that of the EGFR-mutant HCC827
NSCLC cell line treated with the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib (13, 26).
Comparison of the effects of MEKi/PI3Ki on cell proliferation
between low- and high-apoptosis cell lines revealed that cell
lines with a minimal apoptotic response exhibited a net positive
proliferative response in the presence of MEKi/PI3Ki, albeit
reduced relative to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S3D). In contrast, cell lines with a high apoptotic response
had a net cytotoxic response to MEKi/PI3Ki, similar to HCC827

3148

cells treated with geﬁtinib. Inhibiting apoptosis with the pancaspase inhibitor QVD-Oph converted the cytotoxic response
of A427 cells to a net proliferative response (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S4C), demonstrating the important contribution
of apoptosis in addition to growth arrest for the in vitro effectiveness of MEKi/PI3Ki. Across the entire cell line panel, a
cytotoxic response to MEKi/PI3Ki coincided with a high degree
of both cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis and occurred only in a
minority of cell lines (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, TP53 or LKB1
mutational status did not correlate apoptotic responsiveness
to MEKi/PI3Ki (Supplementary Fig. S5), although it is worth
noting that the within each of these subgroups, cell lines harbored varied additional mutations (Supplementary Table S1).
To investigate the role of apoptosis in the response to MEKi/
PI3Ki in vivo, we established xenograft tumors in mice from
KRAS-mutant cell lines with high (A427) or low (SW1573)
apoptotic response. Before implantation, these cells were
modiﬁed to express Gaussia luciferase, which is secreted
into the blood allowing for precise quantitation of tumor cell
viability (ref. 27 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Combination
treatment of A427 xenografts with AZD6244/GDC-0941
resulted in decreased blood luciferase signal, indicating
decreased tumor cell viability as well as increased cleaved
caspase-3 immunostaining (Fig. 1E and F). In contrast, combination treatment of SW1573 xenografts failed to activate
caspase-3 and did not reduce blood luciferase signal despite
comparable inhibition of both p-ERK and p-AKT (Supplementary Fig. S7). Taken together, these results suggest that failure to
induce apoptosis may limit the efﬁcacy of combined MEK and
PI3K inhibition for KRAS-mutant NSCLCs in vitro and in vivo.
Variable apoptotic response is due to differential
activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
Tyrosine kinase signaling pathways modulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, which is regulated by the BCL-2
family proteins. MEKi/PI3Ki effectively suppressed the respective signaling pathways in cells with both high and low levels of
apoptosis (Supplementary Figs. S3C and S8A) but only resulted
in activation of BAX and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in
cells undergoing apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8C).
To further assess whether induction of apoptosis results
from variability in the downstream inhibition of MEK and PI3K
pathways, we examined transcriptional outputs following
MEKi/PI3Ki treatment. mRNA levels of the MEK/ERK pathway
targets DUSP6, SPRY4, and EGR-1 were dramatically reduced in
all cell lines, regardless of degree of apoptotic response (Supplementary Fig. S9). Similarly, mRNA levels of the FOXO3a
transcriptional targets HER3 and TRAIL were induced in lowand high-apoptosis cell lines, consistent with comparable
inhibition of PI3K/AKT. We also assessed whether differential
activation of another RAS effector pathway, RalGDS, which
has been shown to play a role in RAS-induced tumorigenesis
(28, 29), might contribute to the differential apoptotic
response. However, pull-down assays of GTP-bound RAL-A,
a small GTPase activated by RalGDS, revealed no clear differences in RAL-A activation in response to MEKi/PI3Ki between
high- and low-apoptosis cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S10). In
fact, a modest increase in GTP-bound RAL-A was observed

Apoptotic Response of KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer to MEK/PI3K Inhibition

Figure 1. Apoptosis is necessary for tumor regression in response to MEKi/PI3Ki in vitro and in vivo. A, cells were treated with 1 mmol/L AZD6244/GDC-0941 or
1 mmol/L geﬁtinib (HCC827), and the apoptotic response was determined by Annexin staining and ﬂow cytometry. Percentage of apoptotic cells were
determined by subtracting Annexin-positive cells with vehicle treatment. Data are mean and SE of 4 to 8 independent experiments. B, cells were treated with
1 mmol/L AZD6244/GDC-0941 or 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib (HCC827, closed squares) and cell proliferation determined by CellTiter-Glo viability assay. Data are
normalized to baseline value at the time of initial drug treatment (day 0) and are mean and SE of three independent experiments. C, cells were treated
with AZD6244/GDC-0941 with or without 20 mmol/L QVD-Oph. Data, mean and SE of triplicate samples. D, apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest are necessary for
cytotoxic response of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki. Each data point represents a different cell line. The response of the EGFR-mutant HCC827 cells
to geﬁtinib is shown for comparison. Data combined from A and B and Supplementary Fig. S2A. E, mice bearing SW1573-GLUC and A427-GLUC
subcutaneous xenografts were treated with 100 mg/kg GDC-0941 plus 25 mg/kg AZD6244 once daily by oral gavage and secreted luciferase in whole blood
was measured. Data, mean and SE (SW1573: control n ¼ 4, AZD/GDC n ¼ 4; A427: control n ¼ 4, AZD/GDC n ¼ 5). F, A427 but not SW1573 xenograft tumors
have increased caspase-3 activation following short-term MEKi/PI3Ki treatment.

following MEKi/PI3Ki in all three low-apoptosis cell lines and
two of three high-apoptosis cell lines, possibly due to suppression of negative feedback loops. In addition, there was no clear
difference in baseline RAL-A activation between low- and highapoptosis cell lines. This suggests that the differential apoptotic response induced by MEKi/PI3Ki is not simply explained
by variable inhibition of RAS effector pathways but may result
from differential ability of the MEK and PI3K pathways to
modulate the BCL-2 family of apoptotic regulatory proteins.
The apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki in KRAS-mutant
NSCLC cell lines does not correlate with baseline
mitochondrial apoptotic priming
Recently, the concept of mitochondrial priming has been
proposed to explain the relative sensitivity of cancers to

www.aacrjournals.org

chemotherapeutic agents (30). In this paradigm, priming is a
function of the proximity of a cell to the apoptotic threshold,
determined by the collective expression of pro- versus antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. The extent of priming can
be determined experimentally by BH3 proﬁling, which measures mitochondrial depolarization in response to exogenously added BH3 peptides that mimic the proapoptotic
activity of BH3-only proteins, including BIM, BID, and PUMA
(31, 32). To investigate whether the apoptotic response to
MEKi/PI3Ki among KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines is a
function of mitochondrial priming, we performed BH3 proﬁling on ﬁve high- and ﬁve low-apoptosis cells. However, no
correlation between baseline mitochondrial priming and
apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki was observed (Supplementary Fig. S11). This suggests that sensitivity of KRAS-

mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki may be more dependent on
dynamic changes in speciﬁc BCL-2 family proteins than
overall baseline proximity to the apoptotic threshold, in
contrast to what has been found for the less selective
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies (30).
PUMA, BIM, and BCL-XL mediate the apoptotic response
of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines to MEKi/PI3Ki
To determine the direct mediators of MEKi/PI3Ki-induced
apoptosis, we performed a targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
screen of the BCL-2 family and assessed the impact on MEKi/
PI3Ki-induced activation of caspase-3/7 in 5 high-apoptosis
KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines (A427, DV-90, H2009, H1792,
and A549). Each hairpin was veriﬁed to knockdown expression
of the target gene at the protein level (Supplementary Table
S2). In aggregate, knockdown of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins PUMA and BIM and the effector protein BAX led to
reduced caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 2A). To conﬁrm these
results, we established cell lines with stable knockdown of
BIM, PUMA and BAX and assessed the apoptotic response to

MEKi/PI3Ki. Conﬁrming the screen results, depletion of
PUMA, BIM, or BAX in A427 and A549 cells reduced caspase-3/7 activation in response to MEKi/PI3Ki compared with
shGFP-infected control cells (Fig. 2B) and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C). Similar protection from
apoptosis was observed after transfection with unrelated
siRNAs targeting BIM, PUMA, and BAX, reducing the likelihood
that this effect is due to nonspeciﬁc or off-target effects of
the hairpins (Supplementary Fig. S12). This indicates that BIM
and PUMA play a role in mediating the apoptotic response
to MEKi/PI3Ki in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells.
As shown above, MEKi/PI3Ki failed to induce substantial
apoptosis in many of the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. To
investigate whether antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins play
a role in mediating intrinsic resistance to MEKi/PI3Ki, we
performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of BCL-XL, MCL-1,
BCL-2, BCL-W, and BFL-1/A1 in 10 low-apoptosis KRASmutant NSCLC cell lines. Knockdown of BCL-XL and MCL-1
alone resulted in increased basal apoptosis and potentiated
the apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki (Fig. 2D). Notably,

Figure 2. PUMA, BIM, and BCL-XL mediate the apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki. A, ﬁve sensitive cells lines (A427, DV-90, H2009, H1792, A549) were infected

(Annexin-positive) were determined after treatment with 1 mmol/L AZD6244/GDC-0941. D, ten insensitive cell lines (H460, H2030, SW1573,
H1155, H358, H23, Calu-1, CORL-23, SK-LU-1, H1734, H1155) were infected with lentivirus harboring shRNAs targeting prosurvival BCL-2 family members
followed by treatment with 1 mmol/L AZD6244/GDC-0941. Each data point represents the mean relative caspase activation of an individual cell
line (two to ﬁve independent replicates) compared with shGFP vehicle control. E, cell lines were treated with 1 mmol/L AZD6244, GDC-0941, ABT263, or
combination. Each symbol represents the mean (three to four independent experiments) for a single cell line. F, cell lines were treated with 1 mmol/L AZD6244/

Apoptotic Response of KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer to MEK/PI3K Inhibition

knockdown of BCL-2 and other prosurvival BCl-2 family
members failed to do so. Because gene knockdown of BCLXL and MCL-1 led to substantially decreased viability and
complicated the selection of cell lines with stable knockdown,
we employed a pharmacologic strategy to conﬁrm the hypothesis that antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins such as BCL-XL
contribute to resistance to MEKi/PI3Ki. In the majority of cell
lines, the dual BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax)
stimulated a moderate degree of apoptosis, whereas a robust
apoptotic response was observed after MEKi/PI3Ki treatment in the presence of ABT-263 (Fig. 2E). Consistent with
the shRNA results, this effect of ABT-263 was speciﬁc to
inhibition of BCL-XL, as ABT-199, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor
(33), showed no effect (Supplementary Fig. S13). Given the
lack of a selective MCL-1 inhibitor, we were unable to
similarly test the effect of MCL-1 inhibition on sensitivity
to MEKi/PI3Ki. Nevertheless these results demonstrate that
prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins such as BCL-XL protect
some KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells from MEKi/PI3Ki-induced
apoptosis.
We next examined the effect of MEKi/PI3Ki on the expression of BCL-2 family proteins. Both PUMA and BIM protein
accumulated after MEKi/PI3Ki treatment in both low- and
high-apoptosis cells, whereas BCL-XL and MCL-1 levels were
largely unchanged in the majority of cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S14A). The absolute expression levels of any of these BCL-2
family members alone (BIM, PUMA, BCL-XL, or MCL-1) at
baseline or after drug treatment did not correlate with apoptotic sensitivity. However, because apoptosis is determined by
the relative balance of pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 family
proteins, we also analyzed the collective expression levels of
BIM and PUMA versus BCL-XL and MCL-1. Importantly, both
at baseline and after drug treatment, the expression of BIM and
PUMA protein levels relative to BCL-XL correlated highly with
apoptotic response (Fig. 2F), whereas accounting for the
expression of MCL-1 did not improve the correlation (Supplementary Fig. S14B).
We previously reported that baseline mRNA expression
levels of BIM could predict response to TKI treatment in
EGFR-mutant NSCLCs (14). Because the relative fold accumulation of BIM protein after TKI treatment is similar among
high- and low-apoptosis cancers, pretreatment BIM mRNA
levels effectively serve as a surrogate for on-treatment BIM
levels. In an analogous manner, we observed that the difference
in (BIM þ PUMA)/BCL-XL ratios between high- and lowapoptosis cells was similar whether measured at baseline or
after MEKi/PI3Ki treatment (2.3- and 2.2-fold, respectively;
Supplementary Fig. S14C). Therefore, we examined whether
pretreatment mRNA levels of BIM and PUMA versus BCL-XL
correlated with response to MEKi/PI3Ki. Across the entire
panel of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines, the pretreatment ratio
of BIM and PUMA relative to BCL-XL signiﬁcantly correlated
with apoptotic response to AZD644/GDC-0941 (Supplementary Fig. S14D). Taken together, these results indicate that the
apoptotic response of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki is
regulated by BIM, PUMA, and BCL-XL and suggest that differences in the relative expression of these proteins may underlie
differential apoptotic sensitivity.

Restoration of apoptotic response sensitizes KRASmutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki
To establish whether decreased expression of proapoptotic
relative to antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins underlies insensitivity
to MEKi/PI3Ki, we tested whether altering the balance of BIM
and BCL-XL reversed the resistance of KRAS-mutant NSCLC
cell lines to MEKi/PI3Ki. First, we inducibly expressed BIM
in low-apoptosis H2030 and SW1573 cells. Ectopic expression of BIM restored the apoptotic response to MEKi/PI3Ki
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S15) and resulted in a net
cytotoxic response (Fig. 3B). Second, we assessed the effects
of BCL-XL inhibition on cell proliferation. Treatment of cells
with ABT-263, which restores the apoptotic response to
MEKi/PI3Ki (Fig. 2E), likewise led to a cytotoxic response
in the majority of insensitive cell lines (Fig. 3C). In total,
restoration of apoptosis either by increased expression of
BIM or inhibition of BCL-XL correlated highly with conversion from a cytostatic to cytotoxic response to MEKi/PI3Ki
across the panel of insensitive cell lines (Fig. 3D). Finally, we
examined whether BCL-XL inhibition would translate to
improved efﬁcacy of MEKi/PI3Ki against insensitive KRASmutant NSCLCs in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro results,
addition of ABT-263 to MEKi/PI3Ki led to regression of
SW1573 xenograft tumors (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig.
S16). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the inability
for MEKi/PI3Ki to modulate BCL-2 family proteins sufﬁcient
to induce an apoptotic response contributes to intrinsic
resistance of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki in vitro
and in vivo.
Rapid adaptation of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/
PI3Ki involves loss of apoptotic response
The clinical efﬁcacy of targeted therapies is limited by the
emergence of drug resistance (34). When studying the response
of high-apoptosis KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines to MEKi/
PI3Ki, we observed that cells that survived the initial exposure
to drug were less sensitive on repeated drug exposure (Supplementary Fig. S17A). This suggests that even when cells are
initially sensitive to MEKi/PI3Ki, efﬁcacy might be limited by
rapid adaptation to drug. To investigate whether suppression
of apoptosis might underlie this adaptive response, we cultured A427 and DV-90 cells in the presence of AZD6244/GDC0941 for 3 days followed by drug washout for 3 days (Supplementary Fig. S17B). Although initial drug treatment caused a
robust apoptotic response, after 5 to 10 intermittent drug
treatments, the resulting resistant A427-R and DV-90-R cells
no longer exhibited a cytotoxic response and were able to
survive in the continuous presence of MEKi/PI3Ki (Fig. 4A).
MEKi/PI3Ki suppressed pERK, pAKT, and pS6 as well as cellcycle progression in both resistant and parental cells (Fig. 4B
and C; Supplementary Fig. S17C), indicating that resistance
was not due to reactivation of these signaling pathways. In
contrast, the resistant cells had a greatly diminished apoptotic
response to MEKi/PI3Ki (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S17D),
with decreased expression of BIM and PUMA (Fig. 4B). Thus,
loss of expression of proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins
leading to diminished apoptosis may underlie rapid adaptation
of KRAS-mutant NSCLC to MEKi/PI3Ki.

To investigate whether suppression of apoptosis might
contribute to rapid adaptation to MEKi/PI3Ki in vivo, we used
the Kras p53L/L lung adenocarcinoma model. These tumors
initially respond to MEKi/PI3Ki but quickly develop resistance
and progress after 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S1). We
generated cell lines from Kras p53L/L tumors (R1, R2, R3) after
progression on treatment with AZD6244/BEZ235, as well as
from treatment-na€ve Kras p53L/L tumors (N1, N2; Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. S18A and S18B). Cell lines from resistant
tumors maintained resistance to MEKi/PI3Ki in vitro, with loss
of the cytotoxic response exhibited by cell lines derived from
treatment-na€ve tumors (Fig. 5B). Importantly, resistant cell
lines exhibited a signiﬁcantly blunted apoptotic response to
treatment with AZD6244/GDC-0941 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary
Fig. S18C), despite undergoing cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S16D), similar to the differences observed between
sensitive KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines and those with intrinsic (Fig. 1) or acquired (Fig. 4) resistance.
We next examined whether differential expression of BCL-2
family proteins might be associated with resistance of Kras
p53L/L tumors to MEKi/PI3Ki in vivo. For reasons unclear to us,
analysis of BIM and PUMA protein expression from Kras p53L/L
tumors yielded variable and inconsistent results. Thus, we
investigated whether mRNA levels of BCL-2 family proteins
correlated with apoptotic responsiveness of cell lines derived

3152

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

from Kras p53L/L tumors, as we observed with the human KRAS
NSCLC cell lines described above. Compared with cells derived
from treatment-na€ve tumors, those derived from resistant
tumors exhibited signiﬁcantly decreased BIM mRNA expression, whereas PUMA and BCL-XL levels were similar (Fig. 5D;
Supplementary Fig. S19). Notably, the pretreatment ratio of
BIM relative to BCL-XL correlated with apoptotic response and
was diminished in cells from resistant tumors (Fig. 5E). Finally,
we examined whether pharmacologic inhibition of BCL-XL
with ABT-263 could resensitize resistant tumor cell lines to
MEKi/PI3Ki. Treatment of resistant Kras p53L/L cells with
AZD6244/GDC0941 in the presence of 100 nmol/L of ABT263 led to equivalent apoptosis as treatment-na€ve cells with
MEKi/PI3Ki alone (Fig. 5G). Altogether, these data indicate
that a diminished apoptotic response associated with loss of
expression of proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins may result in
rapid adaptation of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs to MEKi/PI3Ki in
vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
There is increasing evidence that differences in the apoptotic response among cancers with the same primary oncogenic
driver may result in variable clinical responses to targeted
therapies (14, 15). In this study, we ﬁnd that differences in the
apoptotic response contribute to variable in vitro and in vivo

responsiveness of KRAS-mutant NSCLC experimental models
to combined MEK and PI3K inhibition, a therapeutic combination currently being investigated in the clinic. Although
emerging data from clinical studies indicate signiﬁcant activity
in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancers and some lung cancers, the
activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC in general has been underwhelming (9, 12, 35). While clinical efﬁcacy may be limited
by issues related to dosing and toxicity, our data may explain
why the effectiveness of MEKi/PI3Ki may be limited, even
when full suppression of the signaling pathways can be
achieved. Because a large subset of KRAS-mutant lung
cancers may be relatively insensitive MEKi/PI3Ki even with
optimal inhibition, the ﬁndings in this study may become
even more salient as innovative therapeutic dosing strategies are developed.
The extent to which secondary mutations affect response
to targeted therapies is incompletely understood. Initial
studies demonstrating impressive activity of MEKi/PI3Ki
used genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS-mutant
NSCLCs with no additional mutations (5). Subsequent studies using tumors with concomitant deletion of Trp53 or Lkb1
have shown less impressive responses of these mouse models to targeted therapies, including MEKi/PI3Ki (23, 24).
However, there remain limited data on the impact of sec-

ondary mutations on clinical response to targeted therapies
in patients. This may be especially relevant to KRAS-mutant
lung cancers, which are associated with a history of cigarette
smoking and exhibit increased mutational burden (25). In
this study, we modeled the heterogeneity of human NSCLCs
by employing a large panel of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines
that harbor numerous and diverse secondary mutations in
key growth and survival pathways (Supplementary Table S1).
Using these models, MEKi/PI3Ki demonstrated much less
impressive activity than the original mouse studies with Kras
mutations alone, more akin to what is being observed in the
clinic. Despite induction of cell-cycle arrest across the panel
of cell lines, MEKi/PI3Ki was largely ineffective at provoking
sufﬁcient apoptosis to cause a cytotoxic response in the
majority of cell lines. In contrast to the genetically engineered mouse models, we did not observe statistically
signiﬁcant correlations between apoptotic response and
TP53 or LKB1 mutational status. The reasons for this are
unclear; however, it is possible that additional mutations
present in the cell lines modify the responses to MEKi/PI3Ki.
It is worth noting that all but one (A427) LKB1-mutant cell
line exhibited low levels of apoptosis, consistent with the
lack of response to MEKi/PI3Ki observed in the Kras Lkb1
mice (24). However, these studies point to the potential

limitation of genetically engineered mouse models for predicting response to novel therapeutic combinations.
While our study adds to the growing evidence for the
importance of the apoptotic response for effective targeted
therapies, it also suggests that loss of the apoptotic response
secondary to downregulation of proapoptotic mediators
may contribute to adaptive or acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This may be especially relevant to therapies
that inhibit downstream effector signaling pathways such as
MEK and PI3K rather than an RTK (e.g., mutant EGFR)
because resistance to RTK inhibitors can be achieved by
mutations in the receptor (e.g., EGFR T790M) or activation
of alternate pathways (i.e., bypass tracks) that lead to reactivation of downstream signaling nodes such as MEK and
PI3K (26, 36, 37). In contrast, KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines
with acquired resistance to MEKi/PI3Ki still exhibited suppression of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling and cell-cycle
arrest upon drug treatment but this failed to translate into
an apoptotic response. Thus, strategies to overcome either
intrinsic or adaptive resistance may need to focus speciﬁ-

3154

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

cally on restoration of the apoptotic response such as use of
epigenetic regulators to increase transcription of proapoptotic proteins or direct targeting of antiapoptotic BCL-2
family members (15, 38). As proof of concept, we demonstrate that restoration of BIM expression or use of ABT-263
can resensitize resistant KRAS-mutant human and mouse
cancer cells, respectively, to MEKi/PI3Ki.
In summary, we feel that this study has important implications for the use of combined MEK and PI3K inhibitors
and other targeted therapies for the treatment of KRASmutant NSCLCs. While MEKi/PI3Ki may be effective for
some KRAS-mutant cancers, it is unlikely to be universally
effective given the heterogeneity observed among human
KRAS-mutant lung cancers. Future investigations of novel
therapies for KRAS-mutant NSCLC should account for this
heterogeneity to maximize potential for clinical success. In
addition, the development of biomarkers beyond the primary oncogenic driver will likely be crucial for predicting
which patients will respond to speciﬁc therapies. For example, apoptotic biomarkers combined with standard

genotyping may be useful in predicting response to targeted
therapies (14). Finally, given the importance of the apoptotic
response, combination therapies that directly target BCL-2
family proteins may be a useful component of therapeutic
strategies for KRAS-mutant cancers (39).
