ABSTRACT
Objective: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and thalidomide
have been used for treating primary hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). This study aims
to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of thalidomide and TACE in primary HCC.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) about efficacy and safety of
thalidomide combined with TACE for primary HCC were identified from the Cochrane
Library, Pubmed, Embase, CNKI, and Wan Fang until August, 2016. The retrieved
trials were reviewed and the data were extracted by two reviewers, independently.
Combined analyses of survival rates, overall response rate(ORR), disease control
rate(DCR), changes of KPS, parameters of cellular immunity and vascular endothelial
growth factor(VEGF), and adverse events were performed using RevMan 5.3 software.
Results: A total of 23 RCTs involving 1836 patients were included. The results
showed that thalidomide plus TACE was significantly superior in increasing 6-month
survival rate(OR=1.79, 95% CI:1.02-3.15, P=0.04), 1-year survival rate(OR=1.76,
95% CI:1.38-2.24, P<0.0001), 1.5-year survival rate(OR=4.72, 95% CI:2.64-8.43,
P<0.001), 2-year survival rate(OR=1.78, 95% CI:1.37-2.30, P<0.001), ORR(OR=1.89,
95% CI:1.48-2.42, P<0.0001), DCR(OR=2.62, 95% CI:1.90-3.63, P<0.001),
improvement in cellular immunity(MD=0.63, 95% CI:0.45-0.80, P<0.0001), and
reduction of VEGF(MD=-119.71, 95% CI:-135.75—103.68, P<0.0001), when compared
with TACE group. The incidences of gastrointestinal reactions, myelosuppression, and
liver dysfunction were similar between combination group and TACE group(P>0.05).
However, compared to TACE, the combination of thalidomide and TACE had a higher
incidence of drug rash(OR=6.35, 95% CI:2.75-14.68, P<0.0001).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that thalidomide combined with TACE shows
better clinical efficacy and tolerable adverse events in patients with primary HCC
when compared with TACE alone.

INTRODUCTION

for HCC includes hepatectomy, liver transplantation, local
ablative therapy, chemotherapy and molecular targeted
therapies [2]. The hepatectomy and liver transplantation
are considered to be the curative therapies, however,
HCC is usually diagnosed at advanced stage when the
application of curative treatments seems to be of little
value [3, 4]. For intermediate HCC identified by the
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system,

Hepatocelluar carcinoma(HCC) is a primary
malignant disease derived from liver cells. HCC is one
of the most common digestive cancers worldwide and the
third most common cause of cancer related death in the
Asia-Pacific region [1]. In China, HCC is the second most
common cancer after lung cancer. The treatments options

the local-regional therapies including trans-catheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency
ablation (RFA), and percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEI) are suggested as the optimal treatments [5, 6].
These methods have been shown to prolong survival and
treatment response for patients, particularly TACE [7-9].
TACE delivers chemotherapeutic agents to
the cancer location while blocking the blood supply
supporting the growth of tumor [10]. However, the
3-year survival rate is only about 20% due to the complex
recurrence mechanisms of HCC. One of them is believed
to be angiogenesis caused by vascular endothelial growth
factor(VEGF) [11]. It is reported that the elevated levels
of VEGF and other angiogenic factors secreted by the
hypoxic tumor cells after TACE has the role of promoting
abnormal angiogenesis [11]. Indeed, by targeting VEGF,
platelet derived growth factor receptor, and other
signaling, anti-angiogenesis agents proved to block tumor
development and neo-angiogenesis [12, 13].
In recent years, several molecular targeted agents
inhibiting the process of angiogenesis have been
introduced into clinical practice and show effective
results [14]. Thalidomide is not only capable of inhibiting
angiogenesis, but also modulating immunity [15, 16].
Thalidomide alone or in combination with other regimen
has been widely used in treating cancers such as multiple
myeloma [17, 18], HCC [4, 19], lung cancer [20], and
bladder cancer [21]. With regards to HCC, many clinical
retrospective studies or RCTs [3, 19, 22-29] evaluated
the effect of adding thalidomide to TACE on patients
with primary HCC, and the results of most of these
studies are positive. Patients treated with thalidomide
and TACE have a better clinical response and survival
than TACE alone. However, these evidences are lack of
powerful convincing as the samples of these studies are
relatively small. Besides, whether the use of thalidomide
in combination with TACE has a better clinical efficacy in
patients with intermediate or advanced HCC, there is no
final conclusion.
With the concern mentioned above, we
systematically identified clinical studies on the topic of
thalidomide with TACE for treating HCC, extracted data
and conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of thalidomide when combined with TACE,
aimed to provide evidence for supporting administration
of thalidomide in HCC patients treated with TACE.

after reviewing the title and abstract. The full-text of the
left 38 studies were further reviewed and 15 of them were
excluded. Finally, 23 clinical studies [30-52] including
1836 patients with primary HCC were included. There
were 904 cases in the thalidomide combined with TACE
group and 932 cases in the TACE group. The overall
process of study selection is presented in Figure 1.
The baseline characteristics of included studies are
listed in Table 1. Most of the eligible studies did not report
the method of blinding. All of the studies were on the topic
of efficacy and safety of thalidomide combined with TACE
versus TACE alone in intermediate or advanced primary
HCC patients. The age and sex distribution were similar in
both groups. All of the included trials were performed in
China. The dose of thalidomide and cycle of TACE were
in accordance within these studies. The regimen of TACE
were similar between different studies. The studies of Yunxiao Lin, et al. [36, 40] and Chang-nan Chen, et al. [36]
reported more cases than other studies. All of the included
studies reported the therapeutic effects of thalidomide
according to the mRECIST criteria. The ORR and DCR
were defined as (cases of CR plus PR)/total cases and
(cases of CR, PR, and SD)/total cases, respectively. All
of the studies reported ethics and written consent during
treatments. The concentrations of VEGF and AFP were
reported to be tested by Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent
assay(ELISA) test in included studies. The parameters
of cellular immunity were tested by flow cytometry and
analyzed by CellQuest in included studies.

Results of quality evaluation
The overall quality of included studies was evaluated
according to criteria for bias risk assessment in the
Cochrane collaboration handbook 5.1.4. All of the eligible
trials reported the application of randomization. Among
these studies, four [32, 33, 44, 46] of them mentioned
about the method of randomized number table, one [47]
mentioned the use of envelop method, and the rest of them
did not report detailed method of randomization. All of
the studies did not report whether the treatment regimen
was allocated or not. Only two studies [38, 39] used
blinding method in the process of treatments. All of the
studies presented the data about baseline characteristics
and endpoints of participants and they were regarded as
reporting complete data. Other sources of bias were not
evaluable as all of the studies did not provide enough
bias related data. The detailed information about quality
assessment in each study is presented in Table 2.

Overall response rate

42-45, 47, 50, 51], and 3 [34, 45, 51] studies reported data
of survival rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2 and 3, there were no significant
heterogeneity in most of the combined analyses in terms
of survival rates, and the fixed effect model was used,
except the 36 months survival. The results of metaanalyses revealed that compared to TACE alone, primary
HCC patients treated with thalidomide and TACE could
gain significantly superior in increasing 6-month survival
rate(OR=1.79, 95% CI:1.02-3.15, P=0.04), 1-year survival
rate(OR=1.76, 95% CI:1.38-2.24, P<0.0001), 1.5-year
survival rate(OR=4.72, 95% CI:2.64-8.43, P<0.001),
and 2-year survival rate(OR=1.78, 95% CI:1.37-2.30,
P<0.001), respectively. However, there was no significant
difference between combination group and TACE alone
group in 3-year survival rate(OR=1.54, 95% CI:0.70-3.41,
P=0.09 ).

Of the 23 included studies, 15 [34-37, 39, 41, 42,
44-47, 49-51] of them reported the ORR in primary HCC
patients receiving thalidomide and TACE versus TACE
alone. After inputting effective numbers and total cases in
RevMan 5.3 software, the combined results showed that
there was a low risk of heterogeneity as indicated by the I2
value=0%, and the fixed model was used to calculate the
Odds Ratio(OR). As illustrated by Figure 4, there were
350(63.9%) cases gained significantly improvements in
ORR in patients treated with thalidomide and TACE, when
compared to 281 cases(49.0%) in TACE group(OR=1.89,
95%CI: 1.48-2.42; P<0.01). This finding indicated that
thalidomide combined with TACE had a better efficacy
than TACE alone in primary HCC patients. The sensitivity

analyses showed that the final effect of combination
regimen was reliable.
We introduced sub-group analysis to evaluate the
clinical efficacy of thalidomide combined with different
regimen of TACE. Included studies were divided into
3 groups(oxaliplatin based regimen, 5-Fu+DDP based
regimen, and 5-Fu+ADM\EPI based regimen), according
to the agents used in the TACE process. By using
fixed effect model, the combined results showed that
thalidomide plus oxaliplatin based regimen had a higher
OR(OR=2.88, 95%CI: 1.34-6.19; P=0.007 ), followed by
5-Fu+DDP based regimen(OR=1.90, 95%CI: 1.31-2.76;
P<0.001) and 5-Fu+ADM\EPI based regimen (OR=1.87,
95%CI: 1.21-2.88; P=0.005).

regards to regimen of thalidomide combined with TACE
versus TACE alone in patients with primary HCC. As
indicated by the I2%=0%, it was considered that there was
no significant heterogeneity across included studies, and
the fixed model was applied. As illustrated in Figure 5, the
combined data showed that the DCR in thalidomide plus
TACE group was significantly better than that in the TACE
group(83.5% vs. 67.2%; OR=2.62, 95%CI: 1.90-3.63;
P<0.01), suggesting that patients treated with thalidomide
plus TACE may have a better DCR than TACE alone.

Quality of life
Only 1 of the included studies reported data about
quality of life in terms of KPS scores. However, the metaanalysis was not performed as there was insufficient
data and significant heterogeneity in the selected study.
As shown by the study of Wei-sheng Zheng, et al., [30]
compared to TACE treatment, a significant improvement

Disease control rate
There were 13 studies [34-37, 39, 41, 42, 44-47,
49, 50] reported data of disease control rate(DCR) with

Changes of VEGF and AFP

Parameters of cellular immunity

With regards to VEGF, 7 [33, 37, 42, 43, 46, 49, 54]
of 23 RCTs provided data of changes of VEGF in patients
treated with thalidomide and TACE. There was moderate
heterogeneity(I2=43%) between these selected studies, so
the fixed effect model was introduced. As shown in Figure
7, the levels of VEGF were significantly lower in patients
treated with thalidomide and TACE when compared to
TACE alone(MD=-119.71, 95% CI:-135.75--103.68;
p<0.01), suggesting that thalidomide may have role of
decreasing the level of VEGF when combined with TACE.
Six studies [34, 37, 41, 42, 46, 49] provided data
about changes of AFP level or numbers of AFP reduction
in patients receiving thalidomide combined with TACE
versus TACE. For AFP levels, the analysis of heterogeneity
showed that there was low risk of heterogeneity across
selected studies(I2%=41%), and the fixed effect model
was used. As presented in Figure 7, the combined mean

Only 3[37, 48, 52] of the included studies reported
data about parameters of cellular immunity including
CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, and NK. The results of
meta-analysis revealed that significant heterogeneity was
observed within these two trials(I2%>50%) on CD3+ and
CD8+, and the random effect model was used to synthesize
the data. As shown in Figure 6, compared to TACE
treatment, significant improvements in CD4+(MD=9.54,
95%CI: 7.43-11.65; P<0.01), CD4+/CD8+(MD=0.63,
95%CI: 0.45-0.80; P<0.01), and NK(MD=9.74,

receiving thalidomide plus TACE treatment, showing
that thalidomide plus TACE may have a better effect in
improving the quality of life in patients with primary
HCC when compared with TACE treatment. However,

difference was -74.76(95%CI:-90.25, -59.28; p<0.001).
This suggested that thalidomide in combination with
TACE had a better effect on reducing concentration of
AFP in serum than TACE alone. For numbers of AFP
reduction, three studies reported data of decrease rates of
AFP level in patients with primary HCC receiving TACE
plus thalidomide. As the I2%=0%, it was considered that
there was no significant heterogeneity across included
studies, and the fixed effect model was applied during
the process of analysis. As shown in Figure 7, the cases
with decreased AFP was 56 in combination group, and
it was 42 cases in TACE alone group(55.4% vs. 35.9%;

performed based on the fixed effect model as there was no
significant heterogeneity(I2%<10%). The results showed
that the incidences of myelo-suppression were similar
between thalidomide plus TACE group and TACE alone,
and there was no significantly difference (OR=1.21,
95%CI:0.69-2.12; P=0.51). Non-hematological toxicities
were mainly exhibited as drug rash, liver dysfunction,
and gastrointestinal reactions. Three studies [39, 42,
44] provided events of drug rash and the detection of
heterogeneity demonstrated negative finding (I2%=0%).
The results of meta-analysis based on the fixed effect
model revealed that there was significant difference in the
incidence of drug rash in thalidomide plus TACE group
when compared with TACE, indicating that the incidence
of drug rash was higher in the combination group than
that in the TACE alone group (OR=6.35, 95%CI: 2.7514.68; P<0.01). Four studies [34, 39, 42, 44] reported
the occurrence of gastrointestinal reactions. We used
fixed effect model to calculate the combined result of
gastrointestinal reactions, and the results showed that
there was no statistically significant difference between
thalidomide in combination with TACE group and TACE

Adverse events

DISCUSSION

The use of thalidomide has been proved to be
beneficial in treating and delaying progression of
several diseases, including HCC, multiple myeloma,
and lung cancer. Several meta-analyses have evaluated
the effectiveness of thalidomide in managements of
multiple myeloma [17, 18, 55-61] and lung cancer [20].
These studies demonstrated that thalidomide maintenance
therapy improved survival and disease control rates,
which is in accordance with our main findings. The
possible molecular mechanisms of thalidomide mainly
includes anti-angiogenesis, inhibition of cytokines,
such as TNF-á (tumor necrosis factor-á), bFGF (basic
fibroblast growth factor) and VEGF(vascular endothelial
growth factor) and modification of the expression of cell
adhesion molecules [4, 17, 62]. The improvement in
efficacy by adding thalidomide to TACE may be due to
the anti-angiogenesis effect of thalidomide, as the VEGF
level usually elevates after TACE [19, 37]. Compared
with other anti-angiogenesis agents, especially sorafenib,
thalidomide has been shown to be economical and
practical benefits when combined with TACE and shows

Thalidomide has been widely used in clinical
practice for treating several cancers including primary
HCC. Several clinical trials suggested that thalidomide
combined with TACE could significantly improve the
clinical response rate, disease control rate, quality of
life and survival rate in primary HCC, with tolerable
adverse events. In this study, we systematically searched
clinical studies on the topic of thalidomide combined
with TACE versus TACE alone in patients with primary
HCC, and used the synthesized data to determine the
effect of thalidomide in improving the clinical efficacy of
TACE. The combined results showed that thalidomide in
combination with TACE had better ORR, DCR, quality
of life and survival rates, and the decreases of AFP and
VEGF were also significant, when compared with TACE
alone. With regards to safety profile, administration of
thalidomide significantly increased the incidence of drug
rash, but not adverse events of gastrointestinal, myelosuppression, and liver dysfunction.

tolerable adverse events in primary HCC patients. Three
meta-analyses [63-65] evaluated the effectiveness and
safety of TACE plus sorafenib versus TACE alone for
patients with unresectable HCC. The study of Liu et al.
[63] reported that the DCR ranged from 18.4 to 91.2%
in 10 noncomparative studies. Adding sorafenib to TACE
may bring benefits for unresectable HCC in terms of TTP
but not OS. In the study of Yang et al. [65], their metaanalysis of 6 studies including 1181 patients showed
that the combination group of sorafenib and TACE had
longer overall survival(HR=0.64, p<0.05) and TTP, and
better response to treatment(RR=1.45, p<0.05) than TACE
group. Fu et al. [64] also reported a similar conclusion
that combination of sorafenib and TACE had survival and
clinical benefits in patients with HCC, but associated with
enhanced morbidity. In our included studies, the DCR
ranged from 69 to 95%. The ORR data of these studies
were available, and the combined data showed that
application of thalidomide with TACE improved ORR
in primary HCC patients. The DCR data from included

studies were available, and the results showed a benefit
of thalidomide for the improvement of DCR with nonsignificant heterogeneity. The combined benefits of using
thalidomide in association with TACE in improving
overall survival, progression free survival, and/or time
to progression could not be calculated as relevant data
was not provided by the included studies. However, by
extracting data of survival rates at different follow-up,
the synthesized results determined that thalidomide plus
TACE had superior efficacy at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months,
when compared with TACE alone. Indeed, several clinical
trials[19, 66] and experimental studies [4, 24] also confirm
the anti-tumor effects of thalidomide in HCC, and the
results are encouraging.
As thalidomide shows effective outcomes in treating
moderate and advanced HCC, whether tumor associated
biomarker and angiogenesis related biomarker have roles
in predicting its efficacy are being investigated [4, 25,
67]. In our meta-analysis, the changes of AFP and VEGF
were reported by several included studies. Thalidomide

with TACE reduced the serum level of AFP by a mean
value of 141.95, better than TACE alone. Chen et al., [67]
conducted a study to evaluate the clinical implications
of AFP response in advanced HCC with thalidomide
treatment. They included 42 patients for the final analysis,
and defined AFP response as a 50% or greater reduction
of AFP levels for 4 or more weeks during treatment.
Radiographic response was determined by World Health
Organization(WHO) criteria. The results showed that
AFP response was obtained in 24% of patients, and it was
independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. They
concluded that AFP response after thalidomide therapy can
more accurately reflect the biological response in HCC
than radiographic response [67]. Another study conducted
by Shao et al. [25], got a similar conclusion that early
AFP response is a useful surrogate marker for predicting
efficacy and prognosis in advanced HCC patients receiving
thalidomide or sorafenib. With regard to VEGF, it has
been proved to be a powerful pro-angiogenesis factor in

several cancers including HCC [4, 68, 69]. In recent years,
VEGF is also known as a prognostic biomarker in HCC
patients treated with TACE or molecular targeted therapies
[11, 70, 71]. In these studies, the level of VEGF before
treatment is often used to predict clinical efficacy but not
the changes of VEGF between prior- and post- treatments.
Our results found that the mean level of VEGF was
decreased by 123.64 in thalidomide plus TACE group than
TACE group. These findings suggested that thalidomide
could reduce the levels of AFP and VEGF, however, we
could not determine whether the improved ORR, DCR and
survival rates were associated with changed levels of AFP
and VEGF. This needs well designed clinical trials and
experimental studies to assess the relationship between
changes of AFP and VEGF and prognosis and efficacy of
thalidomide.
The quality of life in advanced HCC is always
impaired and it gets worse when adverse events are
emerged after treatments. How to enhance the anti-tumor

effect of TACE without significantly affecting the quality
of life and increasing the incidences of adverse events
is extremely important. The pooled results showed that
thalidomide treatment significantly improved quality of
life in patients with HCC with tolerable safety events.
Therefore, these points mentioned above may support the
wide use of thalidomide in combination with TACE to
obtain positive outcomes in terms of ORR, DCR, survival
rates, quality of life and safety.
There were several limitations within this study.
First, although all of the included studies were RCTs,
differences in baseline characteristics, study design and
clinical parameters of included patients were existed.
For example, the ages, regions, performance status, and
numbers of participants differed in included articles.
Few studies reported detailed methods of randomization,
and most of the studies did not report the method of
blinding. The selective report bias may exist within the
eligible studies, increasing the risk of publication bias.
The different duration and doses of thalidomide treatment
could increase the risk of heterogeneity, affecting the
overall findings. Second, nearly all of the included
studies were conducted in China, and they were small
sample RCTs with limited number of participants. This
could result in regional findings applicable for certain
populations, decreasing the reliance of our results in
clinical practice abroad. Even though, this meta-analysis
was reliable and high quality as all of the selected studies
were RCTs with relatively low risk of heterogeneity, and

the results of this study could be used for guiding clinical
treatment, especially for patients in China.

CONCLUSION
In summary, thalidomide with TACE was associated
with a significant improvement in the response rate and
better survival rates in primary HCC patients. These
results were especially noteworthy for patients without
consideration of surgical resection or transplantation in
China. The therapeutic effects of thalidomide observed in
this meta-analysis may be due to the reduction in serum
AFP and VEGF levels. Our study provided new evidence
for treatment of moderate or advanced HCC. Welldesigned, large sample, multi-center, RCTs were required
to support our findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

were classified as randomization, allocation concealment,
blinding, incomplete data, selective data reporting and
other potential sources of bias. The overall quality of
included was defined as low, moderate, and high. Based
on these standards, two reviewers independently assessed
the bias of each eligible RCT. The inconsistent opinion on
some RCT was solved by discussion or a third reviewer.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows:
(1) Study type: RCTs reporting clinical efficacy and
safety of thalidomide combined with TACE versus TACE
alone in treating patients with primary HCC, either in
Chinese or English, regardless of blinding or allocation
concealment; (2) Study subjects: patients were diagnosed
as primary HCC with adequate evidence(histological
diagnosis, imaging of liver enhanced MRI and/or CT )
[8, 72], unsuitable for surgery, and Karnofsky score
> 60, without limitation of sex, age, and race; (3)
Interventions: thalidomide in combination with TACE
versus TACE, thalidomide in combination with TACE
and other treatments versus TACE and other treatments.
The procedure and regimen for TACE were completely
identical for both groups receiving TACE; (4)Endpoints:
adequate and standard definition of primary endpoints
included overall response rate(ORR), complete
response(CR), partial response(PR), stable disease(SD)
and progression disease(PD); adequate and standard
definition of secondary endpoints were disease control
rate(DCR), KPS score, survival rates at different times,
changes of AFP and VEGF, and incidence of adverse
events.
The exclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were
as follows: (1) Study type: no clinical trials, no RCTs,
retrospective studies; (2) duplicate publication; (3) unreasonable design of methodology; (4) one-arm trial,
case report, clinical experience, or review; (5) patients
with poor performance status or unsuitable for TACE; (6)
secondary or metastatic liver cancer; (7) no clear standards
of diagnosis; (8) full-text without reporting required data.

Data extraction
The baseline data of each eligible study was
extracted by two reviewers based on the previously
prepared data extraction table. Data needed to be recorded
was as follows: (1) general information such as title,
first author, publication year, and source; (2) data about
participants such as sex, age, diagnosis criteria, numbers
of cases for each group, and lost to follow-up; (3) data
about study design and performance such as trial type,
duration of study and follow-up, interventions for different
groups and measurements; (4) data of outcomes, including
efficacy, survival rate, changes of KPS and VEGF,
incidence of adverse events. To obtain essential data,
contact with corresponding authors if necessity.

Statistically analysis
All of the meta-analysis was performed using the
RevMan 5.3 software. The methods used for statistically
analysis were similar with previously published metaanalyses. Briefly, the heterogeneity between the included
studies was analyzed by χ2 test. When the results of
included studies were statistically homogeneous (P>0.1,
I2<50%), the fixed effect model was used for metaanalysis. Otherwise, the random effect model was used
for meta-analysis if the results of included studies were
statistical heterogeneity (P <0.1, I2>50%). We also
evaluated the possible factors that may contribute to
heterogeneity, and subgroup analysis was performed based
on these factors. In case of low-quality studies in metaanalysis, sensitivity analysis was used to test the stability
and strength of the combined results. For dichotomous
data, the pooled odd ratio(OR) were calculated with the
95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, the
weighted mean differences(WMD) or Odds Ratio(OR)
and their associated 95%CIs were calculated for every
trial involved in the meta-analysis. We defined there was
a statistically significant difference between combination
group and TACE group if the p<0.05. The funnel plot
was applied to detect possible publication bias, with the
definition of p<0.1 as existing significant publication bias.

Study selection
The selection of RCTs was completed by two
reviewers, independently. First, the title and abstract of
identified studies were reviewed and those did not meet
the inclusion criteria were excluded; Next, to identify
remaining studies, the full-texts of possibly eligible studies
were checked. If there was disagreement to anyone of
possible included studies, a third reviewer was involved
to decide include or not.
