ABSTRACT
CXCR1 and CXCR2 together with cognate chemokines are significantly upregulated
in a number of cancers, where they act as key regulators of tumor cell proliferation,
metastasis, and angiogenesis. We have previously reported a mutant protein of
CXCL8/Interleukin-8, CXCL8(3–72)K11R/G31P (G31P), which can act as a selective
antagonist towards CXCR1/2 with therapeutic efficacy in both inflammatory diseases
and malignancies. In this study, we investigated the effect of this ELR-CXC chemokine
antagonist G31P on human non-small cell lung cancer cells and lung tumor progression
in an orthotopic xenograft model. We report increased mRNA levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2
in human lung cancer tissues compared to normal counterparts. Expression levels of
CXCR1/2 cognate ligands was determined by ELISA. CXCR1/2 receptor antagonism via
G31P leads to decreased H460 and A549 cell proliferation and migration in a dosedependent manner. G31P also enhanced apoptosis in lung cancer cells as determined by
elevated levels of cleaved PARP, Caspase-8, and Bax, together with a reduced expression
of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In an in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model
of human lung cancer, G31P treatment suppressed tumor growth, metastasis, and
angiogenesis. At the molecular level, G31P treatment was correlated with decreased
expression of VEGF and NFкB-p65, in addition to reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and AKT. Our results suggest that G31P blockage of CXCR1 and CXCR2 can inhibit human
lung cancer cell growth and metastasis, which offers potential therapeutic opportunities.

therapeutics options. Inspiringly, recent targeted therapy
approaches against Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) and Anaplastic Lymphoma Receptor Tyrosine
Kinase (ALK) have shown promising results and been
approved for clinical use. Nevertheless, this group only
accounts for a small proportion of lung cancer, and the
remaining majority still lacks a druggable target till now.
It is widely accepted that inflammation is closely
implicated in cancer development and progression.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the world.
The mortality rate due to lung cancer has increased over
the past 3 decades, surpassing liver cancer as the leading
cause of death due to malignant tumors in China [1, 2].
Globally, lung cancers are the leading cancer of both
males and females [3]. The majority of patients diagnosed
with lung cancer has incurable advanced disease with few

Chemokines are secreted proteins that regulate cell
behavior via their cognate G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs), with four families of chemokines coordinating
tissue inflammation by recruiting and activating leuko­
cytes [4]. Constitutive expression of proinflammatory
chemokines is already described in many cancer types,
which supports tumor growth through direct stimulation
of cancer cells or establishment of supportive tumor
stroma, in addition to facilitate cancer cell invasion [5, 6].
Lung cancer malignancies are often linked to abnormal
expression or activation of an array of growth factors,
cytokines, ELR-CXC chemokines, and their receptors,
which cumulatively activate signaling pathways that foster
tumor growth [7, 8].
The CXCR1 and CXCR2 GPCRs are important
therapeutic targets in many solid tumors, including lung,
breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers, hepatocellular
carcinoma and melanoma [9–12]. Evidences suggest that
CXCR2 may participate directly in tumor progression
[13]. For example, melanoma tumor progression and lung
metastasis are significantly inhibited in CXCR2-deficient
mice compared to wild type mice [14]. Furthermore, it
has also been shown in a murine model that depletion of
CXCR2 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis of lung
cancer [15]. The seven sibling ELR-CXC chemokines
(i.e. CXCL1–3 & 5–8) can bind and activate either CXCR1
or CXCR2 receptor [16]. Previous studies have confirmed
that these chemokines can drive tumor growth in the
absence of other inflammatory changes, but also foster the
development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy [16].
CXCL8, for example, is an effective and potent angiogenic
factor [17]. Many non-small cell lung cancer cell lines
produce CXCL8, the expression of which is related to
angiogenesis, metastasis, and poor survival rates in many
studies. Thus, targeting the mitogenic and angiogenic
activities of these chemokines will help to control tumor
invasion and metastasis of human lung cancers [18–20].
These data suggest that CXCR1/2 antagonists that bind
with high affinity to these receptors and block downstream
signaling pathways can be used for greater therapeutic
responsiveness and efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers.
We have previously reported a CXCL8/Interleukin-8
analogue, CXCL8(3–72)K11R/G31P (or briefly G31P), which
contains Arg and Pro substitutions for Lys11 and Gly31
respectively of human CXCL8(3–72). G31P is a selective
CXCR1 and CXCR2 antagonist, which has shown high
efficacy in the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases
[21–23]. Moreover, we also explored the potential effects of
G31P during tumorigenesis. G31P treatment inhibits human
prostate cancer growth and metastasis in a mouse model by
decreasing tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis [24].
More recently, our further study also proved effectiveness
of G31P in promoting apoptosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells [25]. On the basis of above information,
we hypothesized that inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2
by G31P might attenuate tumorigenesis of lung cancer. We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

evaluated the potency of G31P as a therapeutic approach
in non-small cell lung cancer, investigating its impact on
tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.
We also elucidate the molecular mechanism by which
CXCR1/2 antagonism with G31P inhibits downstream
signaling during tumor proliferation and metastasis. Our
results suggest that use of G31P with or without other
chemotherapeutic drugs would improve therapeutic benefits
in the treatment of lung cancer.

RESULTS
CXCR1/2 expression in human lung cancer cell
lines and tissues
As non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) forms the
majority of lung cancer, we focus our efforts on NSCLC
in this study. We examined mRNA levels of CXCR1
and CXCR2 in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell
lines including A549, H460, H358, H1299, and H322. All
cancer cells express both CXCR1 and CXCR2, which is
consistent with previous data reported by Zhu et al. [18].
In comparison, H358 and H322 appear to contain lower
amounts of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mRNA than A549,
H460, and H1299, while A549 and H460 harbor highest
quantities of mRNA for CXCR1 and CXCR2 respectively
(Figure 1A). Additionally, we assessed secretion of
CXCL1, CXCL6, and CXCL8, chemokines for CXCR1/2,
in conditioned medium from NSCLC cells using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As expected,
secretion of CXCL1, CXCL6, and CXCL8 is evident for
H460, A549, and H358, with highest amounts from H460
and A549 cells (Figure 1B). We also compared mRNA
levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in lung cancer and normal
tissues from same patient (a group of 8). Both CXCR1
and CXCR2 predominately expressed in cancer tissues.
As shown in Figure 1C, CXCR1 mRNA was present in
normal tissues but at a lower level than in cancer tissues.
CXCR2 mRNA was almost deficient in normal tissues but
noticeably present in cancer tissues. We then inspected
CXCR2 protein expression in cancer and non-cancerous
tissues by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.
CXCR2 predominately expressed in cancer tissue than
normal tissue of human lungs (Figure 1D and 1E). Taken
together, these findings provide further evidence that
CXCR1/2 and their ligands are upregulated in lung cancer.
Since H460 and A549 express the most CXCR1 or CXCR2,
these two cell lines were chosen for following studies.

It has been reported that the expression levels of
some ELR-CXC chemokines is prognostic of patient

CXCR1 and CXCR2, we next assessed whether CXCR1/2
antagonism with CXCL8(3–72)K11R/G31P (hereafter G31P)
could affect the proliferation of these cells. We have
previously reported on the development and activities of
G31P in multiple models, including some cancers [21–25].
We assessed the effect of increasing concentrations of
G31P on H460 and A549 cell proliferation in vitro, using
CCK-8 assay. Both cell lines were sensitive to G31P,
which reduced their proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2A). When used at 100 ng/ml, G31P
inhibited H460 and A549 cell growth significantly (27%
and 30% respectively) compared to untreated cells. In
order to figure out whether such effect was mediated by
CXCR1/2, we carried out knockdown experiments with
siRNAs targeting CXCR1/2 and repeated cell proliferation
assays. CXCR1/2 knockdown led to comparable reduction
in cell proliferation with G31P treatment (100 ng/ml), and
combined treatment of both did not show additive antiproliferative effect (Figure 2B). These results suggest that
G31P exerts its anti-proliferative effect through CXCR1/2
receptors. Further, we examined impact of G31P on
expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 in these cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by immunofluorescence. G31P treatment reduced nuclear
expression of Ki-67 in both populations of cells (Figure
2C and 2D). Finally, we looked at cell cycle distribution of
H460 cells by flow cytometry following G31P treatment.
Results showed that G31P (100 ng/ml) significantly
reduced proportion of cells in S phase of cell cycle (Figure
2E and 2F).

G31P suppresses cell migration
As another means of evaluating the impact of ELRCXC chemokine antagonism on lung cancer cell vitality,
we examined the effect of G31P on the migratory abilities
of both H460 and A549 cells, using ‘wound healing’ and
chemokinesis assays. We found that cells treated with
increasing concentrations of G31P showed impaired
wound closure when compared with untreated group that
nearly closed the gap. We observed that G31P treatment
with 50 and 100 ng/ml significantly reduced the migrating
capability of lung cancer cells (to 46.89% and 39.48% for
H460 while 51.37% and 48.76% for A549 respectively,
Figure 3A and 3B). In addition, we assessed whether

ELR-CXC chemokine antagonism could affect chemo­
kinetic movement of tumor cells in modified Boyden
chamber assays. The upper chamber of each well was
loaded with cells and lower chambers with growth media
either as is or together with G31P (100 ng/ml) and IL-8
(20 ng/ml). After 2 h, we enumerated the cells that had
migrated through polycarbonate membrane into the lower
wells. As expected, both populations displayed substantial
chemokinetic activity, which was further enhanced by
IL-8. Addition of G31P reduced cell migration significantly,
which was phenocopied by CXCR1/2 knockdown, while
G31P treated siCXCR1/2 cells also exhibited resem­
bling defect. Represented photomicrographs of Giemsa
stained cells are shown in Figure 3C and quantification
in Figure  3D. Our findings demonstrate that G31P has

significant inhibitory effects on migration of non-small cell
lung cancer H460 and A549 cells.

ELR-CXC chemokine antagonism induces
apoptosis
We next assessed the apoptotic index in H460
and A549 cells and the impact of ELR-CXC chemokine
antagonism on this process, as determined by staining
with Hoechst 33342. This reagent stains the condensed
chromatin of apoptotic cells more brightly than the DNA
of non-apoptotic cells. As shown in Figure 4A, G31P
treatment increased the staining intensity of both H460 and
A549 cells. It induced 20 to 30% of H460 cells to become
apoptotic, whereas 18 to 25% of A549 were apoptotic after

48 h of G31P treatment (Figure 4B). We confirmed this by
flow cytometry where elevating concentrations of G31P
increased the amounts of apoptotic cells (Figure 4C).
Further, we performed immunoblotting experiments to
inspect expression of a range of apoptosis related proteins,
including PARP, Caspase-8, Bcl-2, and Bax. We observed
elevation of cleaved PARP and Caspase-8 as well as Bax
but a decrease in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 following G31P
addition, which collectively indicated a more apoptotic
characteristics compared to untreated group (Figure 4D).

These results suggest that G31P induces apoptosis by
regulating expression of these proteins.

G31P inhibits localized lung cancer growth and
metastasis in nude mice
To evaluate the effect of G31P on lung cancer
growth and metastasis in vivo, we established an
orthotopic lung cancer model in nude mice with GFP
expressing H460 cells. Mice were treated with G31P

G31P suppresses tumor angiogenesis in mice
model

(500 μg/kg) one week post tumor implantation for four
weeks. Fluorescent images of GFP expressing tumor in
mice demonstrated that G31P treatment significantly
reduced lung cancer formation and growth. Moreover,
tumor weight was reduced 64.25% ± 6.37% and tumor
volume was reduced 75.56% ± 9.30% relative to control
treated (Figure 5A and 5B). Histologically, tumors
in the G31P treatment group included large areas of
necrotic cells, with viable neoplastic cells comprising
only a small portion of the tissue within G31P-treated
tumors. In contrast, essentially the entire tumor mass
within vehicle-treated mice comprised viable tumor cells
(Figure 5D). TUNEL staining of tumor sections showed
that G31P treated tumors contained more apoptotic cells
(TUNEL positive cells) and smaller number of live cells
(GFP positive cells) than control group (Figure 5D).
We also assessed the impact of ELR-CXC chemokine
antagonism on tumor metastasis in this model. Control
group mice displayed metastasis throughout their
thoracic cavities, including to muscles and lymph nodes,
as compared to G31P-treated mice, wherein the tumors
largely remained localized to their primary implantation
sites, with negligible metastasis being discernible
(Figure 5E). Consistent with abovementioned data from
cancer cell lines, immunoblotting analyses of apoptotic
proteins including cleaved PARP, cleaved Caspase-8 and
Bax from G31P treated xenografts showed increased
intensity than control samples, with concurrent
decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
(Figure 5C).

An important facet of tumor progression is the
achievement of adequate vascular development to support
the growing tumor mass. As such, we studied the impact
of G31P treatment on a number of angiogenesis markers
in our tumor-bearing mice. We captured fluorescent
images of the tumors using a dissecting microscope and
calculated the microvessel densities of each tumor using
Image-Pro software. The mean vascular density (MVD)
of the tumors in the G31P-treated group was 0.45 ± 0.028
mm/mm2, while that in the control group was 0.930
± 0.04 mm/mm2 (Figure 6A). We then examined the
expression of PECAM-1/CD31, VEGF and NFкB-p65
proteins within the tumors using immunohistochemistry.
CD31 and VEGF are closely implicated in angiogenesis,
while NFкB-p65 is an inflammatory modulator and
angiogenic factor [27]. Immunohistochemical staining
of tumor sections for CD31, VEGF and NFкB-p65 was
quantified by IOD (integrated optical density), which
showed that G31P significantly reduced expression of
these important angiogenesis related proteins (Figure 6B).
Immunoblotting analyses of VEGF and NFкB-p65 showed
that ELR-CXC chemokine antagonism reduced expression
of both proteins in xenografts relative to vehicle-treated
tumors (Figure 6C). These results confirm that G31P
treatment leads to reduced expression of proteins involved
in the formation of new blood vessels and thus displays
potent anti-angiogenic activity.

G31P attenuates activation of MAPK and AKT

DISCUSSION

It is well-recognized that the expression levels
of ELR-CXC chemokines correlates with activation of
various signal transduction pathways for a number of
tumors. Hence we assessed whether G31P treatment
would affect expression of the activated forms of MAPK
(ERK1/2) and AKT in xenografts or among non-small
cell lung cancer cell lines. H460 and A549 cells were
pretreated with G31P at different concentrations and then
stimulated with IL-8 (20 ng/ml) for 30 minutes. Proteins
were isolated to determine the levels of phosphorylated
forms of ERK1/2 and AKT. In both H460 and A549 cells,
G31P treated cells showed reduced phosphorylation of
AKT and moderately decreased pERK1/2 levels, although
total AKT and ERK1/2 were unaffected (Figure 7A). H460
displays more reduced activation of AKT and ERK1/2
than in A549 cells. We also examined phosphorylation of
these proteins in xenograft tissues from our tumor bearing
mice. Samples from mice treated with vehicle (control
group) showed significantly more phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and AKT than those from G31P treated mice
(Figure 7B). Therefore, our in vivo and in vitro data
are consistent, which together suggest that CXCR1/2
antagonism by G31P inhibits the activation of MAPK and
AKT signaling pathways that play pivotal roles in lung
cancer progression.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
death in industrialized countries, largely because of the
advanced stage at which it is often diagnosed and of its
poor response to the presently available treatments [3].
As such, new, targeted treatment approaches are required.
CXCL8(3–72)K11R/G31P (G31P) is a low molecular weight
ELR-CXC chemokine inhibitor that has a higher binding
affinity for CXCR1 and CXCR2 than CXCL8 or any of its
sibling ELR-CXC chemokines [28]. This study focused on
the impact of CXCR1 and CXCR2 antagonism by G31P
on proliferation, migration, survival and growth of nonsmall cell carcinoma cells and tumors in vitro and in vivo,
the latter as determined in a xenograft mouse model. Our
results clearly indicate that G31P has inhibitory effects
on lung cancer growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis, at
least in part through its effects on the MAPK and AKT
signaling pathways.
The contribution of ELR-CXC chemokines such
as CXCL8/IL-8 and its receptors CXCR1/2 to cancer
progression, including non-small cell lung cancer, has been
well-documented [18–19]. Clinical studies have confirmed
that increased expression of CXCL8 is linked with tumor
development, suggesting that suppression of ELR-CXC
chemokines may be an important therapeutic approach for
aggressive and metastatic tumors. Expression of CXCL8

and its receptors correlates with angiogenesis, tumor
progression, and poor survival in non-small cell lung cancer
[20]. Indeed, using neutralizing antibodies to IL-8, Arenberg
and colleagues reported reduced tumor size and decreased
spontaneous metastasis in human non-small cell lung
cancer mice model [29]. Many non-small cell lung cancer
cell lines, including H460, A549, and H358 were shown to
produce CXCL8 and other ELR-CXC chemokines, while
small cell lung cancers produced low or insignificant levels
of CXCL8 [30, 31]. In the present study, we report that a
number of human lung cancer cell lines, as well as freshlyresected tumor tissues from cancer patients, express both
CXCL8 receptors CXCR1/2, which are consistent with
previous studies. It has been suggested that angiogenesis in
human NSCLC is mediated more by CXCR2 than CXCR1,
possibly due to the fact that CXCR2 is a receptor for a
more diverse array of ELR-CXC chemokines than CXCR1
[13–15]. In support of this notion, we did observe that nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines secreted several prominent
ELR-CXC chemokines, CXCL1/growth-related oncogene
alpha (GROα), CXCL6/granulocyte chemotactic protein 2
(GCP-2), and CXCL8/IL-8.
Several small molecule inhibitors that target ELRCXC chemokine receptor signaling have been developed
to suppress inflammatory disease and tumor growth [32].
In contrast, G31P is an engineered analogue of CXCL8
(i.e. CXCL8(3–72)K11R/G31P) that effectively antagonizes
all seven ELR-CXC chemokines, but also desensitizes
signaling via heterologous G protein-coupled receptors on
CXCR1- and/or CXCR2-expressing cells. G31P has been
shown to have important anti-inflammatory activities in
many forms of lung injury [21–23], and we have reported on
its protective effects as an anti-cancer drug in hepatocellular
carcinoma and prostate cancers [24–25]. Herein we further
evaluate its efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer.
Upregulation of ELR-CXC chemokine signaling
promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival, mainly
through modulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis
[16]. Silencing of CXCR2 controls cellular apoptosis by
affecting the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, leading
to cell cycle arrest in the G0-G1 and G2-M phases [15].
Our in vitro proliferative assay demonstrates that G31P
has dose-dependent inhibitory effects on lung cancer cell
proliferation, also supported by data from Ki-67 nuclear
staining. In agreement, treatment with G31P led to H460
accumulation in the sub G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Additionally, G31P suppressed migratory capacities of nonsmall cell lung cancer cells, as indicated by results from
wound healing and modified Boyden chamber experiments.
These defects appeared to be associated with CXCR1/2
expression as suggested by our siRNA mediated knockdown
experiments. G31P also stimulated apoptosis, as revealed
by increases in the expression of Bax, cleavage of PARP
and Caspase-8, together with increase in Hoechst 33342
staining. These in vitro effects were validated in vivo as well

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by our demonstration that G31P treatment of tumor-bearing
mice led to dramatic reduction in tumor volume, weight,
and metastasis, with augmented tumor cell apoptosis.
Heterotopic lung cancer models have been criticized
as not representative of lung cancers, in as much as the
primary tumor is anatomically distant from the lung. To
overcome this we used an orthotopic model in which we
implanted the primary tumor, with metastasis driving its
movement into nearby regions or lymph nodes. During
cancer growth, vascularization is a key factor to support
the development of tumors, wherein CXCL8 induces
endothelial growth through CXCR1 and CXCR2 signaling
[33–36]. Our in vivo results showed that G31P-treated
mice had substantially smaller primary tumors, with
little discernible tumor metastasis. Regarding impact
on angiogenesis, we observed decreases in VEGF and
NFкB-p65 expression in tumor tissues from G31P-treated
mice, with corresponding reduction in microvessel density
of these tumors. We also observed increased apoptosis in
G31P treated tumor using TUNEL staining, supported by
immunoblotting analyses of apoptotic proteins such as
PARP, Caspase-8, BAX, and Bcl-2. This pro-apoptotic
effect of G31P is likely further enhanced in vivo through
its inhibition on tumor tissue vascularization.
ELR-CXC chemokines stimulate a wide array
of downstream signaling molecules through binding to
CXCR1 and CXCR2, among which activation of MAPK
and AKT is closely implicated in cancer development
and progression. Upregulation of phosphorylated
forms of ERK1/2 and AKT has been detected in many
cancers, promoting tumor proliferation, invasiveness,
and metastasis, while inhibiting apoptosis. We observed
that ELR-CXC chemokine antagonism with G31P was
associated with attenuated signaling through each of
these within non-small cell carcinoma cell lines as well
as within intact tumors growing in nude mice. Of note, we
observed stronger reduction of the activation of ERK1/2
in vivo compared to in cell lines, which probably reflects
the additional effect of G31P on tumor microenvironment
that offers input to the Ras-MAPK cascade. These results
indicate the molecular mechanism by which G31P
suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis.
In conclusion, this study provides significant
evidence that CXCR1 and CXCR2 antagonism with
G31P inhibits lung cancer growth and metastasis,
through directly restraining cancer cell proliferation
and migration as well as stimulating apoptosis, but
also indirectly modulating tumor microenvironment by
suppressing angiogenesis. These events correlate with
effects on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, together
with expression levels of VEGF and NFкB-p65 at the
molecular level. Our findings collectively suggest that
G31P, via targeting CXCR1/2 signaling, can be considered
as an important factor in therapeutic strategies designed
for the clinical management of non-small cell lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Equal volume of growth media without G31P was added
in control wells. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified incubator. After 48 h, G31P containing media
was replaced from wells with 110 μl of RPMI containing
10 μl CCK-8 solution. After an additional incubation for
4 h, absorbance of each well was determine at 450 nm
and cell proliferation rate was calculated. Proliferation
rates of siRNA transfected H460 and A549 cells treated
with or without G31P were assessed in the same way
after 48 h of transfection.

All experiments were performed in accordance with
the 1996 National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and use of Laboratory Animals, and the experimental
procedures were approved by the Local Committee of
Animal Use and Protection.

Antibodies and other reagents
The following antibodies were used: rabbit antiCXCR2 (Abcam, USA), mouse anti-Ki67 (BD Biosciences,
USA), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473),
rabbit anti-ERK1/2, mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and
PARP (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA), mouse antiGAPDH, rabbit anti-Caspase-8, rabbit anti-Bax and Bcl2 (ProteinTech, USA), and rabbit anti-VEGF and NFкB
(Santa Cruz), mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich). G31P
is prepared as described previously [21, 22].

Ki-67 stain
Cells were cultured on glass coverslips. After 24 h of
G31P treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 minutes before treated with 0.2% Triton-PBS for 10
minutes. Cells were incubated in 2% BSA for 30 minutes
and then with anti-Ki-67 (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. After 3 times PBS washes PEconjugated secondary antibody was added for 30 minutes,
followed by three times PBS washes, and coverslips were
mounted on slide with 50 μl mowiol supplemented with
DAPI. Images were captured using inverted fluorescent
microscope (BX-51, TR32000 Olympus, Japan) and Ki-67
expression was calculated.

Cell culture and human samples
NSCLC lung cancer cell lines H460, A549, H1299,
H358, and H322 were cultured in complete RPMI-1640
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Hyclone) at 37°C in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2. Human lung cancer and
nearby noncancerous biopsies (n = 8) were obtained
from the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical
University, Liaoning, China. Human samples were
collected in accordance with the guidelines approved by
the Institutional Committee.

Wound healing assay
Wound healing assay was performed as described
previously [24]. In brief, cells were cultured in 12 well
plates to reach at least 80% confluence. Using a 200 μl
pipette tip, a wound was created in confluent monolayer
of cells and wells were rinsed twice with PBS. Next, cells
were incubated for 24 h in complete medium containing
G31P (at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml) at 37°C.
Cell migration was evaluated using inverted microscope
(Leica, Germany). Wound healing rate was quantified as
distance cells migrated across the injury line during 24 h
of incubation.

siRNA transfection
Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. siRNA sequences used are as follow: CXCR1,
5′-GGAGUUCUUGGCACGUCAUCGUGUU-3′ (forward)
and
5′-AACACGAUGACGUGCCAAGAACUCC-3′
(reverse); CXCR2, 5′-ACCGAGAUUCUGGGCAU
CCUUCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′- UGUGAAGG
AUGCCCAGAAUCUCGGU-3′ (reverse). In brief, 1 × 105
H460 and A549 cells were plated in RPMI medium with
10% FBS. Next day, cells were treated with siRNA targeting
CXCR1/2 or control reagents. Cells were incubated at 37°C
for 48 or 72 h and knockdown efficiency was assessed by
RT-PCR and immunoblotting.

Modified Boyden chamber chemokinesis assay
H460 and A549 cell migration was assessed using
modified Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg,
MD) microchemokinesis assays with 8 μm-pore sized,
fibronectin-coated polycarbonate membranes. CXCR1/2
siRNA and control treated cells in RPMI 1640 were loaded
into upper chamber and G31P (100 ng/ml) and IL-8 (20
ng/ml) in RPMI medium were filled in lower chamber. In
control group the lower chambers were filled with RPMI
1640. After 2 h at 37°C, cells that had migrated to the
lower surface of filter membrane were fixed in methanol
and stained with Giemsa solution. The mean number of
cells contained within microscopic fields was determined
by direct counting using a microscope (Leica, Germany).
Cells were counted from at least 3 wells from same group
in single experiment.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation assay was performed using cell
counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan).
H460 and A549 cells were plated in 96 well plates at
5000 cells/well and cultured for 12 h in 10% FBS
containing RPMI growth medium. Cells were treated
with G31P at concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 ng/ml.

h starvation, supernatant was collected and immediately
processed for ELISA as instructed by the manufacturer.

H460 and A549 cells cultured in RPMI-1640 media
were seeded in 6 well plate. After 12 h starvation, G31P was
added to final concentrations of 0, 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml.
After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and stained with
Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml). Incubation time was 30 minutes
at 4°C. Images were taken from 5 randomly chosen fields
under fluorescent microscope (BX-51, TR32000 Olympus,
Japan). More than 100 cells per field were counted and
graph was plotted with ratios of live and apoptotic cells.
In flow cytometry, H460 cells were seeded in 6 cm plate.
After G31P treatment (up to 100 ng/ml) for 24 h, cells
were harvested and washed with PBS at 4°C and adjusted
to cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. Cells were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) for 5 minutes.
After staining, cells were immediately analyzed with an
automatic flow cytometer (Accuri C6, BD Biosciences).
Data were analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.1.

GFP expressing cell line
To visualize orthotopic lung cancer cells in nude
mice, H460 cells were transfected with GFP expressing
vector. In brief, pEGFP plasmid was obtained from TaKaRa
biotechnology (Dalian, China). In transfection, H460 cells
were treated with 1:1 mixture of precipitated retroviral
PT67 cells (GFP expression packaging cells) supernatant
supplemented with RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. After 72 h
medium was changed to selective medium containing
G418. Stable GFP expressing clones were picked and
expanded using conventional culture method

Orthotopic lung cancer model in nude mice
Athymic female nude mice (4–6 weeks old Balb/c
background) were maintained in laminar airflow cabinets
under specific pathogen-free conditions, and provided free
access to irradiated pellet food and sterilized water. For the
xenograft model, GFP-expressing H460 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously in the right flank of three nude mice (5 ×
106 cells/0.2 ml PBS/mouse). Once the subcutaneous tumor
reached 1–1.5 cm in diameter, it was removed and cut into
about 1–2 mm3 cubes, which were implanted by micro-surgical
method into right lung of additional recipient nude mice, after
which the animals were randomized to receive either G31P
(0.5 mg/kg on alternative days, s.c.) or vehicle (saline solution,
s.c.) at one week after implantation (8 per group). Tumor
tissues were harvested 5 weeks after tumor implantation for
further experiments. Tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula: volume = (length × width2 /2), while microvessel
density (angiogenesis) was calculated as the micro-vessel
length per tumor area, determined by ImagePro Plus 6.0
software (Microsoft Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Cell cycle analysis
To analyze cell cycle distribution, 1 × 106 cells were
harvested and washed with PBS, then resuspended in 1 ml
PBS. The cells were fixed in 9 ml ice cold 75% ethanol at
4°C overnight and then washed with PBS and resuspended
in propidium iodide (20 μg/ml in PBS with 0.1%
Triton-X 100, Sigma Aldrich) and RNaseI (100 μg/ml,
Sigma Aldrich). Samples were incubated at 37°C in water
bath for 15 minutes and analyzed by flow cytometer
(Accuri C6, BD Biosciences).

CXCR1/2 mRNA expression
Total RNA was extracted from human tissue and nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines including H460, A549, H1299,
H358 and H322 using Trizol reagent according to instructions
(TaKaRa Bio, Dalian). cDNA was reverse transcribed using
Prime Script RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio, Dalian). QPCR
reaction was performed following manufacturer’s instructions
(TaKaRa Bio) with a thermal cycler (BioRad, USA). Relative
mRNA expression of each gene was normalized to GAPDH
levels. Primers used are as follow, CXCR1 (NM_000634.2)
5′-GAGCCCCGAATCTGACATTA-3′ (forward, 1466–1485)
and 5′-GCAGACACTGCAACACACCT-3′ (reverse, 1646–
1665); CXCR2 (NM_001557.3) 5′- ATTCTGGGCATC
CTTCACAG-3′ (forward, 1319–1338) and 5′-TGCAC
TTAGGCAGGAGGTCT-3′
(reverse,
1501–1520);
GAPDH (NM_002046.5) 5′-CCATCACTGCCACCCAGA
AGAC-3′ (forward, 727–748) and 5′-ATGACCTTGCC
CACAGCCTTG-3′ (reverse, 830–850).

TUNEL staining
Assessment for apoptosis was conducted
using a commercially available TUNEL assay kit
(Keygen Biotechnology, China). Briefly, sections were
deparaffinized, digested with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) at
37°C for 15 minutes, and soaked in PBS for 5 minutes.
DNA fragmentation was detected using TUNEL apoptosis
detection kit which specifically labeled 3′-hydroxyl termini
of DNA strand breaks using red fluorescent protein (RFP)conjugated dUTP. Each section was covered with labeling
solution for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. RFP
labeled DNA fragment were observed with a fluorescence
microscope (BX-51, TR32000 Olympus, Japan).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

were pre-incubated with 10% normal goat serum in PBS
(pH 7.5) followed by incubation at 4°C with primary
antibodies specific for PECAM-1/CD31 (1:100, Bioworld
technology, USA), NFкB-p65 (1:200, Santa Cruz, USA) or
VEGF (1:300, Santa Cruz). After PBS washes, samples were
incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies for 30
minutes at room temperature, then the target mediators were
visualized with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-complexes/
DAB, which gave a yellow-brown stain to positive tissues;
the sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin,
mounted and visualized under an inverted microscope (Leica,
Germany). Immunostaining intensity was calculated by using
a semi-quantitative method with software Image-Pro Plus 6.0
