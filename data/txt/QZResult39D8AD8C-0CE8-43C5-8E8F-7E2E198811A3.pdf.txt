BACKGROUND. The authors studied a dose-intense regimen of epirubicin and
ifosfamide with hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy for high-risk soft tissue sarcomas. The primary objective was estimation of the rate of 95% pathologic necrosis.
METHODS. Twenty-five patients with intermediate-grade or high-grade, localized
soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or body wall measuring >5 cm were treated
with epirubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on Days 1 to 4 and ifosfamide at a
dose of 2.5 g/m2/day on Days 1 to 4 every 21 days for 3 preoperative and 3 postoperative cycles. A total of 28 grays of radiation was administered over 8 fractions
during Cycle 2 of preoperative therapy (epirubicin was omitted).

RESULTS. Sixteen patients (64%) completed all chemotherapy cycles and the averDepartment of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and

Chemoradiation for High-risk Sarcomas/Ryan et al.

radiotherapy are reported to achieve local control in
up to 90% of patients, approximately half will die of
metastatic disease.1–4 The use of adjunctive chemotherapy in attempt to improve this outcome has
been associated with mixed results and to our knowledge there remains a dearth of definitive, prospective
data regarding the efficacy of such treatments.5–7
Multimodality therapy is nonetheless often employed
in the management of high-risk patients, with the
optimal regimen and timing of both chemotherapy
and radiation remaining dependent on the institution.
Neoadjuvant strategies for soft tissue sarcoma
have included radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone,
sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and concomitant chemoradiation using either interarterial or
intravenous chemotherapy.8–13 The advantages of
preoperative radiotherapy include the use of smaller
field sizes and lower doses, potentially reducing
long-term complications, although at the cost of an
increased incidence of acute wound healing complications.8,14 Potential advantages of preoperative
chemotherapy include the early treatment of micrometastatic disease, improved patient compliance,
and downsizing of tumors to facilitate surgical resection. In addition, preoperative chemotherapy and/or
radiation allows the evaluation of treatment effect
from the surgical specimen. The degree of pathologic
necrosis in the surgical specimen after chemoradiation has been associated with improved local control
and overall survival in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.15
In the current study, we investigated an intensified chemotherapy regimen consisting of epirubicin
and ifosfamide combined with preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients with large,
intermediate-grade or high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or body wall. The dose and
choice of chemotherapy agents was derived from a
randomized adjuvant study that at the time had
been reported as positively impacting survival.6 The
short-course, high-dose-per-fraction radiotherapy
approach was based on that developed by Eilber
et al. at the University of California Los Angeles.13
The objective of this open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase 2 study was the determination of the
rate of 95% pathologic necrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
Patients aged 18 years with a histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities or body
wall of intermediate or high grade were eligible.

2433

Excluded histologies were rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing
sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, osteosarcoma, or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Tumors
must have measured >5 cm in greatest dimension;
both superficial and deep tumors were allowed. No
regional lymph node involvement or metastases were
permitted. Required organ function included a left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50%, an absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL, a platelet count
100,000/lL, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, bilirubin 1.5
mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase levels 1.5 3 the upper limit of
normal. Patients were required to have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group/Zubrod performance
status16 of 0 or 1. No prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biotherapy was permitted. Patients must have
had no contraindications to limb-sparing surgery
and no severe peripheral vascular disease. No major
surgery within 4 weeks before study entry was
allowed. Patients must not have been pregnant or
breastfeeding, and patients of both genders had to
agree to practice suitable contraception throughout
the study. All patients provided written informed
consent as approved by the local institutional review
board.

Patient Treatment
Patients were treated at the following institutions:
Oregon Health and Science University, Portland,
Oregon; Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin; Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge,
Illinois; University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and
the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.
Baseline evaluation consisted of a medical history and physical examination, complete blood
count, serum chemistries, urinalysis, pregnancy test,
electrocardiogram, LVEF measurement (multiple
gated acquisition scan [MUGA] or echocardiogram),
computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan of the
primary tumor site. Patients underwent repeat physical examination and medical history before each
cycle of chemotherapy. The complete blood count
was checked twice weekly and serum chemistries
were checked once weekly during chemotherapy.
LVEF measurement was repeated before surgery and
at the completion of study treatment. Chest CT and
MRI scans or CT scans of the primary tumor site
were repeated before surgery. After the completion of
study treatment, patients were followed for disease
recurrence and survival by physical examination and
imaging studies at the discretion of the investigator;
suggested follow-up included that a chest CT scan or
chest x-ray be performed every 4 months for the first

2 years, every 6 months during the third year, and
yearly for the fourth and fifth years. It was suggested
that MRI or CT scans of the primary tumor site be
obtained yearly for the first 3 years.
The treatment schema is shown in Figure 1.
Chemotherapy consisted of 3 preoperative and 3
postoperative cycles. Surgery was planned for Week 9
and chemotherapy was resumed 4 weeks after
surgery. Each 21-day chemotherapy cycle included
epirubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day given intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes on Days 1 to 4 (epirubicin
was omitted during Cycle 2), and ifosfamide at a
dose of 2.5 g/m2/day administered intravenously
over 90 minutes on Days 1 to 4 of each cycle. Intravenous hydration, mesna, and antiemetics were
administered as per institutional standards. Filgrastim at a dose of 5 lg/kg/day was administered subcutaneously on Days 5 to 14 or pegfilgrastim at a
dose of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on Day 5
was given during each cycle. Treatment cycles were
not begun unless the patient’s absolute neutrophil
count was >1500/lL and the platelet count was
>100,000/lL. Dose reductions were undertaken for
the following: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >5 days,
neutropenic fever of any duration, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or any grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity
attributable to therapy, with the exception of nausea/
vomiting, hyperkalemia, and hypophosphatemia,
which were first treated with medical management.
Patients with a grade 2 decline in LVEF (20%
decline from baseline) were to be removed from protocol treatment.
External beam radiotherapy was initiated concomitantly at the start of Cycle 2 of chemotherapy and
consisted of 28 grays (Gy) administered as 8 fractions
of 3.5 Gy each during 10 days. The target volume of
radiotherapy included the site of the primary lesion
and those tissues suspected of involvement by microscopic disease to a clinically significant probability. Physical examination in conjunction with
imaging studies (MRI or CT) was used to define the
target volume with surgical margins beyond clinically
or radiologically evident sarcoma of 7 cm. A post-

operative radiotherapy boost was administered to
patients with positive surgical margins and consisted
of 12 Gy given in 6 daily fractions of 2 Gy each to
the bed of the residual tumor with a surgical margin
of 1 cm. The boost was administered beginning 2
weeks after resection, assuming satisfactory healing
of the surgical wound.
Surgical resection of the tumor was performed
with the intent of obtaining negative margins and
achieving limb conservation (minimal wide excision).
Dissection was performed through macroscopically
normal tissue planes and beyond the fascial plane
adjacent to the tumor. For tumors close to or displacing major vessels or nerves, an attempt to spare
these structures was made by removal of the adventitia or perineurium with negative surgical margins.
Frozen sections from the closest margin were performed at the time of surgery to confirm negative
margins. Special care was given to skin flaps, with
the use of muscle flaps, pedicled myocutaneous
flaps, and free flaps encouraged to fill dead space.
Although all patients were enrolled in the protocol
with the intent of limb sparing, patients with extremity tumors who at the time of surgery were not resectable without amputation underwent amputation
and completed chemotherapy thereafter.

Study Evaluation and Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was the determination of the
rate of 95% pathologic necrosis after 3 cycles of
combined chemoradiation. All pathology slides from
the initial diagnostic biopsy and the postchemoradiation excision were reviewed by a central pathologist
(A.G.M.) and the percentage of necrosis was estimated using a consistent procedure.
A 2-stage, phase 2 study design was employed
with a target accrual of 27 patients.17 If fewer than 3
of the first 10 patients were found to have 95%
pathologic necrosis, further accrual was to be terminated. The study design had a power of 0.90 to
detect a 95% pathologic necrosis rate of 50% in
favor of a rate of 25%, with a significance of .10. A
formal side effect monitoring plan using continuous
sequential probability ratio test rules18 was employed
to monitor for major postoperative wound complications, defined as those requiring further surgical
intervention. The study had a power of 0.661 to stop
the study for a wound complication rate of 25% in
favor of a rate of 10%, with a significance of .057.
Version 2.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was utilized for toxicity assessment. Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)19 were used for
response assessment of the primary tumor to pre-

RESULTS
Patient Population
Twenty-seven patients were enrolled between December 2002 and May 2005. One patient was found
to be ineligible (tumor measuring < 5 cm in size)
and no data were submitted for a second patient,
leaving 25 eligible and evaluable patients. The me-

dian follow-up for all patients was 24 months and
that for surviving patients was 26 months (range,
7–38 months for both). The baseline characteristics
of these patients are shown in Table 1. Seventeen
patients (68%) had tumors of the lower extremities.
Approximately 88% of tumors were high grade and
96% were deep. The median tumor size was 10 cm.

Treatment Delivery
A summary of chemotherapy delivery is shown in
Table 2. Sixteen patients (64%) completed all 6 cycles
of chemotherapy but only 4 patients (16%) completed all prescribed therapy without a dose reduction. Of the 9 patients who did not complete
chemotherapy, 2 were removed for adverse events
and 7 withdrew consent because of toxicity. All but 2
patients (92%) completed preoperative chemotherapy. The protocol specified a goal of performing surgery at 9 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy;
patients underwent surgery a mean of 10 weeks after
chemotherapy was initiated (range, 5–19 weeks), and
the majority of patients (76%) underwent surgery
between 9 and 11 weeks. Patients completed treatment an average of 2 weeks behind schedule (range,
3 days ahead to 45 days behind). The average delivered dose intensity of the regimen was 69% of that
planned.

y
Worst grade per patient and occurring in at least 10% of patients.

Toxicity
The most common grade 2 and higher adverse
events are shown in Table 3. Twenty-one patients
(84%) experienced grade 4 toxicity but only 4
patients (16%) experienced a grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Ten patients (40%) experienced neutropenic fever despite the routine use of prophylactic
colony-stimulating factor. Ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy manifesting as confusion and/or a
depressed level of consciousness was observed in 6
patients (24%); 4 of these patients discontinued
chemotherapy whereas 2 patients with grade 2 toxicity were able to complete therapy. Only 1 patient was
found to have a grade 1 decline in LVEF, but presurgery and end-of-study LVEF measurements were
available for only 18 patients (72%) and 11 patients
(44%), respectively. One patient developed end-stage
renal disease requiring dialysis after the completion
of study treatment that was attributed to ifosfamide.

No treatment-related deaths had been reported at
the time of last follow-up.
Postoperative wound complications requiring
surgical intervention occurred in 5 patients (20%)
and included debridement (1 patient each for dehiscence, deep infection, and fat necrosis), drainage of
seroma (1 patient), and 1 patient who required both
drainage of an abscess and angioplasty for venous
stenosis. Wound complications occurred in 4 patients
with thigh tumors and in 1 patient with a popliteal
fossa tumor.

Treatment Outcome
Limb salvage surgery was performed in 20 of the 22
patients with extremity tumors. The 2 extremity tumor patients who did not undergo limb salvage both
discontinued preoperative therapy because of complications (ifosfamide-related confusion and neutropenic fever, respectively) and underwent amputation
at the discretion of their surgeon. Both patients had
been considered to be candidates for limb salvage at
the time of study entry, although of borderline
potential because of the locally advanced nature of
their tumors. Three patients (12%) had microscopically positive surgical margins and received postoperative boost radiotherapy; 1 of these patients
developed a local disease recurrence.
Ten patients had 95% pathologic necrosis of
the surgical specimen after preoperative therapy, for
a 95% pathologic necrosis rate of 40% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 21–59%). One of these specimens had no evidence of histologically intact tumor.
Pathologic necrosis ranged from 10% to 100%, with
median pathologic necrosis of 80%. Three of 23
patients (13%) who were evaluable for radiographic
response were determined to have a partial response
by RECIST. 95% pathologic necrosis was observed
in 2 of these 3 patients (67%) with partial response, 6
of 16 patients (38%) with stable disease, and 1 of 4
patients (25%) with disease progression after preoperative therapy.
Kaplan-Meier plots of time-to-failure endpoints
are shown in Figure 2. At a median follow-up for distant disease recurrence of 22 months, 5 patients had
developed metastases. Two of these patients demonstrated 95% pathologic necrosis to preoperative
therapy. At a median follow-up of 23 months for
local disease recurrence among nonamputated
patients, 3 patients had a local disease recurrence
treated with reresection (2 patients) or amputation (1
patient); 1 of these patients demonstrated 95%
pathologic necrosis to preoperative therapy. At a median follow-up for survival of 24 months, 4 patients
had died (3 from metastatic sarcoma and 1 from a

second, unrelated cancer). The estimated 2-year rates
for OS, DDFS, and freedom from local disease recurrence were 84% (95% CI, 66–100%), 78% (95% CI, 61–
95%), and 88% (95% CI, 71–100%), respectively. The
estimated 2-year rate for overall DFS was 62% (95%
CI, 37–86%).

DISCUSSION
The utility of chemotherapy and its optimal integration into the multimodality management of high-risk
soft tissue sarcomas remains poorly defined. We performed a prospective, single-arm, clinical trial of a
new chemoradiation regimen for the treatment of
localized soft tissue sarcomas. Some of the distinctive features of this study include: 1) pathologic necrosis as the primary endpoint; 2) an intensified
chemotherapy regimen consisting of ifosfamide and
epirubicin, an agent newly available in the U.S. at

the time this study was initiated; and 3) a convenient, hypofractionated radiation scheme.
We observed a 95% pathologic necrosis rate of
40% (95% CI, 21–59%). High pathologic response
rates have also been reported with other aggressive
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens.10,11,15,21
Although an important prognostic factor in the treatment of osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma,22,23 to
our knowledge data supporting the prognostic value
of pathologic necrosis in the treatment of soft tissue
sarcomas are limited. To our knowledge, the 1 major
study investigating the prognostic value of pathologic
necrosis in soft tissue sarcomas was a retrospective
study in which the correlation between necrosis and
both local disease recurrence and survival was not
questioned before data collection and in which various radiation doses and chemotherapy regimens
were used.15 We did not observe a correlation
between 95% pathologic necrosis and any measures
of clinical outcome (log-rank test for OS, P 5 .7720;

2438

for DDFS, P 5 .6414; for freedom from local disease
recurrence, P 5 .5694, and for DFS, P 5 .6641), but
the small sample size did not permit adequate test of
association. The validation of pathologic necrosis as
a predictor of long-term outcome should be further
investigated in larger, prospective studies.
We observed a radiographic partial response rate
of only 13%, which is a commonly used endpoint in
solid tumor studies. No correlation between radiographic response and 95% pathologic necrosis was
obvious (Fisher exact test, P 5 .6556). Given the heterogeneous composition of soft tissue sarcomas, in
which viable tumor is often intermixed with areas of
pre-existing necrosis, hemorrhage, and fibrosis,
changes in tumor size may not correlate with chemotherapeutic effect. Indeed, to our knowledge, the
correlation between radiographic response to neoadjuvant therapy and pathologic and clinical outcome
in previous reports has been inconsistent.11,24–26 As
an alternative to radiographic imaging or pathologic
necrosis, functional imaging modalities may have the
potential to better predict response to neoadjuvant
therapy. The metabolic response of extremity sarcomas to preoperative chemotherapy on positron emission tomography scan has been correlated with
pathologic necrosis and has been suggested as a
potentially better indicator of distant disease recurrence.27 Prospective studies are needed to determine
the utility of such technology in selecting patients for
whom continued treatment with chemotherapy may
confer long-term benefit while sparing others from
the toxicity of further therapy.28
Trials investigating the utility of higher-dose
therapy with anthracyclines and ifosfamide in the
treatment of soft tissue sarcomas have had mixed
results, with randomized studies suggesting that
higher doses do not impart any additional clinical
benefit.29,30 It is clear that dose-intense regimens
such as ours are associated with significant toxicity.
Hematologic effects dominated the treatment toxicity
profile and ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity contributed to treatment discontinuation in 4 patients
(16%). Only 64% of patients completed all chemotherapy cycles, with the majority of treatment
discontinuations occurring in the postoperative segment. Similar findings were reported by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) using a
modified mesna, doxorubicin (adriamycin), ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (MAID)-based regimen with
standard protracted radiation in which only 59% of
patients completed all 6 cycles of treatment and
experienced a similar level of grade 4 toxicity.10 Our
observed rates of OS, DFS, and local disease recurrence are also similar to those of the RTOG study. In

light of recent data suggesting that the potential benefit of chemotherapy in high-risk sarcoma patients
may not be sustained beyond 1 year, utmost caution
must be taken against overinterpreting adjuvant studies with short-term follow-up.7
Wound complications are often considered the
major drawback to the preoperative administration
of radiotherapy. All the wound complications in the
current study occurred in patients with lower extremity sarcomas, the site most susceptible to such
complications.8 Although the study’s expected wound
complication rate of 10% approximates single-institution reports using chemoradiotherapy with shortcourse radiation,12,13 our actual observed rate of 20%
is more consistent with the results of the randomized
trial of preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy as reported by O’Sullivan et al.,8 a study that
used higher doses and standard-fractionation radiotherapy without chemotherapy.
In conclusion, in the current study we observed
a high rate of pathologic response after preoperative
treatment with an intensified chemoradiotherapy
regimen. Significant toxicity limited the administration of the intended dose intensity to most patients,
especially in the postoperative period. Although definitive, randomized studies remain necessary to
define the efficacy of adjunctive chemotherapy strategies in patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas,
the significant toxicity associated with this particular
regimen does not justify further study in the phase 3
setting. Future prospective studies of preoperative
chemoradiotherapy should be powered to validate
pathologic necrosis as a surrogate endpoint and
the investigation of other potential predictors of
outcome, such as functional imaging, should be
pursued.
