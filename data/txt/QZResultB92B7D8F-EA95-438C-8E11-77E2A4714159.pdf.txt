BACKGROUND: Induction therapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is similar across essentially all regimens,
comprised of vincristine, corticosteroids, and anthracyclines intensified with cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, or both. Given the lack
of randomized data, to date, no regimen has emerged as standard. The authors previously evaluated cytarabine 3 g/m2 daily for 5
days with mitoxantrone 80 mg/m2 (the ALL-2 regimen) as a novel induction regimen. Compared with historic controls, the ALL-2 regimen was superior in terms of incidence of complete remission, failure with resistant disease, and activity in patients with Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. METHODS: The authors conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial of the ALL-2 regimen
compared with a standard 4-drug induction (the L-20 regimen). Patients also received consolidation, maintenance therapy, and
central nervous system prophylaxis. The trial accrued patients from August 1996 to October 2004. RESULTS: The median follow-up
for survivors was 7 years, and the median patient age was 43 years. Responses were evaluated in 164 patients. The treatment arms
were balanced in terms of pretreatment characteristics. The frequency of complete remission for the ALL-2 regimen versus the L-20
regimen was 83% versus 71% (P ¼ .06). More patients on the L-20 arm failed with resistant disease (21% vs 8%; P ¼ .02). Induction
deaths were comparable at 9% (ALL-2) versus 7% (L-20). The median survival was similar; and, at 5 years, the survival rate was 33%
alive on the ALL-2 arm versus 27% on the L-20. CONCLUSIONS: Despite superior results of induction therapy with the ALL-2 regimen,
this treatment did not improve long-term outcomes. When coupled to the reported experience of other studies in adults with ALL,
the results of this randomized trial raise the possibility that ultimate outcomes in adult ALL may be independent of the specific

INTRODUCTION
Therapy for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be broadly classified as including induction,
consolidation, maintenance, and central nervous system prophylaxis. Despite marked improvement in the outcomes for
pediatric patients with ALL, the same success has not been realized for adult patients.
Current regimens induce a complete response/complete remission (CR) in approximately 60% to 90% of patients.
However, there is a substantial relapse rate, and only 20% to 40% of patients ultimately will be cured of their disease.1-8
Multiple studies have confirmed the importance of several prognostic features, including age, immunophenotype, white
blood cell (WBC) count, cytogenetic abnormalities, and the time to achieve a CR.9,10 On the basis of these observations,
several groups have tested more aggressive acute myeloid leukemia ‘‘(AML)-style’’ induction therapies to induce more rapid
CRs and, in this manner, attempt to increase the likelihood of a cure.11-13 Previously, we conducted a phase 2 study of
‘‘AML-style’’ therapy, the ALL-2 regimen, which combined high-dose cytarabine with a very high single dose of mitoxantrone (80 mg/m2). In that study, patients did not receive vincristine or steroids during induction therapy. The initial choice
of high-dose mitoxantrone came from preclinical trials that demonstrated a steep dose-response curve for mitoxantrone
when tested in vitro against leukemic blasts.14 This was then bolstered by a phase 1 clinical and pharmacologic evaluation.15
On the basis of the preclinical and phase 1 trial data, we tested this ALL-2 regimen in adult patients with ALL.

When the results of this regimen were compared
with a historic control group (patients who were treated
on the last Memorial Hospital vincristine/prednisonebased regimen [‘‘L-20’’]), we observed several differences.
The incidence of CR (84% vs 67% for the ALL-2 regimen
vs the L-20 regimen, respectively; P ¼ .056) and the time
to CR (34 days vs 61 days, respectively; P ¼ .005) were
superior on the ALL-2 regimen. ALL-2 also appeared to
be superior in patients who had Philadelphia chromosome
(Ph)-positive ALL, with improved incidence of complete
hematologic response (100% vs 61%; P ¼ .14) and complete cytogenetic response (100% vs 45%; P ¼ .056). The
survival curves for patients with Ph-positive disease also
suggested a benefit for the patients who received ALL-2
(median not reached: >12 months vs 8.8 months; P ¼
.052). These results suggested that the ALL-2 regimen
may be a superior form of induction therapy for adult
patients with ALL; and, given the limitations inherent in
comparisons with historic controls, we conducted a prospective randomized trial of the ALL-2 regimen versus the
L-20 program.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The patients who participated had previously untreated
ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patients were required
to have adequate hepatic, renal, and cardiac function. All
patients gave their written informed consent. The participating centers were Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, Emory University, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of California-Los Angeles, Duke University Medical Center, New York Medical College, and

at all participating institutions.
Treatment Arms

Patients were randomized to treatment on either the ALL2 or L-20 treatment regimen. The ALL-2 regimen was
comprised of induction with cytarabine and high-dose
mitoxantrone followed by 4 cycles of consolidation as
follows: Consolidation A with vincristine and prednisone,
Consolidation B with high-dose cyclophosphamide,
Consolidation C with etoposide and cytarabine, and
Consolidation D with pegaspargase (if unavailable, then
substitution with L-asparaginase was permitted). Maintenance therapy was administered for 2 years as previously
described (Tables 1 through 7).
The L-20 regimen was comprised of induction with
vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of consolidation as follows:
Consolidation A with cytarabine and daunorubicin,
Consolidation B with cytarabine and methotrexate,
Consolidation C with pegaspargase (if unavailable, then
substitution with L-asparaginase was permitted), and
Consolidation D with cyclophosphamide (Tables 8
through 12). Maintenance therapy was the same as the
ALL-2 schedule (Tables 6 and 7).

Original Article

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission was only permitted for patients with Ph-positive disease and a t(4;11) translocation. Such patients typically
underwent transplantation after Consolidation A.
Evaluation Criteria

Responses were graded as complete if there was disappearance of all clinical evidence of leukemia for a minimum of
4 weeks. The patient had to have a neutrophil count
>1000  106/L, a platelet count >100,000  106/L,
no circulating blasts, and 5% blasts on bone marrow

differential in a normal or hypercellular bone marrow. In
contrast to many studies, we required 2 remission bone
marrows performed at least 28 days apart. Studies of minimal residual disease using flow cytometric or molecular
tests were not required.
Treatment failure included increasing bone marrow
infiltrate or the development of organ failure or extramedullary infiltrates because of leukemia. Patients had to
achieve a complete bone marrow response by the end of
Consolidation A. Partial responses at the end of Consolidation A were considered treatment failures, and those
patients were removed from study.

Toxicities were evaluated according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.
Statistical Design and Methods: Sample Size

The primary endpoint for this trial was a comparison of
the frequency of response between the 2 arms. The secondary endpoints comparisons of the time to CR, the
length of hospital stay, efficacy in Ph-positive ALL, and
the fraction of patients achieving durable (>5-year)
responses. The study was designed to detect a 20%
improvement in the probability of CR from 67% to 87%
using a sequential design. The target accrual was 77 evaluable patients per arm to detect this difference with a power
of at least 80%, and the O’Brien and Fleming stopping
rule was used to maintain an overall significance level of
5%. The sequence of nominal significance levels used was
P ¼ .0005, P ¼ .0124, and P ¼ .0455 for the interim and
final analyses, respectively. Randomization was accomplished by the method of random permuted block with
treating institution as a stratification factor.

progression of disease. Subgroup comparisons of overall
and disease-free survival were performed using the logrank test. Analyses were performed using both the intentto-treat principle, which included all registered patients
(eligible and ineligible), and all evaluable patients.
Frequency of toxicities was reported based on National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The secondary endpoints comparing the 2 regimens were the time to

was no significant difference in overall survival (Fig. 1, Table 15). Survival curves for patients with B-lineage, T-lineage and Ph+ disease are illustrated in Figures 2-4.
Eighteen patients underwent allogeneic stem cell
transplantation in first CR, and an additional 29 patients
underwent transplantation in the salvage setting after they
failed protocol therapy. Of these 47 patients (29%) who
underwent allogeneic transplantation, there were 25
patients in the ALL-2 arm, and 9 of those patients remain
alive; and there were 22 patients in the L-20 arm, and 5 of
those patients remain alive.

leukemia stratified by treatment arm. ALL2 indicates the
acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimen (cytarabine 3 g/m2
daily for 5 days with mitoxantrone 80 mg/m2); L20, the

cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of
consolidation).

Twenty-nine patients (18%) had Ph-positive disease. This
study was designed and largely conducted in the preimatinib era, and patients did not receive tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The frequency of CR was greater for patients with
Ph-positive disease in the ALL-2 arm compared with their
counterparts in the L-20 arm (85% vs 47%; P ¼ .04).
Survival for patients with Ph-positive disease at 6 years
was 36% in the ALL-2 arm compared with 7% in the
L-20 arm (Fig. 4).
Toxicity

The incidence of severe adverse events was similar in
both arms (77 events [44 patients] in the ALL-2 arm
vs 70 events [39 patients] in the L-20 arm; P value
nonsignificant). Although patients in ALL-2 arm
spent more time in the hospital during induction
(median, 32 days vs 28 days), they spent fewer days
in the hospital overall (70 days vs 81 days for those
on the L-20 arm). An unusual toxicity noted in the
ALL-2 arm was a second wave of myelosuppression
that typically occurred between days 60 and 120,
which probably was caused by the high-dose mitoxantrone as previously reported.11-13,16
DISCUSSION
In 1971, Clarkson and Fried reported the results of a 4drug induction regimen in adults with ALL.17 Since that
early report, numerous regimens have been developed to
treat these patients, but it is not clear that any of these regimens offer a substantial improvement over this early

experience nearly 40 years ago. It is widely accepted that
attaining a CR is absolutely essential for long-term survival and that regimens that can induce very high proportions of CRs are likely to cure more patients than
regimens that achieve lower frequencies of CRs. In addition, essentially every published study on treating adults
with ALL has indicated that patients who achieve their
CR rapidly are more likely to be cured than patients who
take longer than 4 or 5 weeks to achieve a CR. On the
basis of these findings, many programs over the last 3 dec1192

ades have focused on developing more intensive regimens
to achieve a high frequency of CRs and to do so in a
shorter time frame.
Some groups have focused on developing regimens
with a more intensive induction,1,2,18,19 whereas others
have studied intensifying consolidation or maintenance.3,20-26 To our knowledge, none of these other
intensified regimens have been compared in a prospective
randomized fashion; therefore, it is not possible to know
with certainty whether any of these approaches increase
the likelihood of cure.
Against this background, Weiss et al reported a
phase 2 trial of a novel regimen that demonstrated a high
CR frequency and substantially reduced the time to CR
compared with historic controls.11 Those results led to the
current national, multicenter, prospective randomized
trial of an induction based on high-dose mitoxantrone
and cytarabine compared with a more traditional 4-drug
induction regimen.
The results from this trial may suggest some farreaching conclusions. In this study, several findings stand
out. The more aggressive ALL-2 arm was superior in
terms of time to CR (P ¼ .001) and failure with resistant
disease (P ¼ .02). The frequency of CR appeared to be
superior in the ALL-2 arm, though the P value had borderline significance (P ¼ .06). Despite the apparent superiority of the ALL-2 regimen in terms of early surrogate
markers, the 2 treatment arms had nearly identical
survival curves.
This result calls into question the long-held belief
that developing a regimen that induces more patients into
remission faster would improve long-term outcomes.
Rather, the results from this trial suggest that only a fraction of adults has a ‘‘curable’’ form of ALL and that, as
long as certain treatment parameters are included, the specifics of the treatment regimen do not matter. Taking this
argument 1 step further, regimens that tout high frequencies of CR or the ability to achieve a CR quickly are likely
ultimately to be no better than less aggressive regimens
that achieve a lower proportion of CRs. In this view, such
CRs are more ‘‘cosmetic’’ than of true clinical importance.
Although, in the most technical sense, the results of
this trial are applicable only to the 2 regimens that are
compared, there are supporting arguments that need to be
considered. In his landmark analysis, Ohno described a
tight correlation between the median age of patients
treated on a specific regimen and long-term (4-year,
5-year, or 6-year) survival.27 The analysis by Ohno used
age as the only predictive feature; presumably an analysis
that incorporated other prognostic features may have even

more accurately predicted long-term survival. The ability
to accurately predict treatment results based solely on
patient characteristics, independent of treatment regimen,
strongly supports the concept that selected individuals
have curable disease regardless of the regimen used. A second finding that can be derived from the analysis of Ohno
is that the predictive model is not influenced by the time
to CR or the fraction of patients achieving CR. Indeed,
the time to CR and the frequency of CR appear to be predictive only within individual trials and do not correlate
with long-term survival across trials. This reinforces the
well recognized problem of comparing different phase 2
trials and, ultimately, the vital importance of conducting
phase 3 randomized trials.
Recently, several trials have reported high frequencies of CR. A closer look at 2 of those trials—the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group-Medical Research Council
(ECOG-MRC) 2993 trial3 and the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (Hyper-CVAD) regimens2—can be informative.
The large ECOG-MRC United Kingdom ALL trial
reported a CR frequency of 91% and a 5-year overall survival rate for all 1913 patients of 39%. Those results suggest that, in that study, the high CR frequency led to
improved long-term survival compared with the regimens
reported by others, including the regimens described in
the current report. Such a simple comparison, however,
ignores a fundamental issue: namely, differences in pretreatment patient characteristics. The ECOG-MRC trial
was performed in patients predominantly aged 60 years,
and the median age was 31 years.28 The younger age of
patients treated on the ECOG-MRC trial compared with
the current study likely accounts for the differences in outcome. Age at diagnosis powerfully affects outcomes in this
disease, as can be seen in the ECOG-MRC trial, in which
<15% of patients were long-term survivors if they were
aged >50 years at the time of treatment.
Our colleagues at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center have reported the efficacy of
Hyper-CVAD in 288 patients2 who had a CR frequency
of 92%, but the estimated 5-year survival rate was 38%.
That study included older patients (median age, 40 years),
with 20% aged >60 years; and, as is typical, the older
patient cohort in that study had a lower CR frequency
and high frequency of treatment-related mortality.
All of these studies have succeeded in achieving a
high frequency of CRs. But improvement in long-term
survival has remained elusive. When the results of the current trial are viewed in the context of treatment results of
Cancer

other regimens it becomes more evident that the specifics
of the treatment program may affect the fraction of
patients achieving a CR and the time to CR but does not
affect the likelihood of cure. Given this analysis it seems
likely that improvements in curing more adults with ALL
will require new drugs. Unfortunately the current structure of clinical research in adult ALL makes it difficult to
evaluate new strategies and incorporate new drugs in a
timely fashion. To study this uncommon disease cooperative groups are often needed and still these studies frequently require more than 10 years for meaningful accrual
(this study was 1996-2004 at 7 sites; the MRC UKALL/
ECOG was 1993-2006 at more than 100 sites).
Therefore, it is not surprising that progress in adult
ALL has been so limited. Molecular markers in ALL have
only recently been described, including the transcription
factor Erg; expression of the orphan homeobox gene
HOX11L2; cytoplasmic (BAALC) gene expression;
Notch/F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7
(FBXW7) mutations; and others. However, the best way
to alter therapy based on this information remains uncertain. It seems likely that true progress in this disease
depends on the development of new agents with novel
mechanisms of action that target either common features
of the disease, such as blinatumomab,29 or specific molecular subtypes, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Phpositive ALL and possibly gamma-secretase inhibitors for
Notch-1–activating mutations in T-cell ALL. In conclusion, it remains clear that a concerted effort is needed to
enroll these patients onto clinical trials that are evaluating
novel therapies with the ultimate goal of increasing the
fraction of patients who are cured of their disease.
