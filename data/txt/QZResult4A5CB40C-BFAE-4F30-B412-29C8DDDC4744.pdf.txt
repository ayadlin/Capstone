ABSTRACT
Background: Aging augments endotoxemic cardiac dysfunction, but the
mechanism remains unclear. Anti-aging protein Klotho has been found to modulate
tissue inflammatory responses. We tested the hypothesis that a reduced Klotho level
in aging heart plays a role in the augmented endotoxemic cardiac dysfunction.
Materials and Methods: Endotoxin (0.5 mg/kg, iv) was injected to adults (4-6
months) and aging (18-20 months) C57BL/6 mice. Recombinant Klotho (10 μg/kg, iv)
was administered to a group of aging mice after endotoxin injection. Cardiac function
was analyzed using a microcatheter at 24 and 48 h after endotoxin administration.
Myocardial levels of Klotho and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were determined by
immunoblotting, and plasma and myocardial cytokines were analyzed using ELISA.
Results: More severe cardiac dysfunction in aging mice were accompanied by
greater cytokine levels in the plasma and myocardium. Klotho was detected in the
myocardial tissue. Klotho levels were lower in aging hearts and were further reduced
during endotoxemia. Myocardial HSP70 levels were correlated with Klotho levels.
Recombinant Klotho increased myocardial HSP70, inhibited NF-κB activation, reduced
cytokine levels, and improved cardiac function in aging endotoxemic mice. Delivery
of HSP70 into cultured macrophages suppressed endotoxin-induced NF-κB activation.
Conclusions: Aging-related augmentation of inflammatory responses and
cardiac dysfunction is associated with relative Klotho deficiency. Post-treatment with
recombinant Klotho suppresses the inflammatory responses and improves cardiac
function in aging endotoxemic mice. Klotho modulates HSP70 levels and HSP70
appears to be involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Klotho. Klotho may
have therapeutic potential in amelioration of aging-related endotoxemic cardiac
dysfunction.

production of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators [6].
Up-regulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
the myocardium, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays an important role in
cardiac contractile depression during endotoxemia [7–10].
We previously observed that the augmented inflammatory
responses in aging endotoxemic mice, in comparison to
adult endotoxemic mice, leads to more severe cardiac
dysfunction [5]. Currently, the mechanism by which aging
augments the inflammatory responses to endotoxemia is
incompletely understood. As major surgeries performed

INTRODUCTION
Trauma and stress associated with major surgery
can result in endotoxemia and the systemic inflammatory
response by eliciting gut bacteria translocation [1]. It
is well known that endotoxemia causes cardiovascular
dysfunction. While the general immunological function
is decreased with aging, the inflammatory response to
endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) is enhanced in old
animals [2–5]. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a central
role in the regulation of LPS signaling and LPS-induced

in the elderly is increasing, understanding of the impact
of endotoxemia and inflammatory responses on cardiac
function in aging subjects is helpful for improving postsurgery outcomes in the elderly.
Klotho is an anti-aging protein that is identified
initially in the kidney [11]. Now, expression of Klotho
has been found in several other tissues, including blood
vessels [12]. Klotho has been found to regulate energy
metabolism, exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative
effects, and modulate calcium and mineral homeostasis
[13–15]. Klothos has also been implicated in vascular
health and disease [16], and several studies suggest that
Klotho has a cardioprotective effect [17]. Further, Klotho
appears to modulate tissue inflammatory responses to
injury or interact with inflammatory mediators [18, 19].
However, the mechanism by which Klotho exerts a
cardioprotective effect remains to be determined. Further,
it is unclear whether Klotho is expressed in the heart
and whether aging and endotoxemia have an impact on
myocardial Klotho levels.
Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is an inducible
isoform of the 70 KD heat shock protein family and
protects cells and tissue against stress and injury [20].
HSP70 can modulate the response to inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β [21]. Additionally,
HSP70 could modulate the inflammatory status,
preventing the inflammatory tissue damage caused by the
aging-related chronic inflammation [22, 23]. Currently, the
impact of aging on myocardial HSP70 levels is unclear.
In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that
the worse cardiac dysfunction in aging endotoxemic
mice is associated with reduced levels of Klotho in the
myocardium and that HSP70 is involved in the antiinflammatory mechanism of Klotho. We further proposed
that recombinant Klotho has the therapeutic potential in
mitigation of the inflammatory responses and cardiac
dysfunction in aging endotoxemic mice. The present
study determined: (1) the basal levels of Klotho and
HSP70 in aging mouse heart and the effect of endotoxemia
on their levels, (2) whether augmented inflammatory
responses and more severe cardiac dysfunction in aging
endotoxemic mice are associated with relative Klotho
deficiency, (3) the relationship between Klotho and HSP70
during endotoxemia in aging mice and (4) the therapeutic
potential of recombinant Klotho for amelioration of agingrelated inflammation and cardiac dysfunction.

study, we prolonged the time course. The pressurevolume loops presented in Figure 1A show representative
LV function in terms of temporal pressure and volume.
Compared to the saline control group, developed pressure,
ejection fraction and cardiac output were lower at 24 h in
LPS-treated adult or aging mice. However, significantly
greater decreases in LV function parameters were
observed in aging mice (Figures 1A and 1B). At 48 h after
LPS administration, developed pressure was recovered to
the baseline in adult mice, but remained lower than the
baseline in aging mice. Although ejection fraction and
cardiac output were improved in adult mice at this time
point, they were comparable to those at 24 h in aging mice
(Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, endotoxemia causes more
severe and sustained LV dysfunction in aging mice.
Administration of LPS increased chemokine (MCP1 and KC) and cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) levels in
the myocardial tissue and plasma in both adult and aging
mice at 24 and 48 h (Tables 1 and 2). In comparison to
adult mice, aging mice had greater levels of chemokine
and cytokine in the myocardium and plasma at both time
points (Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, the more severe and
sustained LV dysfunction in aging mice was associated
with augmented inflammatory responses.

Endotoxemia reduces Klotho and HSP70 protein
levels in hearts of aging mice
Whereas Klotho levels were lower in the kidneys
of aging mice, no age-related difference in liver Klotho
levels was observed (Figure 2). Klotho was detectable
in the myocardial tissue, and its levels in aging hearts
were markedly lower compared to those in adult hearts
(Figure 2). Aging hearts also displayed lower levels of
HSP70 (Figure 2). Thus, Klotho protein is present in
the heart, and reduced levels of myocardial Klotho in
aging mice is accompanied by lower levels HSP70 in the
myocardium.
Interestingly, we observed that endotoxemia caused
a further reduction of cardiac Klotho and HSP70 levels
(Figure 3). In adult hearts, Klotho and HSP70 levels were
reduced at 24 h and recovered at 96 h after injection of
LPS. However, Klotho and HSP70 levels were much
lower at 24 h in aging hearts and failed to recover by 96 h
(Figure 3). It appears that endotoxemia reduces myocardial
levels of Klotho and HSP70, and it has a greater impact on
aging hearts.

RESULTS

Recombinant Klotho preserves myocardial
HSP70 levels and improves LV function

Endotoxemia causes more severe and sustained
LV dysfunction in aging mice

We used recombinant Klotho to determine the
effect of Klotho on myocardial HSP70 levels and cardiac
dysfunction in aging mice. Aging mice treated with
recombinant Klotho after administration of LPS had higher
HSP70 levels in the myocardium than aging mice treated

We previously reported that at 6 h after administration of LPS, aging mice display greater cardiac
depression in comparison to adult mice [5]. In the present

with LPS+saline (Figure 4A). More importantly, cardiac

results indicate that relative Klotho deficiency plays a role
in myocardial HSP70 decline and cardiac dysfunction in
aging endotoxemic mice.

markedly reduced the inflammatory responses, lowering
chemokine and cytokine levels in the myocardium and
plasma at 24 and 48 h (Tables 3 and 4) and. It appears that
recombinant Klotho suppresses the myocardial production
of pro-inflammatory mediators via inhibition of NF-κB
activation.

Klotho suppresses myocardial NF-κB activation
and inflammatory mediator production

HSP70 suppresses macrophage NF-κB activation
caused by LPS stimulation

To determine the effect of recombinant Klotho on
myocardial inflammatory responses in aging endotoxemic
mice, we analyzed myocardial NF-κB activation and
inflammatory mediator production.
As shown in Figure 5A, myocardial NF-κB activity
was elevated at 6 h after LPS treatment and returned to the
baseline level in adult mice. In contrast, myocardial NFκB activity was higher at 6 h and remained elevated at 24
h in aging mice (Figure 5A). Thus, a sustained myocardial
NF-κB activation in aging hearts was associated higher
myocardial levels of chemokines and cytokines observed
at 24 and 48 h (Table 1).
Treatment of aging mice with recombinant
Klotho after administration of LPS decreased the
levels of myocardial NF-κB activation at both 6 and
24 h (Figure 5B). Similarly, treatment of aging mice
with recombinant Klotho after administration of LPS

As the data presented above indicate a link between
HSP70 and Klotho, we examined whether HSP70
modulates NF-κB activation, using liposomal delivery of
recombinant HSP70 to primary macrophages that have low
levels of HSP70 and high sensitivities to TLR4 stimulation.
While HSP70 was barely detectable in macrophages
treated with control liposomes (liposomes+saline),
treatment with liposomal HSP70 increased cellular HSP70
levels in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 6A). Liposomal
HSP70 at 25 μg/ml markedly increased cellular HSP70
levels. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed increased
HSP70 levels in cells treated with 25 μg/ml of liposomal
HSP70 and revealed that the delivered HSP70 is primarily
in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear regions (Figure 6B).
Interestingly, NF-κB intranuclear translocation following
LPS stimulation was essentially abrogated in cells with
higher HSP70 levels (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION

dysfunction. The present study provided several novel
findings. First, Klotho protein is present in the myocardial
tissue, and baseline Klotho levels in aging hearts are lower
compared to those of adult hearts. Second, endotoxemia
causes a reduction of myocardial Klotho levels in both
adult and aging hearts, and the impact of endotoxemia is
greater in aging hearts. Third, myocardial Klotho levels
fail to recover during the experimental period in aging
hearts, resulting in extremely low myocardial Klotho
levels accompanied by higher myocardial levels of proinflammatory cytokines and more severe LV functional
injury. Lastly, treatment of aging endotoxemic mice with
recombinant Klotho reduces cytokine levels and improves
cardiac functional performance. It appears that agingrelated relative Klotho deficiency and down-regulation of
Klotho by endotoxemia, particularly in aging hearts, plays
an important role in the mechanism of the augmented
myocardial inflammatory responses and more severe
cardiac dysfunction observed in aging endotoxemic mice.
Recombinant Klotho may have therapeutic potential for
modulation of myocardial inflammatory responses to
endotoxemia and amelioration of endotoxemic cardiac
dysfunction in aging subjects.

Major surgery that has been performed more
frequently on the elderly can cause sterile endotoxemia.
Endotoxemia frequently results in cardiac dysfunction and
has a significant impact on post-surgery outcomes [1, 24,
25]. Thus, understanding of the impact of endotoxemia on
tissue inflammatory responses and organ function in aging
subjects is helpful for improving clinical outcomes in the
elderly undergoing major surgery.
Previous studies demonstrate that anti-aging protein
Klotho has an anti-inflammatory effect in animal models
of tissue ischemia and reperfusion injury [26] and aging
is associated with relative Klotho deficiency [27]. It
has been documented that the myocardial inflammatory
responses to endotoxin are enhanced in old animals and
such responses result in more severe cardiac dysfunction
[2–5]. The current study focused on the role altered Klotho
levels in aging-related myocardial inflammatory responses
and cardiac dysfunction, and we are particularly interested
in the effect of Klotho on endotoxemic pathology in aging
subjects, as well as the therapeutic potential of recombinant
Klotho in mitigation of aging-related endotoxemic cardiac

We previously reported that old mice had enhanced
myocardial inflammatory responses to endotoxemia that
result in exaggerated cardiac contractile depression at
6 h after administration of endotoxin [5]. In the present
study, we extended the time trial to 24 and 48 h following
administration of endotoxin. Cardiac function examined
using a pressure-volume microcatheter is moderately
decreased at 24 and 48 h in adult mice. In aging mice,
however, endotoxemia causes more severe cardiac
dysfunction at both time points. Cardiac functional
injury in aging endotoxemic mice is accompanied
by greater levels of cytokines and chemokines in the
myocardium and plasma at 24 and 48 h. Similarly, aging
hearts display higher and prolonged NF-κB activation in
comparison to adult hearts. Thus, more severe cardiac
dysfunction in aging mice is associated with greater
and prolonged myocardial inflammatory responses. As
pro-inflammatory cytokines are cardiodepressive [5, 8,
28], it is reasonable to postulate that greater levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the myocardium of aging
mice are responsible, at least in part, for the more severe
cardiac dysfunction.
The aging process is characterized by a chronic
oxidation-inflammation state [29]. While multiple factors
contribute to the aging process and/or accelerate aging, the

role of Klotho in aging has attracted great attention [30,
31]. Recognized functions of Klotho include the regulation
of energy metabolism, modulation of calcium homeostasis
and anti-oxidative stress [14, 15, 32–34]. In addition, this
anti-aging protein has been found to play a role in antiinflammation [26]. Interestingly, we observed that Klotho
protein is detectable in the heart. The levels of Klotho
are lower in aging hearts than those in adult hearts. Thus,
Klotho protein is also present in the heart and aging affects
myocardial Klotho levels. A similar age-related difference
in Klotho levels is observed in the kidney, but not in the
liver. It is possible that liver-derived Klotho becomes an
important source of extracellular Klotho in endotoxemic
aging mice where Klotho levels in the kidneys and heart
are significantly reduced.
We report here for the first time that endotoxemia
decreases myocardial Klotho levels. While myocardial
Klotho levels can recover to the baseline over time in
adult endotoxemic mice, they fail to recover over the same
time period in aging mice, which results in extremely low
Klotho levels in aging hearts during endotoxemia. The
lower myocardial Klotho levels are associated with greater
NF-κB activation and augmented elevation of cytokine
levels. It should be noted NF-κB activation is transient,
but elevated cytokine levels last for a longer period. In this

with immunoblotting at 24 and 96 h after treatment. Representative immunoblots and densitometric data show that endotoxemia causes
a reduction in myocardial Klotho and HSP70 levels at 24 h in adult mice, and myocardial levels Klotho and HSP70 are recovered to the
baseline at 96 h. In aging mice, Klotho and HSP70 levels are also reduced at 24 h, but remain low at 96 h following LPS treatment. Data

regard, NF-κB serves as an initiation signal; the production
of pro-inflammatory mediators may not be shut off after
NF-B is inactivated and cytokine protein degradation takes
time. Thus, the elevation of cytokines is prolonged and proinflammatory mediators have relatively longer effects.
Treatment of aging endotoxemic mice with
recombinant Klotho significantly reduces myocardial
NF-κB activity and cytokine levels. These data

support the notion of an interaction between Klotho
and inflammation. Namely, inflammation can downregulate Klotho levels and Klotho negatively modulates
inflammation. In this regard, previous studies have
shown that Klotho suppresses TNF-α-induced expression
of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [18] and proinflammatory cytokines reduce Klotho expression in the
kidney [19, 20, 35]. It remains unclear from the present

study how Klotho suppresses NF-κB activation and the
inflammatory responses. Although extensive studies have
yielded some information regarding signaling pathways
activated by Klotho, no specific receptor for soluble
Klotho has been identified up to date. However, it has
been reported that soluble Klotho could modulate the
PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways [15] and these
pathways are involved in cellular inflammatory responses
to stimuli. Future studies are needed to elucidate the
mechanism by which Klotho suppresses NF-κB-mediated
inflammatory responses.
HSP70 is an inducible heat shock protein and
protects cells and tissue against stress and injury [20, 21,
36]. HSP70 has also been indicated to be a biomarker
of lifespan [37]. We observed that aging hearts have
lower levels of HSP70 which is associated with lower
Klotho levels. When myocardial Klotho levels in aging
hearts are down-regulated by endotoxemia, the levels
of myocardial HSP70 are also further reduced. Further,
treatment of aging endotoxemic mice with recombinant
Klotho prevents the reduction of myocardial HSP70
levels. All of these observations indicate that Klotho
modulates HSP70 levels in the heart. Similarly, Sugiura
and colleagues observed that over-expression of Klotho
in adult mice increases HSP70 levels in the kidney [38].
As HSP70 is cardioprotective [39], it is likely that lower
levels of HSP70 in aging endotoxemic mice contribute
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to the mechanism of cardiac functional injury and that
preservation of myocardial HSP70 levels is one of the
mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of
Klotho. However, the mechanism by which Klotho
modulates HSP70 levels in the aging heart remains unclear
from the present study. It is possible that Klotho is required
to preserve myocardial HSP70 levels, particularly during
endotoxemia. Alternatively, Klotho may up-regulate
HSP70 expression in the heart. Further studies are needed
to address the mechanism.
Nevertheless, intracellular HSP70 appears to
negatively modulate pro-inflammatory signaling. In this
regard, the data generated from the in vitro experiment
show that liposomal delivery of recombinant HSP70
into cultured macrophages elevates cell-associated
HSP70 levels and suppresses NF-κB activation in
response to subsequent endotoxin stimulation. It is
interesting that HSP70 is perinuclear. It is possible
that HSP70 attenuates NF-κB intranuclear localization
by preventing its translocation into the nucleus. Since
recombinant Klotho can preserve myocardial HSP70
levels and suppress myocardial inflammatory responses
characterized by NF-κB activation and inflammatory
cytokine production, it is likely that preservation of
HSP70 levels by Klotho is one of the mechanisms
underlying its effects on inflammation and cardiac
dysfunction in aging endotoxemic mice.

CONCLUSIONS

myocardial inflammatory responses and improves
cardiac function in aging endotoxemic mice. The
anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective mechanism
of Klotho appears to involve HSP70. These novel
findings suggest that Klotho has therapeutic potential
for amelioration of endotoxemic cardiac dysfunction in
aging subjects.

Relative Klotho deficiency is, at least partly,
responsible for the augmented inflammatory responses
and more severe cardiac functional injury in aging
endotoxemic mice. Post-treatment with recombinant
Klotho preserves myocardial HSP70 levels, suppresses

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Additional aging mice were assigned to LPS+saline
group or LPS+Klotho group (n = 6 in each time point).
Normal saline or recombinant Klotho (10 μg/kg, iv) was
administered 30 min after administration of LPS (0.5 mg/
kg, iv). Plasma and myocardial tissue were collected at
24 and 48 h after administration of LPS following LV
function analysis.

Ethics statement
The experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Colorado Denver, and this investigation conforms to
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(National Research Council, revised 1996).

Measurement of cardiac function
Cardiac function was assessed as described
previously [40, 41]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane inhalation (2% isoflurane mixed with pure
oxygen), and anticoagulated with heparin (Elkins-Sinn,
Cherry Hill, NJ; 1,000 units/kg, ip). Animals were laid
supine on a heating blanket and core body temperature
was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C. A pressure-volume
microcatheter (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX; 1 F) was
inserted into the LV through the right common carotid
artery. Pressure-volume loop was recorded using the
MPVS-400 system with the aid of PVAN software (Millar
Instruments, Houston, TX). Heart rate, LV developed
pressure, ejection fraction and cardiac output were
analyzed.

Chemicals and reagents
Antibodies against Klotho, HSP70 and β-actin
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc
(Dallas, TX). Antibodies against NF-κB p65 were
purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc (Beverly, MA).
Recombinant HSP70 (endotoxin-free) was purchased
from Assay Design (Ann Arbor, MI). Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for MCP-1, KC,
TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were purchased from R&D
System (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant Klotho
was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA).
TransAM NF-κB activity (p65 DNA-binding) assay
kit was purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad,
CA). D-MEM/F-12 medium was purchased from
Lonza (Walkersville, MD). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS,
Escherichia coli 0111:B4) and all other chemicals and
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
(St Louis, MO).

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was applied to determine Klotho
protein levels in the myocardium, kidney and liver Klotho,
as well as HSP 70 protein levels in the myocardium.
Proteins in tissue homogenate were separated on gradient
(4%–20%) mini-gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The
membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk solution
for 1 hour at room temperature. The blocked membranes
were incubated with a primary antibody against a protein
of interest overnight in a 4oC cold room. After washing
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with
a peroxidase-linked secondary antibody specific to the
primary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. After
further wash, membranes were treated with enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents. The membranes were
exposed on x-ray films. Image J (Wayne Rasband,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to
analyze band density.

Animals and treatment
Male adult (4 to 6 months) and aging (18 to 20
months) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and National
Institute on Aging (Bethesda, MD, USA), respectively.
Mice were acclimated for 14 days in a 12:12 h light-dark
cycle with free access to water and regular chow diet. The
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado
Denver, and this investigation conforms to the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National
Research Council, revised 1996).
Adult and aging mice were assigned to saline
group (control group) or LPS group (n = 8 in each time
point). All treatments were performed in the morning.
LPS (0.5 mg/kg) was injected through a tail vein.
Control animals were treated with the same volume
of sterile normal saline. Plasma and myocardial tissue
were collected following left ventricle (LV) function
analysis using a pressure-volume microcatheter at
24 and 48 h after administration of LPS or saline. No
mortality was observed in adult endotoxemic mice
or aging endotoxemic mice treated with recombinant
Klotho, but the same endotoxemia protocol resulted in
a 20% mortality in aging mice without treatment with
recombinant Klotho.

ELISA
ELISA kits were utilized to quantify monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), keratinocyte
chemoattractant (KC), TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and
IL-6 levels in plasma and myocardial tissue homogenate.
Klotho levels in myocardial tissue homogenate were also
analyzed using an ELISA kit. Samples and standards
were prepared according to manufacturers’ instructions.
Absorbance of standards and samples was determined

Immunofluorescence staining

spectrophotometrically at 450 nm, using a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA). Results
were plotted against the linear portion of a standard curve.

Dual immunofluorescence staining was performed,
as described previously [43], to localize HSP70 and NFκB p65 in cultured macrophages. After permeabilization
of cell membranes with an ethanol/acetone mixture, cells
on chamber slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
incubated overnight at 4°C with a rat monoclonal
antibody against HSP70 and a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against NF-κB p65. After washing with PBS, cells were
incubated with Cy3-tagged goat antibody against rat
IgG (labeling HSP70 red) and 488-tagged goat antibody
against rabbit IgG (labeling NF-κB p65 green). Nuclei
were stained with bis-benzimide (blue). Microscopy was
performed with a Leica DM 5500 digital microscope
(Leica Microscopy und System GmbH, Wechsler,
Germany).

NF-κB activation assay
NF-κB activity (p65 DNA-binding) was measured
using the TransAM NF-κB assay kit following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Absorbance of samples was
determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm, using a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules,
CA).

Macrophage isolation and treatment
Since primary macrophages have low levels
of HSP70 and display high sensitivity to the proinflammatory effect of LPS, we examined the effect of
liposomal delivery of recombinant HSP70 on macrophage
NF-κB activation.
Macrophages were collected from mouse peritoneal
cavity by lavage as previously described [42]. Briefly, mice
were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital
intravenously. Their peritoneal cavities were flushed with
cold (4oC) serum-free D-MEM/F-12 medium. Medium was
recovered and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,100
rpm, 4oC for 10 minutes (IEC Centra MP4R, International
Equipment Co., Needham Hts, MA). Cells were washed with
serum-free medium and then suspended in full D-MEM/F-12
medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 150 μg/
ml of gentamycin). Cells were plated onto culture dishes or
chamber slides and incubated in an incubator (5% CO2/95%
atmosphere air) at 37oC for 2 hours. Non-adherent cells were
removed by 3 washes with culture medium.
Recombinant HSP70 was delivered to cells using
liposomes. A thin film of lipids (2.0 mg of egg L-αphosphatidylcholine, 0.5 mg of cholesterol, 0.5 mg of
dioleoyl 1, 2-diacyl-3-trimethyl ammonium-propane
and 0.5 mg of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine) was
prepared in a glass tube. HSP70 solution was added to
the dried lipid in the tube, and a suspension of liposomal
HSP70 is prepared by alternating sonication and vortex.
Equal number of cells on 12-well plates were treated with
liposomes containing recombinant HSP70 or liposomes
containing normal saline (vehicle) for 2 hours followed
by a 2-hour period of incubation in the medium without
liposomes. The final concentration of HSP70 in the
medium was 0, 12.5, 25 or 50 μg/ml. A batch of treated
cells was collected for the assessment of cellular HSP70
levels by immunoblotting. Since no difference in cell
density among treatments was observed following this
short period of treatment, the levels of HSP70 were
compared among treatments based on equal cell density.
Other batches of cells were stimulated with LPS (0.2 μg/
ml) for 2 h for examining NFκB intranuclear translocation.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error (SE).
Statistical analysis was performed using StatView
software (Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA, USA).
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher post-hoc test
was used to analyze differences between experimental
groups, and differences were confirmed using the MannWhitney U-test. Statistical significance was defined as
P≤0.05.

KEY MESSAGES
1. Aging hearts have lower Klotho levels, and
endotoxemia further reduces myocardial Klotho levels.
Treatment with recombinant Klotho suppresses myocardial
inflammatory responses and improves cardiac function in
aging endotoxemic mice.
2. Relative Klotho deficiency in the myocardium
of aging endotoxemic mice is associated with downregulation of HSP70 in the heart. Treatment with Klotho
preserves myocardial HSP70 levels.
3. HSP70 is involved in suppression of the
inflammatory response to endotoxin.
