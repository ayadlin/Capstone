Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

ErbB3, a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is a potent activator of
phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and mTOR signaling, driving tumor cell survival and
therapeutic resistance in breast cancers. In luminal breast cancers, ErbB3 upregulation following
treatment with the anti-estrogen fulvestrant enhances PI3K/mTOR-mediated cell survival.
However, the mechanism by which ErbB3 is upregulated in fulvestrant-treated cells is unknown.
We found that ErbB3 protein levels and cell surface presentation were increased following
fulvestrant treatment, focusing our attention on proteins that regulate ErbB3 at the cell surface,
including Nrdp1, NEDD4, and LRIG1. Among these, only LRIG1 correlated positively with ERα,
but inversely with ErbB3 in clinical breast cancer datasets. LRIG1, an estrogen-inducible ErbB
down-regulator, was decreased in a panel of fulvestrant-treated luminal breast cancer cells. Ectopic
LRIG1 expression from an estrogen-independent promoter uncoupled LRIG1 from estrogen
regulation, thus sustaining LRIG1 and maintaining low ErbB3 levels in fulvestrant-treated cells.
An LRIG1 mutant lacking the ErbB3 interaction motif was insufficient to down-regulate ErbB3.
Importantly, LRIG1 overexpression improved fulvestrant-mediated growth inhibition, while cells
expressing the LRIG1 mutant were poorly sensitive to fulvestrant, despite effective ERα downregulation. Consistent with these results, LRIG1 expression correlated positively with increased
disease-free survival in anti-estrogen-treated breast cancer patients. These data suggest that ERαdependent expression of LRIG1 dampens ErbB3 signaling in luminal breast cancer cells, and by
blocking ERα activity with fulvestrant, LRIG1 is decreased thus permitting ErbB3 accumulation,
enhanced ErbB3 signaling to cell survival pathways, and blunting therapeutic response to
fulvestrant.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

ERBB3, the gene encoding the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family member ErbB3,
1
is expressed at relatively high levels in breast cancers that are HER2-amplified , and at even
2
higher levels in Luminal A breast cancers , which often express and are dependent on
estrogen receptor (ER)-α. Nearly 20% of all Luminal breast tumors exhibit ERBB3 gene
copy number gains, causing increased ERBB3 expression, and correlating with decreased
2
disease-free survival . ErbB3 expression is increased further in luminal breast cancers in
response to treatment with the selective ERα modulator (SERM) tamoxifen or the selective
3 5
ERα down-regulator (SERD) fulvestrant – , two drugs clinically prescribed to patients with
luminal breast cancer. Little is known regarding the role of ErbB3 in luminal breast tumors,
largely due to a historical description of ErbB3 as a kinase-impaired heterodimeric partner
167
of EGFR and ErbB2 , , . However, increasing evidence suggest that ErbB3 is a key
therapeutic target in luminal breast cancers.

Author Manuscript

Because ErbB3 harbors six phospho-tyrosine motifs that bind to the p85 regulatory subunit
1 8 11
of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) , – , ErbB3 is a potent activator of PI3K
12
signaling . Once active, PI3K generates PIP3, a potent second messenger that recruits
PI3K pathway effectors to the plasma membrane (e.g., serine-threonine kinases PDK-1 and
Akt), resulting in their activation. Since Akt sits atop a signaling cascade that enhances cell
13
growth and survival , ErbB3 signaling promotes survival of luminal breast cancer cells.
Thus, ErbB3 up-regulation in response to tamoxifen or fulvestrant increases PI3K-Akt
signaling within 24 hours of treatment, increasing tumor cell survival and blunting the
2359
therapeutic benefit of these endocrine inhibitors , , , . However, combination of endocrine
inhibitors with strategies designed to target ErbB3 may be used to circumvent the
compensatory up-regulation of ErbB3-PI3K-Akt signaling, and improve luminal breast
cancer cell killing. The therapeutic ErbB3 antibody U3-1287, for example, significantly
2
impaired PI3K signaling and survival in fulvestrant-treated luminal breast tumor cells .

Author Manuscript

The mechanism(s) contributing to ErbB3 up-regulation in response to fulvestrant are poorly
understood. However, recent findings demonstrated a 2-fold up-regulation of ERBB3
2
transcripts in a panel of luminal breast cancer cells 24 h after fulvestrant treatment . Thus, it
is likely that additional mechanisms of ErbB3 regulation contribute to enhanced ErbB3
protein expression in fulvestrant-treated luminal breast cancer cells. We found that estrogendependent expression of the ErbB family regulatory factor LRIG1 maintains ErbB3
expression at low levels under basal conditions, and that fulvestrant disrupts ERα-dependent
LRIG1 expression, permitting ErbB3 accumulation and survival signaling in fulvestranttreated cells.

Results
The ErbB3 antibody A4 neutralizes fulvestrant-mediated ErbB3 upregulation

Author Manuscript

Previous studies demonstrate that humanized anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody A4 binds the
ErbB3 ectodomain and effectively down-regulates ErbB3 in HER2-amplified breast cancer
14 15
cells through receptor internalization , . However, the utility of A4 in luminal breast
cancers has not yet been described. We tested the impact of A4 on ErbB3 protein levels in
two luminal breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D cells. Western analysis confirmed
ErbB3 expression in serum-starved MCF7 and T47D cells (Fig. 1A), but showed that ErbB3
tyrosine phosphorylation at Y1289 was not detected under these conditions. Recombinant
heregulin α1 (HRG, 2 ng/ml) induced ErbB3 Y1289 phosphorylation in control cells treated
with non-specific human IgG. In contrast, pre-treatment of cells with A4 for 24 h prior to
addition of HRG diminished HRG-induced ErbB3 phosphorylation at Y1289 in MCF7 and
T47D, and decreased total ErbB3 levels.

Author Manuscript

Luminal breast cancer cells use ErbB3 up-regulation in response to ERα targeting to
289
increase tumor cell growth and survival , , . Therefore, we tested the ability of antibody A4
to neutralize ErbB3 up-regulation in luminal breast cancer cells treated with the selective
ERα down-regulator (SERD) fulvestrant. MCF7 and T47D cells were treated for 24 h with
fulvestrant in the presence or absence of A4. As expected, fulvestrant reduced expression of
ERα, while upregulating expression of ErbB3 in control IgG-treated cultures (Fig. 1B),
23
consistent with previous findings , . However, treatment of luminal breast cancer cells with
antibody A4 in combination with fulvestrant neutralized fulvestrant-mediated ErbB3 upregulation. In MCF7 and T47D cells treated with the combination of antibody A4 and
fulvestrant, phosphorylation of Akt and ribosomal protein S6 was down-regulated to a
greater extent that what was seen in cells treated with either agent alone.

Author Manuscript

To determine the impact of A4 on growth of luminal breast cancer cells, we treated 1 X 106
MCF7 and T47D cells with A4 for 3 days in media containing 10% serum. Treatment of
cells with A4 resulted in a modest but significant decrease in cell number after 3 days of
treatment (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous reports using another ErbB3-specific antibody
2
U3-1287 . Treatment of cells with fulvestrant for 3 days decreased cell number. However,
the combination of A4 with fulvestrant reduced cell number to a greater extent than either
fulvestrant or A4 alone, confirming that ErbB3 up-regulation in fulvestrant-treated cells
limits fulvestrant-mediated growth inhibition, and that targeting ErbB3 using the ErbB3
antibody A4 works in combination with fulvestrant to inhibit tumor cell growth through
inhibition of ErbB3 expression. We investigated how ErbB3 targeting with antibody A4
affects the formation of fulvestrant-resistant colonies by seeding MCF7 and T47D cells at
low density. Cells were cultured for 14 days in the presence of fulvestrant (1μM) or DMSO.
Fulvestrant profoundly reduced colony formation in MCF7 and T47D cells (Fig. 1D).
Antibody A4 also decreased colony formation in MCF7 and T47D cells as a single agent.
However, the combination of fulvestrant + A4 caused superior growth inhibition as
compared to fulvestrant alone or A4 alone.

Increased ErbB3 protein correlates with decreased ERα in luminal breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because fulvestrant down-regulates ERα while upregulating ErbB3 protein levels in cultured
luminal breast cancer cell lines, we investigated the inverse relationship between ErbB3 and
ERα in clinical luminal breast cancer specimens curated and analyzed by the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, N = 321). We found high ErbB3 protein levels in 13.1% (42 of 321)
of tumors from the combined Luminal A and Luminal B subgroup as measured by reverse
phase protein array (RPPA, Supp. Fig. S1A). Interestingly, the RPPA score for total ERα
(ESR1) protein was significantly down-regulated in tumors with high ErbB3 protein levels
(Fig. 2A), consistent with the inverse relationship between ERα and ErbB3 protein levels
seen in cultured luminal breast cancer cells. Further, phosphorylation of ERα at S118 (which
16
marks ERα transcriptional activity ) was substantially lower in luminal tumors with high
ErbB3 protein levels (Supp. Fig. S1B). In contrast, ERBB3 transcripts were upregulated in
12% (37/324) luminal breast cancer specimens, but primarily in tumors distinct from those
with ErbB3 protein up-regulation (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that ErbB3 mRNA may not
predict ErbB3 protein levels in tumors. In contrast to the inverse relation observed between
the RPPA scored for ErbB3 and ERα, no relationship was observed between ERα-Ser118
and ERBB3 mRNA levels (Supp. Fig. S1C), while a positive relationship was seen between
ERBB3 mRNA and total ERα protein (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that ErbB3 protein and
ERRB3 mRNA correlate with ERα in distinct ways. This observation is consistent with the
idea that ErbB3 protein expression, but not mRNA expression, is highest when ERα
transcriptional activity is low.

We used avidin-mediated pull-down of biotinylated cell surface proteins followed by
western analysis to determine if ErbB3 levels were upregulated at the cell surface of
fulvestrant-treated MCF7 breast cancer cells. After treatment for 24 hours, ErbB3 pull-down
increased more than 3-fold in fulvestrant treated cells as compared to cells treated with
DMSO (Fig. 2C). ErbB3 was not pulled down by avidin beads in non-biotinylated cells,
demonstrating the specificity of the assay. Thus ErbB3 protein presentation at the cell
surface is upregulated in response to fulvestrant.

Author Manuscript

We further investigated fulvestrant-mediated ErbB3 up-regulation in four fulvestrant-treated
luminal breast cancers cell lines, including lines with PIK3CA-H1047R activating mutations
(T47D), PIK3CA-E545K activating mutations (MCF7 and MDA-MB-361), HER2
overexpression (MDA-MB-361) or with wild-type PIK3CA and HER2 (HCC1428).
Fulvestrant caused ErbB3 up-regulation in each of these cell lines within 24 hours (Fig. 2D).
Using cycloheximide (CHX) to block new protein synthesis, we found that ErbB3 protein
levels decreased at time points following the addition of CHX to DMSO-treated cells, and
were not detected after 120 minutes of CHX (Fig. 2D). In contrast, fulvestrant decreased
ERα expression but increased ErbB3 expression over what was seen in DMSO-treated cells.
In fulvestrant-treated HCC1428, MDA-MB-361 and T47D cells, ErbB3 remained abundant
through 120 minutes after CHX treatment. In fulvestrant-treated MCF7 cells, however,
ErbB3 diminished at a rate similar to what was seen in DMSO-treated cells. However,
because baseline expression of ErbB3 was higher in fulvestrant-treated cells prior adding
CHX, ErbB3 levels were still evident 120 minutes after CHX treatment. Thus, protein
stabilization of ErbB3 may occur in response to fulvestrant in many luminal breast cancer

cells, independently of PIK3CA mutation or HER2 amplification, but other mechanisms
may also lead to ErbB3 protein up-regulation in response to fulvestrant.
LRIG1 decreases expression of ErbB3

Author Manuscript

To understand the molecular events that increase cell surface ErbB3 protein levels in
fulvestrant-treated luminal breast cancer cells, we turned our attention to proteins involved
17
18 19
20
in ErbB3 trafficking and degradation, including LRIG1 , Nrdp1 , , and NEDD4 , which
were over-expressed in 14% (33/235), 9% (22/235), and 8% (19/235) of Luminal A breast
cancers, respectively. RPPA data from TCGA-curated luminal breast cancers did not reveal a
report for total ErbB3 levels in tumors queried for LRIG1 or NRDP1 mRNA up-regulation,
although total ErbB3 RPPA sores were reported upon query for NEDD4 up-regulation,
revealing no association between ErbB3 protein levels and NEDD4 transcript expression
(Supp. Fig. S2). However, the RPPA score for phospho-ErbB3 Y1289, a phospho-tyrosine
induced by treatment of breast cancer cells with HRG (Fig. 1A) or fulvestrant (Fig. 1B), was
reported in queries for LRIG1, Nrdp1, and NEDD4. Although no association was observed
between P-ErbB3 Y1289 RPPA scores and either Nrdp1 or NEDD4, we found a statistically
significant inverse relationship between LRIG1 and P-ErbB3 Y1289 (Fig. 3A). Therefore,
we focused further attention on the relationship between LRIG1 and ErbB3 in luminal breast
cancer cells treated with and without fulvestrant.

We stably expressed a myc-epitope tagged LRIG1 construct in MCF7, HCC1428, and
T47D cells (Fig. 3B). In addition to wild-type (WT) LRIG1, we also expressed a myctagged LRIG1 deletion mutant lacking the large ErbB3 interaction motif in the LRIG1
21
ectodomain (LRIG1ΔEcto) , and an LRIG1 mutant lacking the short regulatory/inhibitory
21
cytoplasmic domain (LRIG1ΔCyto) . Cells were grown in 10% serum, and we assessed cell
lysates by western analysis for ErbB3. We found that LRIG1WT overexpression modestly
decreased ErbB3 protein levels in each cell line as compared to cells expressing the empty
vector pcDNA3, whereas expression of LRIG1ΔEcto, which lacks the ErbB3 interaction
motif, increased ErbB3 protein levels in each cell line tested. In contrast, ErbB3 was
profoundly down-regulated in cells expressing LRIG1ΔCyto, consistent with the reported
increased ErbB-targeting activity of LRIG1ΔCyto.
LRIG1 inhibits growth of luminal breast cancer cells through ErbB3 down-regulation

Author Manuscript

Previous studies demonstrate that LRIG1 suppresses growth of cancer cells – . We used
Kaplan Meier Plotter (kmplot.com) to examine patient survival in datasets of tamoxifentreated ER+ breast cancers (N = 665), bifurcating these tumors into those expressing high or
low levels of LRIG1. The patients in this combined dataset were treated with tamoxifen.
Like fulvestrant, tamoxifen blocks the action of ERα, albeit through a distinct mechanism
which warrants careful consideration in the context of the presented data. However, we used
this publically available meta-analysis tool to identify potentially important information
regarding an association between LRIG1 and response to endocrine-treated breast cancers.
This approach identified a statistically significant decrease in disease-free survival for
patients with tumors expressing lower LRIG1 levels (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of
NRDP1 or NEDD4 did not correlate with disease-free survival of tamoxifen-treated ER+
breast cancer patients (Supp. Fig. S3). These data suggest that LRIG1 expression and

activity promotes a favorable outcome following tamoxifen treatment, and conversely that
lower LRIG1 levels may predict a worse outcome for tamoxifen-treated patients.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To study this more directly, and to determine the role of ErbB3 in LRIG1-mediated growth
inhibition, we measured the impact of exogenous LRIG1 expression in luminal breast cancer
cells. 2.0 X 106 MCF7 and HCC1428 cells stably expressing LRIG1WT, LRIG1ΔEcto, or the
empty expression vector pcDNA3.1 were seeded and cultured with and without the ErbB3
antibody A4 for 3 days. Western analysis confirmed that ErbB3 levels were reduced upon
A4 treatment in cells expressing the empty vector or expressing LRIG1ΔEcto as compared to
these same cells treated with a control IgG (Fig. 4B). Although ErbB3 levels were already
substantially reduced in cells expressing LRIG1WT, ErbB3 protein levels were further
reduced by A4. Cell counting revealed fewer cells in IgG-treated samples expressing
LRIG1WT as compared to cells expressing the empty pcDNA3.1 vector, but increased cells
in cultures expressing LRIG1ΔEcto (Fig. 4C). Cell growth was substantially reduced in
LRIG1ΔEcto cultures treated with antibody A4, suggesting that cells expressing LRIG1ΔEcto
have a growth advantage over cells expressing the empty vector due in large part to
expression of ErbB3. A4 did not further decrease the growth of cells expressing LRIG1WT.
These results were confirmed using siRNA-mediated ErbB3 downregulation. MCF7 cells
expressing LRIG1WT, LRIG1ΔEcto, or the empty vector were transiently transfected with
siRNA against ErbB3. At 24 h after transfection, 1.0 X 105 cells were seeded in 6-well
dishes, and cultured for 3 days in 10% serum, at which time parallel wells were assessed by
western analysis or by cell counting. Western analysis of whole cell lysates confirmed
decreased expression of ErbB3 in cells expressing LRIG1WT, and increased ErbB3 levels in
cells expressing LRIG1ΔEcto as compared to cells harboring the empty vector. Cells
transfected with siRNA sequences directed against ErbB3 demonstrated a reduction in
ErbB3 levels (Fig. 4D). Cell counting revealed that knock-down of Erbb3 reduced the
growth of MCF7 cells expressing LRIG1ΔEcto and MCF7 cells expressing the empty vector
(Fig. 4E). Although cells expressing LRIG1WT displayed reduced growth as compared to
cells expressing empty pcDNA3.1, knockdown of ErbB3 did not decrease growth of these
cells further. These observations are consistent with the idea that the tumor suppressor
LRIG1 decreases growth of luminal breast cancer cells through down-regulation of ErbB3.

Author Manuscript

To understand the consequences of LRIG1 depletion, we used two distinct siRNA sequences
directed against human LRIG1 to knock-down LRIG1 expression. Western analysis
confirmed knockdown of LRIG1 following transient transfection of sequences targeting
LRIG1, but not control siRNA sequences (Fig. 4F). ErbB3 levels were increased in MCF7
and HCC1428 cells upon LRIG1 knock-down, but were reduced in the presence of antibody
A4. To assess the impact of LRIG1 knock-down on growth of luminal breast cancer cells,
we seeded 2.0 X 106 MCF7 and HCC1428 cells 24 hours after siRNA transfection, then
cultured cells for an additional 3 days in 10% serum, with and without antibody A4. Cell
counting after 3 days revealed increased growth of cells transfected with LRIG1 siRNA as
compared to cells transfected with control siRNA sequences (Fig. 4G). Antibody A4
blocked the growth advantage conferred to MCF7 and HCC1428 cells by LRIG1 knockdown. Together, these data suggest that LRIG1 is a key mechanism restraining ErbB3mediated growth in luminal breast cells.

Decreased LRIG1 levels in fulvestrant-treated luminal breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

22

Author Manuscript

Previous reports demonstrate that estrogen-activated ERα transactivates the LRIG1 gene .
Consistent with these findings, Luminal breast cancers with high ERα RPPA scores
displayed significantly higher expression of LRIG1 mRNA (Fig. 5A; N = 235, P = 0.003). In
contrast, ERα RPPA scores did not correlate with Nrdp1 or NEDD4 expression in luminal
breast cancers. These data are consistent with the idea that LRIG1 is an ERα-activated factor
22
in luminal breast cancers . Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ERα down-regulation
in response to fulvestrant causes decreased expression of LRIG1. LRIG1 down-regulation
was seen in MCF7, MDA-MB-361, HCC1428, and T47D cells cultured 24 h with
fulvestrant as compared to LRIG1 levels seen in DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 5B). Although
down-regulation of ERα was nearly complete, LRIG1 down-regulation, as measured by
western analysis, was partial in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells, although LRIG1 was more
substantially down-regulated in T47D and HCC1428 cells. We measured LRIG1 mRNA
levels in MCF7, T47D, HCC1428, and MDA-MB-361 cells cultured 24 h in the presence or
absence of fulvestrant, revealing a substantial reduction in LRIG1 mRNA levels in
fulvestrant-treated cells (Fig. 5C). Further, MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 xenografts from mice
treated with fulvestrant for 7 days (N = 7) expressed a reduced level of LRIG1 transcripts as
compared to control-treated tumors (Fig. 5D). Conversely, MCF7 cells and T47D cells
cultured in 10% charcoal-stripped serum and treated with 20 pM 17β-estradiol for 24 h
upregulated LRIG1 protein levels while concurrently down-regulating ErbB3 protein levels
(Fig. 5E). This suggests that ERα positively regulates LRIG1 transcript levels in luminal
breast cancer cells, although additional mechanisms may contribute to total LRIG1 protein
levels.

Uncoupling LRIG1 from ERα sustains ErbB3 down-regulation in fulvestrant-treated breast
cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine if exogenous expression of LRIG1WT could maintain ErbB3 protein downregulation in fulvestrant-treated cells, we treated MCF7 cells expressing LRIG1WT with
fulvestrant for 24 h. Although LRIG1 levels were decreased in vector-control cells treated
with fulvestrant, MCF7-LRIG1WT cells maintained high LRIG1 expression levels following
fulvestrant treatment (Fig. 6A). Importantly, ErbB3 levels, which were elevated in
fulvestrant-treated MCF7-pcDNA3 cells, remained low in fulvestrant-treated MCF7LRIG1WT cells. We also used biotinylation of cell surface proteins to demonstrate that
fulvestrant-mediated up-regulation of cell surface ErbB3 is blocked in in cells expressing
LRIG1WT as compared to MCF7-pcDNA3 cells (Fig. 6B). Because LRIG1 inhibits growth
of luminal breast cancer cells, and fulvestrant decreases expression of LRIG1, we wanted to
test the hypothesis that LRIG1 down-regulation in response to fulvestrant results in a growth
advantage that partially masks the tumor cell growth inhibition that could be achieved by
fulvestrant. We tested this hypothesis in fulvestrant-treated MCF7 cells. Fulvestrant
decreased the growth of MCF7-pcDNA3 cells over 7 days (Fig. 6C). However, fulvestrantmediated growth inhibition was significantly greater in MCF7-LRIGWT cells and MCF7LRIGΔCyto cells as compared to MCF7-pcDNA3.1 cells. In contrast, MCF7-LRIG1ΔEcto
cells were relatively resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of fulvestrant, indicating that
the ectodomain of LRIG1 is necessary for LRIG1-mediated growth inhibition. These data
suggest that sustained expression of LRIG1 improves the response of luminal breast cancer

cells to fulvestrant, and conversely that loss of ERα-dependent LRIG1 expression weakens
tumor growth inhibition in response to fulvestrant. Western analysis confirmed continued
up-regulation of ErbB3 at 7 days of fulvestrant treatment in MCF7 cells expressing pcDNA3
(Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data suggest that ERα drives expression of the growth
inhibitory protein LRIG1, a protein necessary for ErbB3 down-regulation (Fig. 6C). Upon
loss of ERα and hence loss of LRIG1, ErbB3 levels accumulate at the cell surface,
contributing to growth in fulvestrant treated cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We have shown previously that ErbB3 drives growth and survival of the normal luminal
26
mammary epithelium through MAPK and PI3K pathways, respectively . Similarly, luminal
27
breast cancers also use ErbB3 to increase cell survival in a PI3K-dependent manner ,
23
particularly in fulvestrant-treated cells , , making the combination of therapeutic ErbB3
antibodies with fulvestrant an attractive approach to treat luminal breast cancers.

Author Manuscript

Several reports suggest that genetically enforced ErbB3 overexpression enhances endocrine
23
resistance in luminal breast cancer cells , . More recently, it was shown that ErbB3
upregulation in response to loss of ER activity is not a genetic event acquired over time, but
2
instead is a mechanism inherent to many luminal breast cancer cells . We demonstrate
22,28
herein that ERα-dependent expression of LRIG1
, a cell surface protein involved in
17 25 29
ErbB family RTK trafficking and/or degradation , , , is down-regulated in fulvestranttreated luminal breast cancer cells, allowing ErbB3 to accumulate on the surface of breast
cancer cells (Fig. 2), where it sustains cell growth. These data are consistent with previous
reports demonstrating that estrogen-activated ERα controls expression of LRIG1, such that
estrogen deprivation or ERα targeting reduce expression of LRIG1 in luminal breast cancer
22
cells . These findings explain the relationships shown here between ErbB3 protein (but not
mRNA), ERα protein, and LRIG1 mRNA in luminal breast cancers.

Author Manuscript

Importantly, decreased LRIG1 transcript levels correlated with decreased disease-free
survival in tamoxifen-treated luminal breast cancers (Fig. 5). Because LRIG1 negatively
regulates cell surface levels of ErbB family RTKs, it is possible that increased signaling
through ErbB family RTKs contributes to the worse outcome for those luminal breast tumors
with low LRIG1. The ErbB RTK family is comprised of four members, including epidermal
1 30
growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 , . Although our studies focus on
ErbB3, previous studies demonstrate that enforced over-expression of EGFR, ErbB2, or
certain ErbB4 splice variants increases cell growth and survival in tamoxifen-treated luminal
3 5 8 31
breast cancer cells – , , . While we have not ruled out the potential roles of EGFR, ErbB2,
and ErbB4 in regulating the response of luminal breast tumors to fulvestrant, we found that
antibody-based ErbB3 targeting neutralized ErbB3 up-regulation in fulvestrant-treated cells,
resulting in profound growth inhibition. Blockade of post-therapeutic ErbB3 up-regulation
15 32
by antibody A4 has been reported in Raf/Mek inhibitor-treated melanomas , , and EGFR
33
inhibitor treated non-small cell lung cancers . Moreover, we found that the ErbB3 antibody
blocked cell growth caused by LRIG1 knock-down or dominant-negative LRIG1ΔEcto
expression.

In summary, we have shown herein that the ERα-regulated gene LRIG1 suppresses cell
surface ErbB3 expression and signaling in luminal breast cancers, such that ErbB3 rapidly
accumulates on the cell membrane following treatment with fulvestrant. Previous studies
demonstrate the profound impact of ErbB3 up-regulation on PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in
23
fulvestrant-treated breast cancers , . Although mTOR inhibitors are approved in
combination with endocrine therapy to prevent the consequences of this feedback
34
inhibition , mTOR inhibitors are often poorly tolerated. Because ErbB3-targeting
antibodies block resurgent signaling through the PI3K-Akt pathway in fulvestrant-treated
2
cells , these data suggest that ErbB3 antibodies might be a therapeutic alternative for use in
combination with endocrine inhibitors.

(Atlanta Biologics) except where indicated as serum-free. Fulvestrant (1 μM) (SigmaAldrich) and Heregulin-1β epidermal growth factor-like domain (2 ng/ml, R&D Systems),
14 15
and the humanized ErbB3 monoclonal antibody A4 , were used where indicated. Colony
assays were seeded in 6-well dishes (105 cells/dish), and cultured 14d in DMEM/10% FBS.
Cells were fixed in formalin, stained with crystal violet, imaged on a flatbed scanner,
converted to binary images, and quantified using Image J software. Cells (1 X 105) were
transfected using Xfect Reagent (Clontech) according to manufacturer’s directions with 2 μg
plasmid DNA: pcDNA3.1 (Life Technologies/InVitrogen), pcDNA3.1-LRIG1, pcDNA3.121 22
LRIG1-ΔEcto, and pcDNA3.1-LRIG1-ΔCyto , . LRIG1 siRNA and non-specific siRNA
sequences were purchased (Dharmacon) and used for transfection of cells with Dharmafect
(Dharmacon) according to manufacturer’s directions.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaF, 120 mM
NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. 1 mg lysates
were used for immunorecipitation (IP) with ErbB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, C-17) or
9E10 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:200 (v/v) for 2 h, then pulled down with Protein A/G+ agarose
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) at 1:20. IPs or cell lyates (20 μg) were denatured in reducing
sample buffer, resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex, Life Technologies), and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (iBlot, Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked and
26
probed with antibody as previously described using the following antibodies: ErbB3
(C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000); Y1289 P-ErbB3 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000); 9E10
(Sigma-Aldrich; 1:2000); LRIG1 (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:500), α-actin (Sigma-Aldrich;
1:20,000).
Biotinylation of cell surface proteins
Cells were cultured to 80–90% confluence, then incubated 30 min at 4°C with EZ-Link

Author Manuscript

The Cancer Genome Atlas Invasive Breast Cancer dataset was clustered according to
PAM50 subtypes and corresponding data on ERBB3, LRIG1, NEDD4, and NRDP1 mRNA,
patient survival, and ErbB3, ErbB3 PY1289, ESR1, and ESR1 P-S118 were analyzed using
36
publically available software on the cBio Portal website . Meta-analysis of expression
array datasets of tamoxifen-treated Luminal A breast cancers were assessed for correlations
between disease-free survival and expression of LRIG1 (211596_s_at), NRDP1
(201961_s_at), and NEDD4 (213012_at) using KmPlotter (KmPlot.com).
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Using RNeasy (Qiagen), total RNA was harvested from cell lysates passed through a
QiaShredder column (Qiagen) or from flash-frozen tumors homogenized using a tissue lyser.
Total RNA was quantified and 2 ug RNA was used to synthesize cDNA (High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription kit - Applied Biosystems). Quantitative RT PCR was
performed on a BioRad iCycler iQ5 machine using the following primer sequences:
Human LRIG1 F: 5′-TAA CTC GAG AAC CCA CTG CTT ACT- 3′
Human LRIG1 R: 5′-CTA GAA GGC ACA CTC GAG GCT GAT- 3′

Xenograft experiments
Estrogen pellets (14 d extended release, 0.17 mg β estradiol, Innovative Research of
America) were implanted subcutaneouly into 3–4 week old female Balb/C athymic nude
mice (Jackson Laboratories). Right and left inguinal mammary fatpads were injected with
106 MCF7 or MDA-MB-361 in 100 μl growth factor reduced Matrigel. Tumors were
measured with calipers twice weekly. Tumor-bearing mice were randomized into treatment
arms to receive fulvestrant (Novartis) delivered once weekly by intramuscular injection. All
animal experimentation was performed in AAALAC approved facilities at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. All animal use protocols were reviewed and approved prior to
experimentation by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN.
