Abstract
Resistance to anti-ErbB2 agents is a significant problem in the treatment of human ErbB2+ breast cancers.
We show here that adhesion of human ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to basement membrane laminin-5 provides
substantial resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib, agents that respectively target the extracellular and kinase domains of ErbB2. Knockdown of laminin-binding integrins (α6β4, α3β1) or associated tetraspanin protein CD151 reversed laminin-5 resistance and sensitized ErbB2+ cells to trastuzumab and lapatinib. CD151
knockdown, together with trastuzumab treatment, inhibited ErbB2 activation and downstream signaling
through Akt, Erk1/2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Hence, ErbB2 function in mammary tumor cells is promoted by integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-5, with strong support by CD151, leading to signaling
through FAK. Consequently, removal or inhibition of any of these components (laminin-5, integrin, CD151,
FAK) markedly sensitizes cells to anti-ErbB2 agents. These new insights should be useful when devising strategies for overcoming drug resistance in ErbB2+ cancers. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2256–63. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
ErbB2/HER2, an epidermal growth factor receptor family
member, is a potent oncogenic receptor kinase driving progression, malignancy, and metastasis of human breast cancer.
ErbB2 activates via homodimerization or heterodimerization
with other ErbB family members (1). Activated ErbB2 initiates
signals through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Ras/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and other pathways, thus enhancing cell proliferation and survival (2). ErbB2
gene amplification, which occurs in 15% to 25% of human
breast cancers, is associated with poor patient prognosis
and survival (3). ErbB2 inhibitors trastuzumab and lapatinib
are clinically effective in targeting ErbB2+ breast cancers.
Trastuzumab (herceptin), a HER2-specific humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibits ErbB2 signaling and triggers an antitumor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

response (4). As a single agent, trastuzumab elicits objective
tumor responses in 30% of patients with advanced ErbB2+
breast cancer and improves response rate and survival when
added to chemotherapy in that patient population (5). Lapatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of ErbB2 and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activities, induces apoptosis in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells, including those that are trastuzumab resistant (6). Consistent with
this finding, lapatinib improves response rates and progressionfree survival when added to chemotherapy in patients with
ErbB2+ breast cancer who had previously progressed on trastuzumab (7).
Unfortunately, >60% patients with ErbB2+ cancers do not
respond to trastuzumab monotherapy, and most initial responders develop resistance within 1 year (8). Resistance
may arise through constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway, other ErbB family members, or alternative oncogenic pathways (4). Also, membrane-associated glycoprotein
MUC4 might cause resistance by masking the ErbB2-binding
site for trastuzumab (4). Potential mechanisms of lapatinib
resistance include ErbB2 kinase site mutations (9), PI3K/
Akt pathway hyperactivation, and increased antiapoptotic
to proapoptotic protein ratio (10).
Tumor-microenvironment interactions markedly affect
antitumor drug responses. For example, ECM proteins, including laminin-5, protect malignant mammary cells (11)
and other cancer cells (12) from chemically induced apoptosis. In nearly all epithelial tissues, laminin-5 regulates cell organization, gene expression, and survival (13). Although
laminin-5 levels diminish upon malignant transformation of
breast epithelium (14), it still can support mammary tumor
survival (15) and tumor metastasis to lung (16), lymph node
(17), and likely other tissues.

CD151 and α6 Integrins in Breast Cancer

Integrins, at the tumor-ECM microenvironment interface,
can promote tumor cell survival and protection from chemically induced apoptosis (18). The laminin-binding integrin
α6β4 promotes breast tumor survival (11, 15). Furthermore,
deletion of the β4 signaling domain sensitized ErbB2+ mouse
mammary tumors to gefitinib/iressa (19), a tyrosine kinase
domain inhibitor. Survival promotion by α6β4 sometimes
may (20) or may not (21) involve activation of Akt, a key determinant of drug resistance (4). Laminin-binding integrins
(α3β1, α6β1, α6β4) associate closely with CD151, a tetraspanin family member (22). CD151 minimally affects integrindependent cell adhesion to laminin but rather influences
adhesion strengthening, cell invasion, and migration and
three-dimensional cell morphology (22). CD151 expression
correlates with poor prognosis in colon (23) and non–small
cell lung cancers (24) and with invasiveness in mammary carcinoma cells (25). Ablation of CD151 protein affects tumor
cell growth, invasion, migration, and EGF sensitivity in
human basal-like breast cancer (26). Because α6β4 affects
ErbB2+ breast tumor progression (19) and CD151 is elevated
in 32% of ErbB2+ human tumors (26), we hypothesized that
CD151 and/or α6β4 might influence sensitivity to ErbB2targeted therapies.
Integrin-mediated cell adhesion typically results in integrins localizing into focal adhesion complexes, along with
many cystoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules including focal adhesion kinase (FAK; ref. 27). Integrin-mediated
adhesion stimulates FAK activity (28), and in breast cancer
FAK may control tumor initiation, proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis (29). However, α6β4 does not localize
into focal adhesions (30) and does not typically activate FAK
(31). Tetraspanin CD151 also does not localize into focal adhesions (32), and CD151 ablation/expression may (26) or may
not (33) affect FAK activation. Hence, it was unclear whether
FAK would play a role in ErbB2 drug resistance, involving
CD151 and laminin-binding integrins.
Here we show that trastuzumab and lapatinib resistance
develops when ErbB2+ breast cancer cells use CD151-α6β4
(and α3β1) complexes to engage laminin-5 and activate
FAK. Conversely, removal or inhibition of laminin-5, integrins,
CD151, or FAK markedly enhances sensitivity to ErbB2targeted drugs. These results are notable because (a) neither
CD151 nor other tetraspanins had been linked to tumor drug
resistance and (b) CD151 targeting could enhance drug sensitivity without radical disruption of laminin-binding integrins.

Materials and Methods
Cells and antibodies. All ErbB2+ human mammary tumor
cell lines BT474, ZR-75-1, SKBR3, and MD-MB-453 cells, from
American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Monoclonal antibodies to CD151 (5C11), CD9 (MM2/57), CD81 (M38),
integrin α2 (IIE10), α5 (BIIG2), α3 (A3-X8), α6 (A6-ELE), and
β1 (TS2/16) were referenced elsewhere (26). Monoclonal
antibodies against α6 (GoH3) and β4 integrins and against
FAK were obtained from BD Bioscience. Antibodies against

www.aacrjournals.org

E-cadherin and phosphorylated FAK (Y397) were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Claudin 3–specific antibody was
from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total
and phosphorylated PTEN, MAPK, AKT, ErbB2, and EGFR
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti–β-actin
was from Sigma.
siRNA and shRNA targeting. For siRNA targeting, cells
(∼2–4 × 105 per well in six-well plates) were preincubated
with siRNAs using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), at days −3 and
−1 before assay. Before drug addition, siRNA-treated cells
were essentially indistinguishable with respect to physical
appearance and viability. All siRNAs were purchased from
Dharmacon. Sequences of siRNAs targeting CD151, α6, α3,
and CD9 were described (26). Independent siRNAs for FAK
are UAGUACAGCUCUUGCAUAU and GGACAUUAUUGGCCACUGU. PTEN was targeted using four oligo pools (GAUCAGCAUACACAAAUUA, GACUUAGACUUGACCUAUA,
GAUCUUGACCAAUGGCUAA, CGAUAGCAUUUGCAGUAUA). For stable knockdown of human CD151, ErbB2+
breast cancer cells were infected with lentivirus as described
(26). CD151-null cells were negatively selected by a two-color
flow cytometry. Knockdown efficiency was evaluated by flow
cytometry and immunoblotting.
Drug sensitivity assays. Matrix proteins collagen, fibronectin, and Matrigel were from BD Bioscience. Laminin-5
was from human A431 cells. Plates (24-well) were precoated
with ∼5 μg/mL laminin-5 or Matrigel (overnight at 4°C) or
with 20 μg/mL collagen I or 10 μg/mL fibronectin (1 h at
7°C) or left uncoated. Cells (∼5 × 105 per well) were plated
for 24 h and then treated with trastuzumab (0–512 μg/mL) or
lapatinib (0–500 nmol/L). After another 48 to 72 h, cells were
quantitated using PicoGreen (Invitrogen). Each data point represents the mean of three separate experiments, each with
triplicate measurements. Variability between experiments
was typically <15%. Trastuzumab (herceptin) was from Genentech, lapatinib was from commercial sources and antiFAK inhibitor TAE226 was from Novartis Co. Seven different
ErbB2-negative cell lines showed no drug sensitivity, except
at the highest doses of trastuzumab (256–512 μg/mL yielded
mean decrease in cell number of 2–3%) and lapatinib (2.5–
10 μmol/L yielded a mean decrease in cell number of 3–10%).
Signaling assays. Control and CD151-deficient BT474 or
ZR75 cells were detached using EDTA, washed, incubated at
37°C for 30 min, and then plated on laminin-5 ± trastuzumab.
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1%
Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS and protease
cocktail (Roche). After reducing electrophoresis, proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted for phosphorylated ErbB2 (Y1221/1222), Akt (S473), MAPK (T202/Y204, PTEN
(T382/383) and FAK (Y397) and for total ErbB2, MAPK, Akt,
PTEN, and FAK proteins.

Results
Laminin-5, α3β1 and α6β4 integrins, and CD151 affect
ErbB2 drug sensitivity. We hypothesized that laminin-5, a
key epithelial cell microenvironment component (31), might

affect sensitivity to ErbB2-targeted drugs. Indeed, four different ErbB2-positive mammary cell lines (SKBR3, BT474,
MDA-MB-231, ZR75) were markedly more resistant to trastuzumab when grown on laminin-5, compared with fibronectin, collagen, noncoated plastic (Fig. 1A), or Matrigel
(Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest that drug resistance is supported by receptors for laminin-5 (integrins
α6β4 and/or α3β1) but not by receptors for collagen
(α2β1), fibronectin (α5β1), or Matrigel (α6β1). These integrins are variably present in the ErbB2+ cells (Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3B). Consistent with the laminin-5 results, simultaneous ablation of integrin α3 and α6 subunits (by 78–
95%; Supplementary Figs. S3A, B) markedly sensitized ZR75
cells to trastuzumab (Fig. 1B), as the IC50 decreased by a factor of ∼16 (∼12.1–0.76 μg/mL). By contrast, for ZR75 cells on
noncoated plastic, the IC50 decreased by a factor of only ∼4.5
(4.9–1.1 μg/mL; Fig. 1B).

Figure 1. Laminin-5 promotes trastuzumab resistance. A, semiconfluent
human ErbB2+ breast cancer cells were plated on indicated ECM proteins
or on noncoated (NC) plastic. After treatment with trastuzumab for 3 d,
cell numbers were assessed. B, ZR75 cells were transfected with siRNAs,
plated on noncoated plastic or on laminin-5, and treated with trastuzumab
for 3 d, and then cell numbers were assessed. Efficiency of α3 and α6
knockdown was evaluated by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S3A)
and/or by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S3B).

The α3 and α6 integrins associate closely with tetraspanin
CD151 whenever it is coexpressed. As an alternative to ablating α3 and α6 integrins, which disrupts adhesion to laminin5, we stably knocked down CD151 (by >90%; Supplementary
Fig. S3C), which minimally affects cell adhesion. Nonetheless,
stable CD151 knockdown markedly enhanced trastuzumab
sensitivity of SKBR3, BT474, MDA-MB-453, and ZR75 cells
on laminin-5 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, CD151 knockdown minimally affected sensitivity for cells on noncoated tissue culture
plastic (Fig. 2A), Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. S1) or collagen
(Supplementary Fig. S1). For representative ZR75 cells on
laminin-5, trastuzumab sensitivity was enhanced similarly
by siRNA knockdown of either CD151 or α6 integrin (IC50,
6–8 to 0.9–1.0 μg/mL; Fig. 2B). Knockdown of α3 integrin
increased trastuzumab sensitivity to a lesser extent (IC50,
2.5 μg/mL; Fig. 2B). Knockdown of CD151 did not affect surface
levels of α3, α6, β1, or β4 integrins (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
We also tested breast cancer cell sensitivity to lapatinib, a
membrane permeable ErbB2 kinase inhibitor (34). Again,
control IC50s (120–190 nmol/L) were markedly diminished
upon knockdown of α6 or CD151 (9–11 nmol/L), α3 (∼16
nmol/L), or both integrin subunits together (∼8 nmol/L) in
ZR75 cells plated on laminin 5 (Fig. 3A). Knockdown of
tetraspanin protein CD9 had negligible effect (IC50, ∼150
nmol/L; Fig. 3A). In BT474 cells, CD151 knockdown (by
>90%; Supplementary Fig. S4) again had more effect for cells
on laminin-5 (IC50, decreased from ∼14 to 2 nmol/L) compared with tissue culture plastic (6.5–3.5 nmol/L; Fig. 3B).
ErbB2 and CD151 signaling. CD151 ablation did not affect ErbB2 oligomerization in BT474 cells, as seen by chemical cross-linking (Supplementary Fig. S5). For BT474 cells on
laminin-5 in the presence of 1% serum, ErbB2 phosphorylation was reduced upon adding trastuzumab (by ∼32%) or ablation of CD151 (by ∼46%), whereas both together had a
roughly additive effect (∼85% reduction; Fig. 4A). Trastuzumab treatment and CD151 ablation similarly diminished
AKT phosphorylation in an additive manner (trastuzumab
by 59%; CD151 by 42%; both by 91%; Fig. 4B). For Erk1/2, another signaling molecule downstream of ErbB2, inhibition
was synergistic. Erk1/2 phosphorylation was diminished by
trastuzumab (45%) and CD151 ablation (10%), with both together yielding 88% reduction (Fig. 4C). Interference with
PTEN, an upstream phosphatase that suppresses PI3K and
AKT, can enhance trastuzumab resistance (35). However, for
BT474 cells already resistant due to plating on laminin-5,
knockdown of PTEN yielded little or no further increase in resistance to trastuzumab or lapatinib (Supplemenatry Fig. S6).
Furthermore, trastuzumab treatment and/or CD151 ablation
minimally affected phosphorylation of PTEN at S380 (Fig. 4D).
A central role for FAK. For BT474 cells on laminin-5, FAK
activation (Y397 phosphorylation) was slightly diminished by
trastuzumab treatment (12%), and CD151 knockdown had a
modest effect (43% reduction; Fig. 4E). However, both together reduced FAK activation by 83% (Fig. 4E). Consistent
with ErbB2 signaling through FAK, knockdown of FAK
(>90%; Fig. 5C) markedly increased trastuzumab sensitivity
of BT474 cells on laminin-5 (IC50, ∼210 to 13–16 μg/mL;
Fig. 5A). Knockdown of CD151 or FAK, alone or together,

tivity of BT474 (Fig. 6A) and SKBR3 (Fig. 6B), as IC50s shifted
downwards by a factor of ∼4 to 7. FAK ablation (by siRNA)
and inhibition (by TAE226) yielded similar sensitization to
trastuzumab. Hence, the secondary ability of TAE226 to inhibit insulin-like growth factor-1R (38) seems not to be a factor in these experiments.

Discussion
Targeting of ErbB2 by trastuzumab (extracellularly) and by
lapatinib (intracellularly) can effectively inhibit ErbB2+ breast
cancer. Removal, replacement, or inhibition of laminin-5, integrin α6β4 (or α3β1), CD151, or FAK sensitized cells to trastuzumab and lapatinib and diminished ErbB2 signaling.
Hence, there is a functional collaboration between ErbB2
and laminin-5-integrin-CD151 complexes, with FAK playing
a key downstream role. Our cells were sensitized to respond
to trastuzumab at doses (∼4–128 μg/mL) comparable with
steady-state levels (∼80 μg/mL) obtained in human patients.

Figure 2. Ablation of CD151 restores trastuzumab sensitivity to cells on
laminin-5. A, human ErbB2+ cells stably expressing control or
CD151-specific shRNAs were plated on laminin-5 (LN5) or noncoated
(NC) plastic. Note that in each panel, the two control curves (without
CD151 knockdown) are the same as those shown in Fig. 1A and are
included again here to allow comparison of CD151 knockdown effects. B,
ZR75 cells were transfected with two rounds of the indicated siRNAs and
then plated on laminin-5. All cells were then treated with trastuzumab
for 3 d, and viability was assessed using PICOGreen. Efficiency of CD151,
α3, and α6 knockdowns was evaluated as in Supplementary Figs. S3A
and S3B.

similarly enhanced trastuzumab sensitivity (Fig. 5A). By contrast, BT474 cells on tissue culture plastic did not show resistance to trastuzumab and were relatively unaffected by FAK
knockdown (Fig. 5B). Hence, laminin-5 and CD151 may promote trastuzumab resistance entirely by acting through FAK.
A small molecule inhibitor of FAK, TAE226, inhibits
multiple tumor cell types (36, 37). Titration of TAE226 up
to 1.0 μmol/L caused only a slight (27–29%) inhibition of
BT474, SKBR3, ZR75, and MDA-MB-453 cell growth during
a 48-h assay (not shown). However when combined with trastuzumab, the effects of TAE226 were more dramatic. At 0.5 to
1.0 μmol/L, TAE226 markedly increased trastuzumab sensi-

Figure 4. Trastuzumab and
CD151 effects on signaling.
BT474 cells expressing control or
CD151-shRNAs were plated on
laminin-5 (in 1% FBS, ±10 μg/mL
trastuzumab for 20 h), lysed, and
blotted for indicated molecules.
Protein density ratios were
determined (phosphorylated/total)
and normalized relative to control
conditions (lane 1, 1.0).

The tumor microenvironment can dramatically affect drug
sensitivity (39), and integrin-dependent adhesion generally
supports tumor cell drug resistance (40). Indeed, plating on
laminin-5 enhanced ErbB2+ breast cancer cell resistance to
trastuzumab and lapatinib. However, ErbB2+ cell resistance
was not enhanced by collagen I, Matrigel, fibronectin, or noncoated plastic. There are few reports of “matrix-specific” drug
resistance. Adhesion to laminin-1 promoted small cell lung
cancer drug resistance (41), contrasting with our results, in
which Matrigel/laminin-1 was not protective. Elsewhere,
laminin-5, but not other ECM proteins, was modestly protective when added to already adherent hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with Iressa/gefitinib (42), an EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor. Ours may be the first study to show a specific protective effect for laminin-5 adhesion on tumor cell
drug resistance in general and drugs targeting ErbB2 in particular. Although laminin-5 (laminin 332) may be lost as
breast cancers become malignant (14), it has been suggested
that laminin-5 present in normal breast tissue may support
the initial transition to invasive cancer (43). In addition,
laminin-5 can appear at the invasive front in some breast
carcinomas (44), and its appearance may correlate with
decreased breast cancer patient survival (45).
Whereas this study focused on laminin-5, the results are
relevant to other laminins. For example, laminin-10 (laminin 511), which contributes to breast cancer progression
(46) and is elevated in ∼35% of ErbB2+ human breast can-

2260

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

cer samples, also supports trastuzumab resistance (not
shown). Other notable similarities between laminin 10 and
laminin 5 include (a) recognition by integrins α3β1 and
α6β4, (b) regulatory involvement of CD151, and (c) signaling through FAK (47).
Consistent with the role of laminin-5, major laminin receptors (integrins α6β4 and α3β1) also contribute to trastuzumab resistance. In a prior study, the β4 integrin cytoplasmic
tail enhanced murine HER2/ErbB2+ cell resistance to gefitinib (19). However our results point not only to α6β4 but also
α3β1, acting together with laminin-5 and tetraspanin CD151
to enhance ErbB2+ cell resistance to both extracellular (trastuzumab) and intracellular (lapatinib) agents. Matrigel, containing laminin-1, did not support drug resistance, most
likely because its receptor (α6β1) was minimally present
on our ErbB2+ cells.
Ablation of CD151 (but not tetraspanin CD9) was nearly as
effective as α6 and α3 ablation, with respect to drug sensitization. Removal of CD151 does not affect cell surface integrin
levels and minimally affects cell adhesion to laminin. Although we did not obtain evidence for a direct association
between ErbB2, integrins, and/or FAK, we suspect that the
presence or absence of CD151 may nonetheless affect drug
resistance by influencing the distributions of ErbB2, laminin-binding integrins, and/or FAK relative to one another.
In this regard, CD151 does indeed affect the distribution of
laminin-binding integrins (26). Furthermore, CD151 recruits

trastuzumab resistance in vitro is likely to be also relevant
in vivo.
Although others suggested direct association between
ErbB2 and laminin-binding integrins (48, 49), we failed to
coimmunoprecipitate ErbB2 with α3β1 or α6β4, either in
the presence or absence of CD151. Elsewhere, we showed
that CD151 supports α6 integrin–dependent functions and
promotes EGFR efficiency in human basal-like breast cancer
cells (26). We suspect that support of ErbB2 and EGFR functions by laminin-5-integrin-CD151 complexes will be mechanistically similar.
FAK plays a key role in breast cancer initiation and progression (29) but was not known to affect resistance to ErbB2
(or EGFR) targeting agents. Here we show that FAK plays a
key role downstream of both CD151-integrin complexes and
ErbB2.
CD151 ablation plus ErbB2 inhibition synergized to prevent FAK activation, suggesting that both independently activate the same FAK. CD151 ablation plus ErbB2 inhibition
also synergized to prevent activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2, a key regulator of cell proliferation,
downstream of FAK. Furthermore, FAK and CD151 knockdowns yielded similar trastuzumab sensitization (without
additive effects), and drug sensitization was seen on laminin-5, but not on other substrates. Hence, drug resistance
promoted by CD151-integrin-laminin complexes seems to
be entirely FAK dependent. Although ablation of FAK can
sensitize cells to various other anticancer agents (36, 50),
we provide the first evidence for sensitization to ErbB2targeting agents. Although others saw activated FAK physically associate with ErbB2 and α6β4, but not with α3β1
(48), we did not see FAK coimmunoprecipitation with either
α6β4 or α3β1.
The AKT kinase cascade typically regulates drug-resistant
cancer cell survival (35). For cells on laminin-5, trastuzumab
treatment or CD151 ablation each partly diminished AKT activation, consistent with diminished cell survival. Activation

laminin-binding integrins into tetraspanin-enriched
microdomains containing a variety of tetraspanins and other
proteins (22). Through one or more of these proteins, CD151integrin complexes could indirectly affect ErbB2 functional
efficiency. Indeed, CD151 ablation did partly diminish ErbB2
phosphorylation in cells on laminin-5. Consistent with CD151
support of ErbB2 functional efficiency (and therefore drug resistance), mice lacking CD151 showed a marked delay in the
spontaneous appearance of ErbB2-driven mammary tumors.5
Hence, the integrin-CD151-ErbB2 collaboration supporting

Figure 6. Inhibition of FAK affects trastuzumab sensitivity. BT474 (A)
and SKBR3 (B) cells were plated on laminin-5 and then treated with
trastuzumab, together with the FAK inhibitor TAE226 at the indicated
concentrations.

of PTEN, a phosphatase that suppresses the AKT pathway,
can enhance trastuzumab sensitivity, whereas PTEN loss is
associated with resistance (35). However, for ErbB2+ cells
on laminin-5, PTEN ablation minimally affected trastuzumab resistance. Also, neither trastuzumab nor CD151 ablation activated PTEN, despite increasing trastuzumab
sensitivity. Hence, the role of PTEN is minimized for cells
on laminin-5.
Inhibition of laminin-5, α3β1, α6β4, CD151, or FAK should
enhance breast cancer sensitivity to drugs targeting ErbB2.
Indeed, we show that an inhibitor of FAK (TAE226) can
enhance trastuzumab sensitivity. Elsewhere, the same FAK
inhibitor reduced cell survival in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells (36) and enhanced ovarian
cancer inhibition by the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel
(50). Our new insights into CD151 effects on drug sensitivity
add to the emergence of CD151 and other tetraspanins as
potential targets in cancer, infectious disease, and other
pathologies (51). Targeting of CD151 offers potential advantages. First, it should provide drug sensitization while minimally disrupting vital integrin-mediated cell adhesion and

signaling processes. Second, it affects functions of multiple
laminin-binding integrins at once. Third, it could affect other
growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, which may be supported by CD151 (26). In conclusion, we have identified novel
regulators of ErbB2 drug sensitivity, which may provide a
new approach to sensitizing cells to drugs targeting ErbB2
and possibly other receptor tyrosine kinases.
