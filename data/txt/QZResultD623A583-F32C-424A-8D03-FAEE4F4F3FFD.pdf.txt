Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Understanding the biology that underlies histologically similar but molecularly distinct subgroups
of cancer has proven difficult since their defining genetic alterations are often numerous, and the
cellular origins of most cancers remain unknown1–3. We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by
integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease
models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumor that arises
throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup specific alterations included
amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select
cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the
transcriptomes of human tumors to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from
different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf
locus. The transcriptome of human cerebral ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted
INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs. Remarkably, activation
of Ephb2 signaling in these, but not other NSCs, generated the first mouse model of ependymoma,
which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup
of human cerebral tumor. Further comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumors
revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control
synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this
ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to
meticulously match subgroup specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and
interrogate cancer subgroups.
Ependymomas are tumors of the brain and spinal cord4. Surgery and irradiation remains the
mainstay of treatment of this disease since chemotherapy is ineffective in most patients.
Consequently, ependymoma is incurable in up to 40% of cases5. Despite histologic
similarities, ependymomas from different regions of the CNS display disparate prognoses,
transcriptional profiles and genetic alterations6–8, suggesting they are different diseases and
confounding efforts to study, model and treat these tumors.

Author Manuscript

To understand the biological basis of ependymoma heterogeneity, we catalogued DNA copy
number alterations (CNAs) among 204 tumor samples and generated messenger (m)RNA
and micro (mi)RNA expression profiles for 83 and 64 of these tumors, respectively
(Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Table 1). mRNA profiles segregated tumors by CNS
location and unmasked previously unknown subgroups among supratentorial, posterior fossa
and spinal ependymomas (Subgroups A to I, Figure 1). Notably, miRNAs segregated tumors
by location and subgroup in a manner that significantly matched that of mRNA profiles
(Rand index for mRNA subgroup match=0.88, P<0.0001;Supplemental Figure 2). Large

chromosomal CNAs occurred most frequently in spinal tumors, enriching their mRNA
expression signature for genes gained and over-expressed on chromosomes 4, 7, 9, 12, 15q
and 18q and deleted and under-expressed on 22q (permutation analysis of each, P<0.005;
Supplemental Figures 3 and 4; Supplemental Table 2a). Similarly, deletion and underexpression of chromosomes 3, 9 and 22q enriched the expression signature of subgroup C,
while deletion and under-expression of 6q was observed in subgroup H (Supplemental
Figure 4). The observation that mRNA, miRNA and CNA profiles cluster ependymomas
into similar subgroups supports the notion that these subgroups are true biologic entities.

Author Manuscript

In addition to large chromosomal alterations we identified 175 focal amplifications (average
size 159kb) and 157 focal deletions (average size 199kb) encoding 1,236 and 1,209
transcripts, respectively (see Supplemental Methods section, Supplemental Table 3 and
Supplemental Gene Cards). In contrast to large alterations, focal CNAs occurred most
frequently in supratentorial ependymomas (Supplemental Table 2b). Alignment of each
focal CNA against the database of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) revealed which
overlapped with known CNVs (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/), but these were not
excluded from further analysis since recent data suggests CNVs might contribute to disease
states including cancer9. Fifty-one of 57 selected CNAs that were likely to encode
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) were validated by Real-Time PCR and/or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Figure 1; Supplemental Table 4; Supplemental
Gene Cards; see Supplemental Methods for selection criteria). This extensive analysis
confirmed and refined previously reported CNAs (e.g., deletion of INK4A/ARF7,
amplification of NOTCH18, and three discrete focal 22q deletions), and identified 28 and 23
novel recurrent focal amplifications and deletions, respectively.

To prioritize for further study genes within focal CNAs that may have driven clonal
selection, we correlated DNA copy number with the level of transcripts encoded by each
affected loci (Supplemental Gene Cards). Seventeen percent (n=107/632) of genes located
within 28 validated focal amplicons displayed evidence of copy number driven expression,
highlighting them as potential ependymoma oncogenes (Supplemental Table 5a). Notably,
these included several regulators of stem cell proliferation, pluripotency and neural
differentiation e.g., THAP1110, PSPH11, EPHB212, ten genes within the PCDH cluster13,
KCNN114, RAB3A15,16, PTPRN217 and NOTCH118, the latter being the only candidate
ependymoma oncogene identified to date8. Eighteen-percent (n=130/728) of genes located
within 23 validated focal deletions displayed copy number driven decreased expression
compatible with these being TSGs (Supplemental Table 5b and Supplemental Gene Cards).
These included established TSGs previously implicated in ependymoma7 e.g., PTEN,
CDKN2A/CDKN2B, as well as genes with no prior known role in cancer (e.g., STAG1
[3q22.3] and TNRC6B [22q13.1]). Since the few known candidate ependymoma oncogenes
and TSGs were identified by our comprehensive bioinformatics, we suggest that the other
genes identified here are highly enriched for those involved in ependymoma tumorigenesis.
Recently, we showed that intracranial and spinal ependymomas are propagated by radial glia
(RG)-like cancer stem cells7. RG function as NSCs in the embryo and give rise to adult
NSCs19,20. Throughout development NSCs located in the different regions of the CNS
display intrinsic biological differences that include the expression of variable transcription

factor profiles and the production of different kinds of neurons19,21. Therefore, we
reasoned that individual subgroups of ependymoma might arise from regionally and
developmentally distinct NSCs that are susceptible to transformation by different gene
mutations. To test this hypothesis we first established a robust source of RG (hereon,
embryonic NSCs) and adult NSCs. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)+ cells were
isolated from the cerebrum, hindbrain and spine of embryonic day (E) 14.5 and adult BlbpeGFP transgenic mice that express eGFP within the embryonic NSC-astroglial-adult NSC
lineage22–24 (Figure 2). eGFP+ cells were isolated from both Ink4a/Arf+/+ and Ink4a/Arf−/−
mice since this locus is frequently deleted from human cerebral ependymomas (Figure 1;
Supplemental Gene Cards). When cultured under conditions that promote stem cell growth,
all 12 distinct eGFP+ cell isolates were demonstrated to be NSCs that displayed a Nestin+/
Prom1+/Gfap+/Rc2+/Blbp+ immunophenotype19 and self-renewed as clonal multipotent
neurospheres (Figure 2a and b; Supplemental Figure 5). mRNA expression profiles of 177
separate NSC cultures segregated these cells according to location (intracranial vs. spine)
and developmental stage (embryonic vs. adult), and further segregated adult intracranial
NSCs by brain region (cerebral vs. hindbrain) and Ink4a/Arf status (Figure 2b). Notably,
cerebral and hindbrain NSCs isolated from Ink4a/Arf−/− adult mice displayed an increased
self-renewal capacity (Figure 2b). Together, these data confirm functional differences
between regionally, developmentally and genetically defined NSC isolates and validate
reports that increasing Cdkn2a expression negatively regulates self-renewal in aging
cerebral NSCs25.

Author Manuscript

To pinpoint which NSCs might give rise to ependymoma subgroups, we developed a novel
algorithm that we termed agreement of differential expression (AGDEX) that detects
transcriptomic similarities between tissues from different species by comparing the
expression of shared orthologs (see Supplemental Methods). The transcriptome of cerebral
ependymomas significantly matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs
(n=14,261 orthologs, permuted P<0.05). Conversely, spinal ependymomas were most
similar to adult spinal NSCs (permuted P<0.005). Interestingly, these developmentdependent correlations reflect the epidemiology of the disease: cerebral ependymomas affect
three times more pediatric than adult patients, while spinal ependymomas are five times
more common in adults26. These data pinpoint embryonic cerebral NSCs and adult spinal
NSCs as putative cells of origin of cerebral and spinal ependymoma, respectively, and
support genetic evidence that deletion of INK4A/ARF is important in the development of
cerebral ependymoma.

Author Manuscript

To test directly if embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs represent a specific source of
cerebral ependymomas, we challenged these cells with Ephb2 that we identified to be
selectively amplified and/or over-expressed in these tumors (Figure 3a and b) and that was
shown recently to regulate stem cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the intestine27. For
comparative purposes, we also challenged a panel of four other NSC isolates (Figure 3c and
d). Freshly isolated eGFP+ NSCs were transduced at second neurosphere passage with
Ephb2-Red Fluorescence Protein (EphB2RFP) or control (cRFP) viruses (Figure 3c). 1×106
eGFP+/RFP+ NSCs were then implanted in the cerebrum of immunocompromised mice
which were observed for signs of tumor development. None of 120 mice implanted with

control-transduced NSCs developed tumors (median follow up 227 days, Figure 3d). Mice
implanted with Ephb2RFP transduced embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf+/+, adult cerebral
Ink4a/Arf−/−, embryonic hindbrain Ink4a/Arf−/− or adult spinal Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs developed
tumors with non-ependymal histologies at very low rates (9.6%, n=9/94 median follow up
241 days; Figure 3d; Supplemental Figure 6). In stark contrast, 50% of mice implanted with
Ephb2RFP transduced embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs developed EphB2+/
eGFP+/RFP+ brain tumors within 200 days of implantation, and less than 30% were tumorfree by 300 days (Log Rank P<0.0005, median follow up 230 days, Figure 3d). Remarkably,
these mouse tumors were histologically indistinguishable from human ependymomas,
displaying characteristic pseudo-rosettes, a uniform (non-nodular) distribution of cells and
clear cell phenotype—all hallmarks of certain cerebral ependymomas (Figure 4a)28.
Furthermore, electron microscopy identified microvilli, cilia and tight junctions in these
mouse tumors that are classic ultrastructural features of human ependymoma (Figure 4b).
Thus, the specific combination of embryonic cerebral NSCs, deletion of Ink4a/Arf and
amplification of EphB2 generates cerebral ependymoma, supporting strongly the hypothesis
that ependymoma variants arise from specific combinations of susceptible NSCs and
matched mutations.

Author Manuscript

To test further the fidelity of this new mouse model of cerebral ependymoma, we used the
AGDEX algorithm to correlate the ortholog expression profiles of 12 Ephb2-driven mouse
ependymomas with those of human ependymoma subgroups (A to I) as well as previously
described molecular subgroups of human glioblastoma29 and medulloblastoma30. This
analysis confirmed a highly significant and selective match between mouse and human
cerebral ependymoma but no other tested human brain tumor (permuted P <0.0001, Figure
4c). Remarkably, the transcriptome of our mouse model matched a single human cerebral
ependymoma subgroup (D), validating subgroup D as a true disease entity. Review of the
orthologs that were most significantly and differentially expressed in both Ephb2-driven
mouse ependymomas (relative to embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs) and human
subgroup D tumors (relative to other human tumors) revealed these to be highly enriched for
regulators of neural differentiation and maintenance, particularly ion transport and
synaptogenesis (n=70/160, Fisher’s Exact Test, Q<0.0001, Supplemental Table 6). Eleven
of these common signature orthologs were also targeted by CNAs in subgroup D tumors, of
which six directly regulate neurogenesis and maintenance (Supplemental Table 6). Thus, we
predict that aberrant EPHB2 signaling and deletion of INK4A/ARF disrupts key neural
differentiation pathways in embryonic cerebral NSCs during the formation of subgroup D
ependymoma.

Author Manuscript

We describe a novel cross-species genomic approach that meticulously matches subgroup
specific driver mutations and appropriate cellular compartments to model human cancer
subgroups. Similar efforts are underway to model and validate the remaining human
ependymoma subgroups. The approach described here could be applied to other cancers,
enabling the identification and matching of candidate cells of origin with appropriate
mutations to decipher molecular subgroups.

Methods Summary
Tissue samples and genomics

Author Manuscript

Human ependymoma samples were obtained from tumor banks with Institutional Review
Board approval. Human and mouse tumors comprised a minimum of 85% tumor cells.
Expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix U133 Plusv2 (mRNA human) and
430v2 (mRNA mouse) arrays and Agilent miRNA arrays (human). Expression profiles of 53
human medulloblastomas and 76 glioblastomas were obtained from previously published
studies29,30. DNA copy number analyses were performed using the Affymetrix 500K SNP
mapping arrays. CNAs were validated by real-time PCR (see Supplemental Table 4) and/or
FISH as appropriate7. mRNA and miRNA expression profiles and DNA CNAs were
analyzed, validated and integrated using established and novel bioinformatic and statistical
approaches (see Supplemental Methods). Common orthologs were filtered from human
mouse mRNA expression arrays using sequence mapping.
NSC cultures and implants

Author Manuscript

Blbp-eGFP transgenic mice were the generous gift of Dr. Nathaniel Heintz (Rockefeller
University), FVB.129-Cdkn2atm1Rdp mice were from the MMHCC repository. eGFP+ cells
were isolated from Blbp-eGFP mouse brains and spines and cultured in neural stem cell
medium as described7. NSCs were transduced with RFP-retroviruses and eGFP+/RFP+ cells
sorted using a Becton Dickinson Aria II Cell Sorter. Clonal neurosphere formation and
differentiation capacities were assessed in serial dilutions of single-cell suspensions7. NSCs
were implanted under stereotactic control into the forebrain of immunocompromised mice
and animals were observed daily for signs of tumor development7. All mouse brains were
inspected by macroscopic dissection post-mortem. Fresh tumor cells were recovered from
mouse brains as described7.
Histology
Sections of human and mouse ependymomas were prepared from formalin paraffin
embedded tissues. Protein expression was detected in formalin fixed tissue sections and
differentiated NSCs using standard immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence
techniques. Electron microscopy was performed using standard tissue preparations and a
FEI Tecnai 20 200KV FEG Electron Microscope. Western blot analysis was used to detect
protein expression in fresh tissue and cells (for antibodies see Supplemental Methods).
