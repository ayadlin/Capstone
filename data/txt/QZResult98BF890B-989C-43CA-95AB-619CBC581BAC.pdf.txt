Abstract
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) mediates breast cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis through mechanisms
that involve the growth-regulatory mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex mTORC2, but the
mechanisms involved remain obscure. Here, we report that the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 component
protein Rictor is a critical mediator of metastasis in breast cancer cells. In patients with ductal carcinoma,
Rictor expression was associated with increased lymph node metastasis. EGF induced translocation and
colocalization of Rictor with protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), a pivotal molecule in chemotaxis signaling. Further,
Rictor coimmunoprecipitated with PKCζ in the absence of the mTORC2 complex. Small interfering RNA–
mediated knockdown of Rictor inhibited EGF-induced PKCζ phosphorylation and translocation along with
phosphorylation of the key F-actin binding protein cofilin. In parallel, Rictor knockdown reduced cellular
chemotactic capacity and ablated pulmonary metastasis in a xenograft mouse model of breast cancer.
Our findings identify Rictor as an important mediator of chemotaxis and metastasis in breast cancer cells.

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a
pivotal role in cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and
survival (1, 2). Based on their sensitivity to rapamycin treatment, mTOR nucleates two distinct multiprotein complexes,
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2
(mTORC2; refs. 3, 4). The mTORC1 complex is sensitive to
rapamycin treatment and responds to a spectrum of intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, energy
status, oxygen levels, amino acids, and inflammation (3, 5).
On activation, mTORC1 promotes anabolic processes by
limiting catabolic processes. The function and regulatory
mechanisms of mTORC2 are less well defined. The mTORC2
complex is known to phosphorylate and activate Akt at Ser473
(6, 7). Moreover, preliminary studies have revealed that
disruption of mTORC2 affects actin polymerization and perturbs cell morphology (4, 8). The rapamycin-insensitive com-

panion of mTOR (Rictor) is a key component of mTORC2
and is required for mTORC2 function (4). Rictor interacts
with two additional mTORC components, mammalian
stress-activated protein kinase–interacting protein (mSIN1)
and Protor1, to form a stable structure of the mTORC2 complex (7, 9, 10). Rictor may also function as a scaffold protein
to mediate integrin-linked kinase activities (11). However, the
role of Rictor in cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis is
largely unknown.
Metastasis is the major cause of mortality and morbidity
among cancer patients. Chemotaxis is required for metastasis
(12, 13). Epidermal growth factor (EGF)–induced chemotaxis
mediates the detachment of cancer cells from primary sites
and their subsequent intravasation into the circulation (14).
Chemokine-induced chemotaxis mediates the extravasation
of circulating tumor cells to secondary sites (12, 15). The
molecular mechanism of chemotaxis has been extensively
studied in Dictyostelium discoideum. On activation by an extracellular chemical gradient, cell surface receptors activate
downstream heterotrimeric G proteins, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinases (PI3K), Cdc42, and Rac at the leading edge of a cell,
inducing actin polymerization in lamellipodia to enable cell
movement (16, 17). Meanwhile, PTEN and Rho are activated
at the back of the cell, resulting in the formation of a contractile ring by myosin II (18). Phospholipase A2 and pianissimo
(Dictyostelium discoideum homologue of Rictor) also regulate
chemotaxis by unknown mechanisms in addition to the PI3K
pathway (19, 20). In mammalian cells, paxillin and β2 integrin
are required for neutrophil chemotaxis (21), whereas integrinmediated activation of focal adhesion kinase is essential
for melanoma cell migration (22). PKCζ/PAR3/PAR6 regulates microtubule organization centers and is crucial for

astrocyte migration (23, 24). Understanding of eukaryotic cell
chemotaxis has shed light on the investigation of cancer cell
metastasis.
Chemotaxis of cancer cells is mediated by both chemokine
and growth factor receptors (12, 25, 26). Our previous report
has shown that protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) is required for
breast cancer cell chemotaxis (27). PKCζ is positively regulated by PDK1/Akt2 (28–30). Downregulation of PDK1 or Akt2
by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits the metastasis of
human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model (30, 31). Mechanistic studies suggest that PDK1/Akt2/PKCζ positively
regulates cancer cell chemotaxis by activating cofilin/
LIMK-mediated actin polymerization and integrin-mediated
cell adhesion (27, 30, 31). We hypothesize that Rictor may
regulate PKCζ in cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis. In
the current report, we investigate the expression pattern of
Rictor in human breast cancer tissues and examine its role in
chemotaxis and metastasis in a SCID mouse model.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
MDA-MB-231, T47D, and HEK293T cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection, where they were
characterized by DNA profiling. MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. All the cell lines were passaged
for <6 months in this study.
Reagents, antibodies, and animals
RPMI 1640 was obtained from Invitrogen; FBS from Life
Technologies; Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen; microBoyden chambers from Neuroprobe; recombinant human
EGF from R&D Systems; fibronectin (0.1%) from Sigma;
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Pierce Biotechnology; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets from Roche Diagnostics; antibodies against Akt, Akt2, phosphor-Akt (T308),
phosphor-Akt (S473), and phospho-PKCz from Cell Signaling
Technology; antibodies to Rictor from Bethyl Laboratories,
Inc.; human Sin1 antibody from Millipore Corp.; Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG, and Alexa Fluor 568–phalloidin from Molecular Probes,
Inc.; and SCID mice from Wei Tong Li Hua Experimental Animal Co. Ltd.
Immunohistochemical assay
Tissue microarrays were constructed with a Beecher Instruments Tissue Array as previously described (32). Archival
paraffin blocks of invasive breast cancer cases were obtained
from the Department of Breast Cancer, Tianjin Medical
University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The antibodies
and the dilution factors were as follows: Rictor (1:100), estrogen receptor (ER; 1:450; clone ID5 from DAKO), progesterone
receptor (PR; 1:200; clone IA6 from DAKO), and human EGF

receptor (EGFR) 2 (Her2/neu; 1:1,000; polyclonal from
DAKO). Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D were used
as positive control for ER and PR, respectively. An ovarian
cancer cell line, SK-OV-3, was used as a positive control for
Her2/neu staining. PBS was used in the place of the primary
antibodies in all negative controls of immunohistochemistry.
Plasmid construction, siRNA, and plasmid transfection
Full-length PKCζ was amplified by PCR and cloned into
pFlag-CMV2 vector in the EcoRI and SalI site. For transient
transfections, three Stealth siRNAs against human Rictor (#1:
5′-AAAGGAUGCAGCCAUAUUCAUUAGG-3′; #2: 5′-AACAGUUCAAGGCUGCACUGGCUCG-3′; #3: 5′-GCAGCCTTGAACTGTTTAA-3′), two Sin1-specific Stealth siRNA
duplexes (#1: 5′-GUCACUCUUUGUUCGAAUATT-3′; #2: 5′GCAAUCACGACUAUAAACATT-3′), and a scrambled siRNA
were synthesized by Invitrogen. BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo
was used to examine the transfection efficiency (Invitrogen).
Seventy-two hours after transfections, cells were harvested
and used for further experiments. For stable transfection, a
siRNA expression plasmid containing #3 target sequence and
a vector containing a scrambled sequence were obtained
from Genechem Co. Stable transfectants were selected by using 800 μg/mL hygromycin B.
Reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and
isolation of membrane fractions
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting
assay were performed as described previously (27, 31). Briefly,
PCRs were performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C
for 5 minutes was followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds,
60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. The PCR primers
were as follows: Rictor (forward: 5′-TTTCGGGGATTTCTGGATG-3′, reverse: 5′-AAAGCCCAGTCTCATGACATT-3′) and
β-actin (forward: 5′-GGCCGGGACCTGACTGACTAC-3′, reverse: 5′-GCCGCCAGACAGCACTGTGTT-3′). Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF for 0 second, 30 seconds, 1 minute,
2 minutes, and 5 minutes, and phosphorylation of integrin β1,
cofilin, PKCζ, and Akt was analyzed. A protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail were added to the cell
lysis buffer before protein extraction.
To isolate membrane fraction, cells were resuspended in
500 μL of subcellular fractionation buffer (250 mmol/L sucrose, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and protein inhibitor
cocktail) at 4°C and lysed through a 25-gauge needle 10 times
using a 1-mL syringe. Lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g
for 10 minutes to remove nuclear pellet, and supernatants
were centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 hour. The supernatant was the cytosol fraction. The pellet, the membrane
fraction, was washed and resuspended in the lysis buffer with
10% glycerol and 0.2% SDS for further analysis.
Cell proliferation, chemotaxis, adhesion, and
wound-healing assay
Cell proliferation assay was done as described previously
(33). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates. Twenty
microliters of the stock MTT solution (5 mg/mL) in PBS were

added to each well at different times and incubated for 4
hours at 37°C. Cell activity was calculated by the absorbency
at 570 nm. Chemotaxis assays were performed by using micro-Boyden chambers as described previously (27). After 3
hours of chemotaxis assay in a 37°C humidified incubator
for 3 hours, the membranes were fixed and stained. The
number of migrating cells was counted by light microscopy
at 400× (high-powered field). In adhesion assays, cells were
suspended in serum-free medium at a final concentration
of 4 × 105/mL and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. The
suspension with or without 10 ng/mL EGF was added into
a 3.5-mm dish containing fibronectin-coated glass coverslips.
After an incubation of 5, 15, and 30 minutes, the coverslips
were washed with PBS and fixed. The attached cells were
counted under a light microscope at 200×. For woundhealing assays, cells were seeded in six-well plates and grown
until 100% confluence (31). After making a straight scratch by
using a pipette tip, cells were incubated in a minimum medium (containing 0.5% FBS) in a 37% humidified incubator
for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours and the wound distances were
measured under a light microscope.
Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed as described previously with minor modification (27). Briefly, cells were plated
in 12-well plates containing sterile coverslips, allowed for
24-hour growth, and starved in serum-free RPMI 1640 for

at least 3 hours. After stimulation with 10 ng/mL EGF for
10 minutes at 37°C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 50 mmol/L NH4Cl, permeabilized in
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 3% bovine serum
albumin. Cells were stained with anti-Rictor and/or antiPKCζ antibodies and probed with either an Alexa Fluor
488– or an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated secondary antibody.
Coverslips were mounted and visualized with confocal laser
scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP5). For wound-healing
assays, cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hours, then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with anti-Rictor and
anti-PKCζ antibodies. Colocalization efficiency was calculated
through ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The plasma
membrane regions of the cell or full image were selected as
the region of interest to quantify the colocalization efficiency.
Twenty-five images were analyzed.
Coimmunoprecipitation
Coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described with
minor modification (4). Briefly, cells were seeded in 10-cm
dishes and grown to 80% to 90% confluence. After 4 hours
of serum starvation, cells were either left unstimulated or
stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF for 5 minutes. After washing
three times with PBS, cells were lysed in 1 mL of ice-cold cell
lysis buffer (40 mmol/L HEPES, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100 or 0.3% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L pyrophosphate, 10 mmol/L
glycerophosphate, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1.5 mmol/L Na 3VO 4 ,

pH 7.5) on ice for 30 minutes. After centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 15 minutes, supernatants were removed and
precleared by adding 50 μL of protein A for an hour. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated by using anti-PKCζ or
anti-Rictor antibodies. The immunocomplex was captured
by adding 50 μL of protein A and subjected to Western blotting analysis.
In vivo spontaneous metastasis assay
Metastasis assays were performed as described previously
(31). Briefly, siRictor and control cells were grown until the
log phase, trypsinized, and washed four times with serumfree medium. Four-week-old female SCID mice were injected
s.c. into the mammary fat pads with 2 × 106 cells (n = 10 per
group). Tumor diameters were measured every week after
injection of cancer cells. After 6 or 9 weeks, the mice were
sacrificed, the tumors were isolated, and tumor weights were
measured. To examine spontaneous metastasis, the lungs
were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Serial sections and H&E staining were performed to detect
lung micrometastasis.

Results
Expression of Rictor is correlated with lymph node
metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma patients
Invasive ductal carcinoma accounts for >80% of breast
cancer incidents in China.1 The expression of Rictor was examined by immunohistochemistry in 39 pairs of invasive
ductal carcinoma tissues, including tumors and tumor-associated tissues. Positive staining was detected in 25 tumor
samples but only in three tumor-associated tissues, suggesting that expression of Rictor is elevated during tumorigenesis
(Fig. 1). Indeed, Rictor was observed at a significantly higher
rate in tumor samples than in tumor-associated tissue (P <
0.001). Further statistical analysis revealed that Rictor expression was detected in 24 of 26 lymph node metastasis cases
(P = 0.003; Table 1). In 13 non–lymph node metastasis cases,
only one tumor tissue was positive. These results strongly
suggest that expression of Rictor is associated with metastasis, either as a cause or as a consequence. Taken together,
these results indicate that the expression of Rictor is elevated
in breast cancer tissues and is associated with lymph node
metastasis.
Knockdown of Rictor by siRNA inhibits cancer
cell migration
We hypothesize that Rictor plays an important role in metastasis by regulating cancer cell chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, three independent siRNAs (#1, #2, and #3 siRNA)
were designed to target Rictor, and a scrambled sequence
was used as a control. Transient transfection with each of

three siRNA specifically downregulated Rictor expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas transfection with the scrambled
sequence did not (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis showed a
block at EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, indicating that the function of Rictor was inhibited in siRictor cells
(Fig. 2A; refs. 6, 34). One of the siRNA sequences was selected
to generate stable clones of Rictor knockdown cells. Three
representative clones (clones 4, 11, and 15) were used in the
analysis (Fig. 2B). All three clones had similar phenotypes;
thus, we choose to present the results from clone 4 as the
representative, which is designated as siRictor. A scrambled
sequence was used to replace the siRNA sequence in the
expressing vector and transfected to generate a stable cell line,
designated as Scrambled (Scr). Scr cells showed a level of
Rictor comparable with their parental cells, MDA-MB-231,
suggesting that the expressing vector did not interfere with
Rictor expression. MTT assays revealed that siRictor clones
showed an average reduction of 15% in cell proliferation
in vitro, which did not interfere with the following assays
of chemotaxis properties (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined siRictor
cells by using a scratch assay in a serum-free medium. As
shown in Fig. 2D, siRictor cells failed to fill the gap 12 hours
after the scratch, suggesting that directional migration
was impaired. Taken together, we were able to downregulate
Rictor levels by siRNA and siRictor cells had a defect in directional migration.

Knockdown of Rictor severely impaired chemotaxis of
human breast cancer cells
Our previous report has shown that PKCζ mediates EGFinduced chemotaxis by regulating actin polymerization
(27, 35). As shown in Fig. 3A, knockdown of Rictor or PKCζ
by transient transfection inhibited EGF-induced chemotaxis
of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3A). All three stable siRNA clones
were also defective in chemotaxis (Fig. 3A). Downregulation
of Rictor or PKCζ in T47D, another human breast cancer cell
line, also impaired EGF-induced chemotaxis (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Both cell adhesion and actin polymerization are

required for a robust chemotaxis (36, 37). As shown in
Fig. 3B and C, EGF-induced cell adhesion and phosphorylation of integrin β1 was impaired in siRictor cells. Cofilin, an
actin associate protein, plays an important role in actin polymerization (27). As shown in Fig. 3D, EGF-induced cofilin
phosphorylation was inhibited in Rictor knockdown cells.
Moreover, EGF-induced actin polymerization was altered
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, our results indicate
that Rictor regulates EGF-induced human breast cancer cell
chemotaxis, probably by mediating cell adhesion and actin
polymerization.

plasma membrane as determined by image analysis
through ImageJ software (Fig. 4A). Western blotting analysis showed EGF-induced increase of PKCζ and Rictor in
plasma membrane fraction, further confirming the observation from confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 4A). Next,
scratch assays revealed that both Rictor and PKCζ proteins
were enriched in the front of migratory cells along with
PKCζ (Fig. 4B).
The translocation of both Rictor and PKCζ was analyzed
in knockdown cells. Knockdown of Rictor inhibited EGFinduced translocation of PKCζ (Fig. 4C; Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Furthermore, EGF-induced phosphorylation of
PKCζ was reduced in siRictor cells (Fig. 4D). In siPKCζ cells,
EGF still induced membrane translocation of Rictor (Fig. 4C;
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together, the results suggest
that Rictor may act upstream of PKCζ and is required for
full activation of PKCζ.
Rictor interacted with PKCζ in the absence of mTOR
The interaction between Rictor and PKCζ was examined
by coimmunoprecipitation assays. In a lysis buffer containing
0.3% CHAPS to preserve the integrity of mTORC2 complex,
Rictor coprecipitated with mTOR and PKCζ, whereas PKCζ
only coprecipitated with Rictor but not with mTOR (Fig. 5A).
In a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, which disrupted

mTORC2, Rictor still coprecipitated with PKCζ, suggesting
that mTOR2 complex was not required for the interaction
between Rictor and PKCζ. Rictor also coimmunoprecipitated
with Flag-PKCζ overexpressed in HEK293T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Sin1 is an essential component of mTOR2 complex (7, 10).
Knockdown of Sin1 disrupted the function of mTORC2
(Fig. 5C). However, Rictor still coimmunoprecipitated with
PKCζ in Sin1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, Sin1
knockdown cells showed robust chemotaxis properties
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, results suggest that interaction between Rictor and PKCζ does not require the integrity
of mTORC2.
Downregulation of Rictor by siRNA inhibited tumor
growth and metastasis of human breast tumors
The metastasis properties of siRictor cells were analyzed
in vivo through a xenograft transplant model in SCID mice.
Scr and siRictor cells were implanted into the mammary
fat pads of SCID mouse. After 6 weeks, a significant reduction in tumor growth was detected in mice with transplanted siRictor cells, suggesting that Rictor plays an
important role in tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 6A). Lung metastasis of human breast cancer cells was evaluated
through staining with H&E. No tumor foci were detected

in the lungs of siRictor-implanted mice. In contrast, extensive tumor foci were found in 6 of 10 mice transplanted
with scrambled siRNA controls. To rule out the influence
of tumor growth in metastasis assays, during the second
sets of experiments, mice implanted with siRictor cells
were allowed to grow to 9 weeks, 3 weeks longer than
those implanted with control cells. As shown in Fig. 6B,
the sizes of primary tumors from siRictor-implanted mice
were slightly larger than those from control mice. Lung
metastasis from siRictor cells was still significantly lower

than that from control cells. Thus, our results clearly indicate that Rictor is required for metastasis of human breast
cancers in vivo.

Discussion
Our results support the hypothesis that Rictor plays an important role in cancer cell metastasis. Pathologic investigation of patient tissues indicates that Rictor is expressed in
∼64% of ductal carcinoma tumor samples and only 7% in

Rictor Mediates Metastasis

tumor-associated tissues, suggesting that the majority of
cancer patients have enhanced Rictor expression within their
tumors. Microscopic analysis of the 7% of Rictor-positive
tumor-associated tissues by pathologists revealed changes in
cell morphology, suggesting that these tissues may be in the
early stages of tumorigenesis. The most striking evidence to
support the premise that Rictor plays a role in metastasis
involves the analysis of lymph nodes from metastasis patients,
which are 92% Rictor-positive compared with <10% Rictorpositive samples from non–lymph node metastasis patients.
In animal experiments, downregulation of Rictor through
siRNA inhibited metastasis of human breast cancer cells to
the lungs of SCID mice, providing molecular evidence that
Rictor is required for spontaneous metastasis of human breast
cancer cells in vivo.
Previous studies have suggested that knockdown of Rictor
impairs actin cytoskeleton structure (4, 8). Our current study
indicates that Rictor colocalizes with PKCζ at the leading
edges of cells. Endogenous Rictor interacts with PKCζ in
the absence of mTORC2 complex. Knockdown of Rictor inhibited PKCζ translocation and full activation. In siRictor cells,
EGF-induced cofilin phosphorylation was impaired. Thus, our
results suggest a novel mechanism of Rictor in chemotaxis of
human cancer cells. Knockdown of Rictor expression inhibits
PKCα activity in HeLa and glioma cells (4, 38). PKCα also regulates actin structure in these cells. However, in both human
breast cancer cells and leukocytes, treatment with inhibitors
of classic PKC does not inhibit chemotaxis (27). Thus, the
function of PKCα in chemotaxis may be cell type specific.
Our results suggest that Rictor interacts and regulates
PKCζ activation independent of mTORC2. Rictor was initially
identified as a scaffold protein for the mTORC2 complex (4).
Knockdown of Sin1, an essential component of mTORC2,

munoprecipitation between Rictor and PKCζ, suggesting that
mTORC2 may not play a role in regulating EGF-induced cancer cell chemotaxis. A report by McDonald and colleagues
(11) suggests that Rictor may also form a complex with other
proteins, such as integrin-linked kinase. Thus, it is plausible
that Rictor as a general scaffold protein, but not mTORC2, is
required for EGF-induced chemotaxis of cancer cells.
Identifying the role of Rictor in cancer cell chemotaxis and
metastasis provides a novel molecule for cancer diagnosis,
prognosis, and therapy. Immunohistochemical assays suggest that Rictor may be a novel biomarker for breast cancer
metastasis. In addition, the expression of Rictor is closely
linked with papillary renal cell carcinoma, a highly metastatic
cancer.1 In lung cancer patients, expression of Rictor is inversely linked with 3-year surviving rate.2 Our results also
suggest that Rictor can be used as a novel drug target to treat
cancer metastasis. In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
D. discoideum, cells are viable on disruption of rictor gene,
suggesting that targeting Rictor will not cause severe cytotoxicity (20). Thus, Rictor may be used as a novel biomarker
or as a target to develop novel metastasis therapy.
