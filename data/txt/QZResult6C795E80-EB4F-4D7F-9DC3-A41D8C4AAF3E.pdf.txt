BACKGROUND: The proliferation of clonal cytotoxic T-cells or natural killer cells has been observed after dasatinib treatment in small
studies of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: The incidence of lymphocytosis and its association with
response, survival, and side effects were assessed in patients from 3 large clinical trials. Overall, 1402 dasatinib-treated patients with
newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP), CML-CP refractory/intolerant to imatinib, or with CML in accelerated or myeloidblast phase were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymphocytosis developed in 32% to 35% of patients and persisted for >12 months. This was not
observed in the patients who received treatment with imatinib. Dasatinib-treated patients in all stages of CML who developed lymphocytosis were more likely to achieve a complete cytogenetic response, and patients who had CML-CP with lymphocytosis were
more likely to achieve major and deep molecular responses. Progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly longer in
patients with CML-CP who were refractory to or intolerant of imatinib and had lymphocytosis. Pleural effusions developed more commonly in patients with lymphocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, lymphocytosis occurred and persisted in many dasatinib-treated
patients in all phases of CML. Its presence was associated with higher response rates, significantly longer response durations, and
increased overall survival, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect. Prospective studies are warranted to characterize the functional

INTRODUCTION
Dasatinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed,
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CML-CP); adults with
CML-CP, CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP), CML in myeloid-blast phase (CML-MBP), or CML in lymphoid-blast
phase (CML-LBP) who have resistance/intolerance to prior therapy, including imatinib; and adults with Ph-positive,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have resistance/intolerance to prior therapy.1 Although dasatinib primarily
inhibits the constitutively active tyrosine kinase breakpoint cluster region/Abelson 1 proto-oncogene (BCR-ABL1),2 it
was initially developed as an SRC family kinase inhibitor.3 It also acts on other kinases, including KIT, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor, the ephrin-A receptor, and TEC family kinases.2-6
The immunosuppressive effects of dasatinib were initially observed in preclinical studies.3 The known effects of
dasatinib on normal hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are limited, but in vitro and animal models suggest that dasatinib
may inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and function without inducing apoptosis.7-11 ABL1 and SRC family kinase signaling pathways, both of which are inhibited by dasatinib, are essential for T-cell proliferation, function, and survival.12-14
Therefore, it was somewhat surprising that clonal expansion of cytotoxic T-cells or natural killer (NK) cells (T/NK)
was detected (median time to detection, 1-4 months) after initiation of dasatinib therapy in small studies of CML or
patients with Ph-positive ALL.15-25 Few studies have evaluated whether this population was present before treatment,
although Kreutzman et al25 demonstrated expansion of a BCR-ABL1–negative lymphocyte population with T-cell

receptor c/d rearrangements (present at the time of CML
diagnosis) after dasatinib treatment. Some analyses have
suggested that T/NK lymphoproliferation was associated
with higher than expected rates of cytogenetic and molecular response, particularly in patients with advanced disease, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect.16-21 Also,
an increase in certain side effects, such as pleural effusions,
has been reported.20-24 Resolution of pleural effusion and
T/NK lymphocytosis has been described after switching
from dasatinib to another TKI.26 T/NK cell expansion
has not been described after CML treatment with other
TKIs. To our knowledge, no prior study has systematically evaluated the effects of these findings on response to
treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), or overall survival (OS).
For an illustrative example, a woman who progressed to CML-MBP despite prior imatinib treatment
was treated with dasatinib alone in June 2005 and, as of
her last visit in late 2015, remains in remission with undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts (Fig. 1). Her treatment
was complicated by the development of a chronic pleural
effusion. Lymphocytosis, reaching > 7000/mm3, had
been present for approximately 9 years, with cells characterized as T/NK cells by flow cytometry. Although elevated on most occasions, several lymphocyte counts were
in the normal range, which may reflect the documented
pharmacodynamic effect of the plasma level of dasatinib
and the lymphocyte count.27
To expand on these observational studies, we analyzed the incidence of lymphocytosis in a large group of
patients (n 5 1402) with CML-CP, CML-AP, and
CML-MBP who received treatment with dasatinib and
were enrolled in prospective clinical trials with long-term
follow-up. Here, we report our results describing the association between the development of lymphocytosis and
initial response, long-term outcome, and the development
of pleural effusions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Eligibility

We previously presented data in abstract form from
patients with CML-CP in the “Src/ABL Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibition Activity Research Trials of Dasatinib”
(START) Program’s phase 2, second-line START-A,
START-B, START-C, and START-R trials and the phase
3 Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive
CML Patients (DASISION) trial (CA180-056; clinicaltrials.gov NCT00481247).20,28 This report focuses on

long-term follow-up. Retrospective analyses were conducted using 5-year, long-term data from dasatinib-treated
patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP in the DASISION trial29; 7-year, long-term data from patients with
CML-CP resistant/intolerant to imatinib in the phase 3
dose-optimization trial (CA180-034; NCT00123474)30;
and 5-year, long-term data from patients with CML-AP or
CML-MBP who were resistant to/intolerant of imatinib in
the phase 3 dose-optimization trial for patients with
advanced-phase CML (CA180-035; NCT00123487).31
Entry criteria for these studies have been published
elsewhere.29-31 Briefly, eligible patients in the DASISION
trial included adults with cytogenetically confirmed, Phpositive CML-CP within 3 months from diagnosis who
had adequate hepatic and renal function and no serious
medical conditions. No prior CML therapy was permitted
except for anagrelide or hydroxyurea. Patients received
treatment with either dasatinib 100 mg once daily or
imatinib 400 mg once daily. Patients in CA180-034 were
required to be aged 18 years and to have Ph-positive
CML-CP with primary or acquired resistance/intolerance
to imatinib. Patients in CA180-034 received dasatinib at
doses of 100 mg once daily, 140 mg once daily, 50 mg
twice daily, or 70 mg twice daily. In CA180-035, patients
with CML-AP, CML-MBP/LBP, or Ph-positive ALL
aged  18 years and who had developed primary or
acquired resistance/intolerance to imatinib were enrolled.
Patients in CA180-035 received treatment with dasatinib
either 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice daily. Each of the
3 trials was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by local ethics committees
or institutional review boards. All patients gave written
informed consent.
Lymphocytosis

Lymphocytosis was defined as lymphocyte counts
>3.6 3 109/L on at least 2 consecutive occasions after 28
days of treatment. Complete blood counts, typically with
automated differential counts, were performed at least
weekly for the initial 1 to 2 months of treatment, then
monthly, and every 3 months thereafter during long-term
follow-up. In general, total white blood cell counts were
normal in dasatinib-treated patients after 1 to 2 months
(within accuracy range for differential counts). The timing of dasatinib dosing relative to lymphocyte assessments
was not known. Flow cytometry was not performed,
because the observation of lymphocytosis was not considered until after these trials were under way. We did not
study patients in lymphoid blastic phase because serial
slides were unavailable. The sole use of an automated
1399

lymphocyte count may have caused potential confusion
between lymphoblasts and other lymphoid elements.
Analyses

The incidence, timing, and duration of lymphocytosis
were determined. The duration of lymphocytosis was
defined as the interval between the date of original detection and the date of last available follow-up sample that
was positive for lymphocytosis. Rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) (based on analysis of 20 metaphases), major molecular response (MMR) (BCR-ABL1
transcripts  0.1% on the International Scale [IS]),
molecular response4.5 (MR4.5) (BCR-ABL1 transcripts
 0.0032% on the IS), PFS, OS, and incidence of pleural
effusion were compared between patients with and without lymphocytosis. Landmark analyses of PFS and OS for
patients with or without lymphocytosis at 3 months were
also performed. Progression in patients with CML-CP
was defined as an increasing white blood cell count; loss of
a complete hematologic response or a major cytogenetic
response; an increase  30% in Ph-positive metaphases;
or transformation to CML-AP, CML-MBP, or CMLLBP.
The log-rank test was used to calculate P values for
PFS and OS (Fig. 2), the Fisher exact test was used to calculate P values for incidences of responses and pleural
effusion, and logistic regression was used to examine the
relation between the binary response variable lymphocytosis (yes/no) and a set of predictive variables. Statistical
comparisons were not prespecified, and comparisons were
not adjusted for multiplicity; therefore, P values are provided solely for informative purposes.
RESULTS
Patients and Incidence of Lymphocytosis

Patients’ disease and demographic characteristics at baseline in the different studies are provided in Table 1. The
median age ranged from 46 to 56 years, and there were
slightly more men than women. For patients in the
second-line dasatinib studies, the median duration of
prior imatinib therapy was from 16 to 40 months, and up
to 46% of patients received  800 mg daily. Overall, 74%
to 81% of patients were resistant to imatinib, whereas
16% to 26% of patients were intolerant. The baseline median lymphocyte counts in treated patients ranged from
1.7 3 109/L to 3.0 3 109/L in the 3 studies. A minority of
patients (range, 14%-41%) had a single lymphocyte
count >3.6 3 109/L at enrollment. However, most such
patients in chronic and blast phases had elevated white
blood cells at study entry, and automated differential
1400

counts likely are less accurate in such circumstances. In
contrast, our definition of lymphocytosis demanded that
the count be elevated on at least 2 consecutive occasions,
and this almost always occurred at a time when the total
white blood cell count was relatively normal after the
cytoreductive effects from the dasatinib.
The cumulative incidence of lymphocytosis was
comparable across all phases of CML (range, 32%-35%)
(Table 2) and was similar in patients who had CML-CP,
irrespective of prior imatinib treatment. The maximal
lymphocyte counts and the counts at the time of initial
detection of lymphocytosis are provided in Table 2. There
was no difference in the occurrence of lymphocytosis
among the different dasatinib doses and schedules evaluated in study CA180-034. The distribution of Hasford
risk scores was similar for patients who did and did not develop lymphocytosis in the DASISION trial (data not
shown), and there was no effect of age or sex. Lymphocytosis developed rapidly after dasatinib initiation, with a
median time to detection of 3 to 5 months. A first incidence of lymphocytosis after 5 to 6 months of treatment
was very uncommon; however, many patients, particularly those with CML-AP and CML-MBP, were no longer
receiving dasatinib at that time (median on-treatment follow-up, 6.1 months). In the DASISION study, lymphocytosis was observed in 35% and 8% of dasatinib- and
imatinib-treated patients, respectively, and was almost
invariably transient in the imatinib-treated patients (data
not shown).
The duration of lymphocytosis varied across the
different phases of CML (range, 1.4-33.8 months)
(Table 2), possibly influenced by the differing rates of
dasatinib discontinuation, specifically in patients with
advanced disease. In addition, lymphocytosis may have
been missed in some patients because only single samples
were obtained approximately every 3 months during
long-term follow-up. Thus, the median durations of lymphocytosis of 33.8 and 12.9 months in patients with
CML-CP in the DASISION and CA180-034 trials,
respectively, may have been underestimated. Nonetheless,
at minimum, from 52% to 77% of patients with CMLCP who developed lymphocytosis had it persist for
12 months. Furthermore, it is likely that some patients
in whom lymphocytosis was no longer detected had discontinued dasatinib treatment.
Response to Treatment

Response to treatment was assessed at approximately 3month intervals. Lymphocytosis was associated with statistically significantly higher rates of CCyR in all phases of

follow-up of any of the studies analyzed (7 years). The
separation of the curves began at approximately 2 years after the start of treatment. Although patients with newly
diagnosed CML-CP who had lymphocytosis had more
prolonged PFS and OS than patients without lymphocytosis, these results were not significantly different with 5
years of follow-up (PFS, P 5 .1133; OS, P 5 .3452) (Fig.

(CML-AP, P 5 .23; CML-MBP, P 5 .0615) or OS
(CML-AP, P 5 .7844; CML-MBP, P 5 .4217) in
patients with more advanced phases of CML, irrespective
of lymphocytosis (Fig. 2e-h). Landmark analyses evaluating patients with or without lymphocytosis at 3 months
(ie, the median time until the detection of lymphocytosis)
did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in
PFS or OS for patients with or without lymphocytosis,
regardless of disease phase (data not shown).

Side Effects: Pleural Effusion

Pleural effusion is arguably the most unique, common
nonhematologic toxicity after treatment with dasatinib,
and patients have been described with elevated T/NK
lymphocytes in their pleural fluid after such treatment.22
The incidence of pleural effusion was numerically greater
in patients with lymphocytosis in all phases of CML than
in patients without lymphocytosis (Table 4). These differences were statistically significant in patients with CMLAP (P 5 .0003) and of borderline significance
(P 5 .0655) in patients with presumably more advanced
CML-CP who received dasatinib as second-line or thirdline treatment. In an earlier analysis of dasatinib-treated
patients who had lymphocytosis from the DASISION
trial, except for a slight increase in the incidence of rash
(all incidences were grade 1 or 2), there were no differences in the frequency of other side effects, including diarrhea, fatigue, constitutional symptoms, or myalgias.20

Lymphocytosis After Dasatinib/Schiffer et al

Figure 1. (a,b) The treatment of a woman who had imatinib-resistant, blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with splenomegaly,
fever, and bone pain was complicated by the development of a chronic pleural effusion.

DISCUSSION
We demonstrate here for the first time in large studies
that lymphocytosis commonly occurs after treatment
with dasatinib, but not imatinib. Analyses of 3 large
clinical trial populations (n 5 1402) in different stages
of CML who received treatment with a variety of different doses of dasatinib and were followed for as long
as 7 years, demonstrate that lymphocytosis develops in
a minimum of 32% of patients and persists for 1
year in at least 50% of such patients. Although immunophenotyping was not done, it is very likely that this
represents expansion of a T/NK-cell population, given
the findings from smaller studies that have characterized this proliferation in dasatinib-treated patients.
Lymphocytosis was demonstrated in a similar proportion of patients in all clinical phases and occurred relatively rapidly, with most cases identified within 3 to 5
months after the initiation of dasatinib treatment.
It is also likely that the 32% to 35% incidence of
lymphocytosis represents an underestimate, because 2
consecutive blood samples with an elevated count were
required. The case study in Figure 1 indicates that occasional lymphocyte counts were in the normal range, suggesting that lymphocytosis in some patients may have
been missed because of the use of a somewhat conservative
definition. Some of these fluctuations may be related to
the temporal relation between the ingestion of dasatinib
and the acquisition of the blood sample, as reported in a
Cancer

May 1, 2016

recent study demonstrating that increased numbers of
T/NK cells can be detected within 1 to 2 hours after
dasatinib administration, even in normal individuals,
with a correlation between peak blood levels and T/NK
counts.27
It is noteworthy that higher rates of CCyR were
observed in dasatinib-treated patients who had lymphocytosis in all phases of CML, as were the rates of MMR and
deeper MRs (MR4.5) in patients with CML-CP. For the
first time, we demonstrate that PFS and OS are significantly longer in patients with imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP who have longer follow-up, which might be
expected if an “immunologic” effect were operative. This
is consistent with other immune-mediated therapies in
which positive effects on longer term outcomes are often
the most prominent findings. Given the substantial
impact of subsequent therapies and the somewhat shorter
follow-up, it is perhaps not unexpected that there was no
significant impact on OS in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. It is somewhat disappointing that there
was no difference in either PFS or OS in the overall population with more advanced stages of CML, given the previous suggestions regarding unexpectedly long responses
from the many cases and anecdotal observations (Fig. 1).
However, it may be difficult for any putative immunomodulatory effect to overcome the proliferative thrust of
active disease in patients with CML-MBP, although longer term benefits may occur in patients who can maintain

PFS and (b) OS are illustrated in patients who had chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) in the dasatinib treatment arm from the Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive CML Patients (DASISION) trial (median follow-up, 60.5

dasatinib treatment. More detailed studies of the immunologic activity of cells from “exceptional” responders
would be of interest.
Interpretation of these retrospective data may have
been affected by other considerations. For example, the
lymphocyte cutoff we used would not detect lower levels
of T/NK proliferation, which may also influence clinical
outcome. Nonetheless, given the clear correlation between
the occurrence of lymphocytosis and the development of
pleural effusions, the effects on response rate for all stages
of CML, and the significant increase in PFS and OS in
patients with previously treated CML-CP, it appears that
our definition enabled us to capture clinically relevant
associations. Certainly, lymphocytosis after dasatinib
treatment is a consistent and potentially clinically important biologic phenomenon, and it is hoped that several of
these questions can be addressed with prospective evaluations of lymphocyte subpopulations in future studies.
The mechanism by which dasatinib induces these
changes is unclear. Lymphocytosis has not been noted after CML treatment with other TKIs,32-34 and we convincingly confirm this observation here through analysis of
patients with CML-CP who were treated on a randomized
study of dasatinib versus imatinib. A few trials evaluating
dasatinib in patients with solid tumors have been conducted in which lymphocytosis has not been reported,35
although it could have been missed, because it is not a typical focus of toxicity assessments. Although primarily targeted against BCR-ABL1 in CML, dasatinib has effects
on multiple kinases and signaling pathways.2,4-6 Indeed,

there had been some initial concern about lymphopenia
and immunosuppression because of the effect of dasatinib
on SRC signaling. Clinical reports have documented
mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5B among patients with large
granular lymphocytic leukemia,36,37 a pathway that may
be of interest for patients with CML who have dasatinibinduced lymphocytosis. Finally, a recent publication evaluating dasatinib-treated patients with CML documented
increases in the numbers of functionally active memory
CD4-positive and CD8-positive Th1-type T-helper cells
capable of producing interferon-c, suggesting potential
for an immunomodulatory effect that is undetected in
patients who are taking imatinib or nilotinib.38
In summary, lymphocytosis occurs frequently with
dasatinib treatment, persists for 1 year and is associated
with higher response rates, increased PFS and OS in
patients with CML-CP who are refractory to or intolerant
of imatinib, and the development of pleural effusions.
Prospective studies can better characterize the functional
activity of these lymphocytes and assess whether an immunologic effect against CML cells is detectable, perhaps focusing on patients with CML-AP or CML in blast crisis
who have unexpectedly long responses to treatment and
those with deep molecular responses who are considering
treatment discontinuation. Given the frequency of the
effect on lymphocytosis in CML, trials using dasatinib to
treat other diseases, possibly in combination with other
immunomodulatory agents, would be of interest. Two trials are currently evaluating dasatinib postautologous and
