ABSTRACT
Approximately 15–40% of the general adult population suffers from non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide. However, no drug is currently licensed for
its treatment. In this study, we observed a significant reduction of miR-30c-5p in
the liver of leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice. Remarkably, recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV)-mediated delivery of miR-30c-5p was sufficient to attenuate
triglyceride accumulation and hepatic steatosis in db/db mice. Through computational
prediction, KEGG analysis and Ago2 co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that miR30c-5p directly targeted fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis.
Moreover, down-regulation of FASN by siRNA attenuated some key features of NAFLD,
including decreased triglyceride accumulate and lipid deposition. Our findings reveal a
new role of miR-30c-5p in counterbalancing fatty acid biosynthesis, which is sufficient
to attenuate triglyceride accumulation and hepatic steatosis in db/db mice.

INTRODUCTION

degradation, depending on the ability to bind their
mRNA targets [8]. Due to their extraordinary variability
of expression patterns and functions across tissues
and physiological/pathophysiological states, miRNAs
can be powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tools in
various disorders, such as cancer, neurological diseases,
cardiovascular diseases and metabolism disorders including
NAFLD [9–12]. Specifically, up-regulation of miR-125b
by estrogen protects against NAFLD in female mice [13].
MiR-21 decreases the levels of triglyceride and cholesterol
by targeting HMGCR [14]. Thus, these studies have raised
the enthusiasm to explore the roles of miRNAs in NAFLD.
Our published data discovered dysregulated
circulating miR-30 family in patients with high risk factors of
coronary artery disease, such as hyperlipidemia [12], which
indicated that miR-30 family might be metabolism related
miRNAs. Though the same seed sequence is shared by all
the members of the miR-30 family, miR-30c-5p possess the
highest abundance in liver, compared with other miR-30s
(our unpublished data). While previous work demonstrated
that miR-30c reduced atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice [15],
the role of miR-30c-5p in NAFLD remained elusive.

With the obesity pandemic, non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common
chronic liver disease affecting 15–40% of the general adult
population and an important cause of cirrhosis and hepatic
carcinoma worldwide [1–3]. NAFLD is composed of a
series of pathological changes in liver: 1) The initial stage
is hepatic steatosis, characterized by the excess deposition
of triglyceride and/or cholesterol in liver; 2) Abnormal
hepatic lipid accumulation results from augmented de
novo lipogenesis, and/or decreased β-oxidation; 3) If
uncontrolled, hepatic steatosis can progress to cirrhosis,
end-stage liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [4, 5].
Currently, no drug is licensed for the treatment of NAFLD
[3, 6] , and thus it is important to understand the mechanisms
underlying NAFLD and develop new intervention strategies.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous,
small, non-coding RNAs, which emerge as powerful
regulators in many essential biological processes [7].
MiRNAs suppress gene expression through two major
mechanisms: translational repression or mRNA cleavage/

In the present study, we found that miR-30c-5p was
significantly decreased in liver of leptin receptor deficient
(db/db) mice, a classic animal model for liver steatosis [5].
And strikingly, exogenous miR-30c-5p delivered by
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) markedly
ameliorated abnormal triglyceride accumulation and
liver steatosis in db/db mice, suggesting a new therapeutic
strategy against NAFLD.

decreased in db/db mice compared to C57BL/Ks controls,
while treating with rAAV-miR-30c-5p-TUD aggravated
this decrease in liver of db/db mice. On the contrary,
comparing with db/db controls or C57BL/Ks controls,
increased hepatic miR-30c-5p was observed in rAAV-miR30c-5p treated db/db mice (Figure 2A). The level of blood
glucose in db/db mice was much higher than C57BL/ks
mice, but was not changed by miR-30c-5p over-expression
(Figure 2B).
Further, the effects of miR-30c-5p on plasma lipids
were detected. Compared with C57BL/Ks controls,
increased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), but decreased high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) was observed in db/db mice. Interestingly,
compared with untreated db/db mice, fasting glucose,
TC, HDL and LDL remained unaltered in rAAV-miR30c-5p or rAAV-miR-30c-5p-TUD treated db/db mice
(Figure 2B–2E). However, overexpression of miR-30c-5p
significantly attenuated plasma triglyceride accumulation
in db/db mice, while rAAV-miR-30c-5p-TUD aggravated
it (Figure 2F).
Conclusively, miR-30c-5p decreased only plasma
triglyceride level, but not glucose or cholesterol in db/db
mice.

RESULTS
Decreased miR-30c-5p expression and increased
triglyceride accumulation was detected in db/db
mice liver
To explore the role of miR-30c-5p in NAFLD, realtime PCR was used to detect miR-30c-5p expression in
db/db mice, a classic animal model for NAFLD. Compared
with C57BL/Ks controls, significantly decreased
miR-30c-5p was observed in liver of 24-week-old db/db
mice (Figure 1A). Notably, miR-30c-5p was also decreased
in other tissues of db/db mice. To further determine
whether the decreased miR-30c-5p was hyperglycemiaor hyperlipidemia-dependent, cultured HepG2 cells were
treated with high glucose and palmitate, respectively.
Interestingly, high glucose treatment did not induce change
of miR-30c-5p level, while palmitate significantly inhibited
miR-30c-5p expression in HepG2 cells (Figure 1B and 1C).
Meanwhile, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and
Oil Red O staining showed excessive lipid accumulation
and hepatic steatosis in db/db mice (Figure 1D).
Interestingly, Western blotting suggested that diglyceride
acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a crucial and terminal enzyme
for triglycerides synthesis, increased significantly in db/db
mice liver (Figure 1E and 1F). However, carnitine
palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT-1A), the essential and
rate-limiting enzyme in the beta-oxidation of long chain
fatty acids, showed no differences between two groups
(Figure 1E and 1F). Consistent with the in vivo study,
increased DGAT1 but unaltered CPT-1A were also observed
in palmitate treated HepG2 cells (Figure 1G and 1H).
All these data can lead to a hypothesis that decreased
miR-30c-5p level might accelerate the abnormal lipid
metabolism of db/db mice.

rAAV-miR-30c-5p attenuated hepatic steatosis in
db/db mice
Compared with C57BL/Ks controls, excessive
lipid accumulation was observed in liver of db/db mice.
rAAV-miR-30c-5p treatment significantly attenuated
hepatic lipid deposition and hepatic steatosis in db/db
mice compared with untreated db/db mice, while rAAVmiR-30c-5p-TUD further aggravated these (Figure 3A
and 3B). Consistent with the data observed in plasma,
hepatic TC remained unaltered with either rAAV-miR30c-5p or rAAV-miR-30c-5p-TUD treatment (Figure 3C).
However, rAAV-miR-30c-5p treatment reduced hepatic
triglyceride accumulation in db/db mice, while rAAV-miR30c-5p-TUD administration aggravated it (Figure 3D).
Further, we analyzed the protein and mRNA
levels of CPT-1A and DGAT1, the crucial enzymes
for triglyceride oxidation and synthesis, respectively.
Interestingly, we observed a significantly decreased
DGAT1 expression in rAAV-miR-30c-5p treated db/db
mice, while CPT-1A remained unaltered among all groups
(Figure 3E–3I).
These data indicated that miR-30c-5p attenuated
hepatic triglyceride accumulation in db/db mice, possibly
by reducing triglyceride synthesis.

rAAV-miR-30c-5p decreased plasma triglyceride
in db/db mice
In order to investigate our hypothesis above, we next
employed the db/db mice model to determine the effects of
miR-30c-5p on NAFLD by using rAAV delivery system.
Twelve-week–old male db/db mice were divided into
4 groups (n = 8 in each) and treated with NS (control
saline), rAAV-miR-30c-5p, rAAV-miR-30c-5p-TUD,
and rAAV-miR-random, respectively, for 12 weeks.
Results showed that hepatic miR-30c-5p was significantly

As expected, increased lipid deposition was observed
in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. Besides, gain/loss-offunction analysis was conducted by transfection of miRNA
mimics or inhibitor. MiR-30c-5p mimics attenuated
palmitate-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, while
miR-30c-5p inhibitor aggravated it (Figure 4A and 4B).
Increased TC was observed in palmitate-treated HepG2
cells, but remained unaltered with either miR-30c-5p mimics
or inhibitor treatment (Figure 4C). More importantly,
palmitate-treated HepG2 with miR-30c-5p transfection

exhibited reduced triglyceride accumulation while miR-30c5p inhibitor treatment aggravated it (Figure 4D).
We detected the protein and mRNA levels of
CPT-1A and DGAT1. We also found that, in vitro,
miR-30c-5p mimics treatment decreased DGAT1
expression, while miR-30c-5p inhibitor increased DGAT1
level. However, bioinformatic prediction and Ago2-RIP
showed that DGAT1 was not a direct target of miR-30c-5p
(Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). Besides, the protein
and mRNA levels of CPT-1A was unaltered among all
groups (Figure 4E–4I).

These findings further indicated that miR-30c-5p
may attenuate triglyceride accumulation by reducing lipid
biosynthesis, but not directly targeting DGAT1.

Tools. As a result, 1564 genes were potential targets of
miR-30c-5p. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis was
applied to the target pool (1564 genes) to better understand
the role of miR-30c-5p. Interestingly, top 8 pathwayssuppressed by miR-30c-5p were fatty acid biosynthesis,
fatty acid metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis,
lysine degradation, oocyte meiosis, mucin type O-Glycan
biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and viral carcinogenesis
(Figure 5A). Specifically, three genes, fatty acid synthase

(FASN), long chain fatty acid CoA ligase 1 m (ACSL1),
and long chain fatty acid CoA ligase (ACSL4) in the fatty
acid biosynthesis pathway (the top 1 predicted pathway)
were suggested as targets of miR-30c-5p.
To determine the putative target of miR-30c-5p,
we performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation with antiAgo2 antibodies and results showed that miR-30c-5p
transfection increased mRNA level of FASN rather
than ACSL1 or ACSL4 (Figure 5B). Moreover, miR30c-5p also showed a potential to target FASN in a
highly conserved region among human, monkey, rat,
and mouse (Figure 5C). In HepG2 cells, miR-30c-5p
transfection decreased FASN level, while knocking
down of endogenous miR-30c-5p showed opposite effect

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 5D and 5E). Western blotting revealed that hepatic
FASN protein level was increased in db/db mice compared
with C57BL/Ks control (Figure 5F and 5G), but rAAV9miR-30c-5p-treatment reduced its expression, while
rAAV9-miR-30c-5p TUD treatment showed the opposite
effect (Figure 5F and 5G).
These data indicated that miR-30c-5p inhibited fatty
acid biosynthesis possibly by suppressing FASN.

cells, siRNAs against FASN (si-FASN-1, si-FASN-2,
si-FASN-3) were transfected into HepG2 cells and more
than 80% FASN was knockdowned at protein level
(Figure 6A and 6B). The knockdown of FASN reversed
lipid deposition and triglyceride accumulation, but TC
level remained unchanged in palmitate treated HepG2
cells (Figure 6C–6F). Furthermore, Western blotting
confirmed a decrease in DGAT1 but not CPT1A in
si-FASN treated HepG2 cells (Figure 6G–6I). These data
indicated that knockdown of FASN attenuated triglyceride

accumulation, which is in consistence with the effects of
miR-30c-5p overexpression.
Furthermore, a model was employed to illustrate
the roles of FASN and miR-30c-5pin hepatic steatosis
(Figure 6J).

of the miR-30c-5p in db/db mice, which contributed to

hepatic steatosis. We found that miR-30c-5p was able
to suppress FASN, the crucial enzyme in fatty acid
biosynthesis and delivery of exogenous miR-30c-5p by
rAAV was sufficient to attenuate triglyceride accumulation
and liver steatosis in the db/db mice, suggesting a new
therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.
Using DIANA-mirPath v3.0 tool, we identified
1564 genes targeted by miR-30c-5p. KEGG analysis of
these target genes further indicated fatty acid biosynthesis
as the most possible pathway inhibited by miR-30c-5p.
Consistent with this pathway analysis, our in vivo and
in vitro study confirmed down-regulation of miR-30c-5p
on fatty acid biosynthesis. Though our KEGG analysis
also revealed other pathways (such as cancer) likely to be
suppressed by miR-30c-5p, the high enrichment score of
fatty acid biosynthesis strongly suggested miR-30c-5p as
a metabolic-related miRNA.
As observed in the present work, augmented
fatty acid biosynthesis leads to hepatic lipid deposition
and steatosis in db/db mice, a classic animal model
for NALFD [16]. Delivery of exogenous miR-30c-5p
efficiently attenuated triglyceride accumulation and
liver steatosis in the db/db mice. We then asked
whether miR-30c-5p was crucial in regulating fatty acid
biosynthesis, as hundreds of other miRNAs might also
suppress this particular pathway. Using the “Reverse
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Search module” of DIANA-mirPath v3.0 tool, 57 miRNAs
were identified to suppress at least 2 genes in the fatty acid
biosynthesis pathway (Supplementary Table 1). Though
miR-30c-5p was just 1 of the 57 fatty acid biosynthesis–
related miRNAs, its high abundance (one of the top 10
highest expressed hepatic miRNAs [17]) may render it as
a more potential regulator compared with other NALFDrelated miRNAs.
FASN, ACSL1 and ACSL4 in the fatty acid
biosynthesis were specifically suggested to be the putative
targets of miR-30c-5p based on bioinformatic analysis,
but Ago2-RIP identified only FASN (but not ACSL1 or
ACSL4) as the putative targets of miR-30c-5p. MiR30c-5p decreased FASN expression and triglyceride
accumulation, while down-regulation of FASN by siRNA
reduced triglyceride accumulation and lipid deposition,
which suggested that miR-30c-5p might attenuate fatty
acid biosynthesis by targeting FASN.
CPT-1A is a essential and rate-limiting enzyme in
the beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, but our results
showed that the protein and mRNA levels of CPT-1A in
the liver of db/db mice and HepG2 cells were unaltered
when miR-30c-5p over-expressed. Previous studies in
humans and rodents have showed that the mechanisms
leading to the excessive triglyceride accumulations in
liver were mainly associated with enhanced delivery of
13459

Oncotarget

plasma none-sterified fatty acid from peripheral tissues to
liver and increased hepatic de novo lipid synthesis, while
lipid degradation was only moderately inhibited through
β-oxidation and secretion of VLDL into plasma [18]. The
present study also indicated that miR-30c-5p reduced novo
lipid synthesis in hepatic steatosis.
DGAT1, which catalyzes the last step in hepatic
triglyceride synthesis, is enriched in human liver and
increased in patients with NAFLD [19, 20]. It aggravates
the development of hepatic steatosis via enhancing
esterification of exogenous fatty acids but not endogenous
fatty acids [21]. This study demonstrated that miR-30c-5p
down-regulated DGAT1 expression and therefore reduced
exogenous fatty acids esterification to prevent hepatic
steatosis. However, another research showed that deficiency
of DGAT1 did not protect db/db mice against hepatic
steatosis, which indicated that excessive triglyceride
accumulations in liver of db/db mice may result from not
only enhanced exogenous, but also endogenous fatty acids
synthesis [22]. Therefore, inhibiting endogenous fatty acids
synthesis may be a potential therapy for hepatic steatosis,
which is supported by our study.
Endogenously-synthesized fatty acids are catalyzed
by the 250-270 kD multifunctional, homodimeric FASN.
FASN synthesizes long-chain fatty acids by using acetylCoA as a primer, malonyl-CoA as a two-carbon donor,
and NADPH as a reducing equivalent. The predominant
product of FASN is a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate
[23–25]. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated
that treatment of FASN inhibitor in obese mice caused
dramatic improvement of hepatic steatosis [26, 27], which
was consistent with our results.
Our data suggested that knockdown of FASN
attenuated triglyceride accumulation in palmitate-treated
HepG2 cells, which was in consistence with the effects of
miR-30c-5p overexpression. The explanation may be as
follows: 1) Exogenous and endogenous palmitate together
contributed to cellular triglyceride accumulation; 2) SiFASN decreased endogenous palmitate synthesis, which
may further lead to attenuated triglyceride synthesis; 3) In
addition to catalyzing palmitate synthesis, FASN may also
inhibit other fatty acid biosynthesis-related enzymes such
as DGAT1 to reduce exogenous fatty acids esterification,
which was observed in our study and previous works [27].
Taken together, miR-30c-5p may attenuate triglyceride
accumulation via FASN or FASN-regulated DGAT1
directly.
rAAV system, with low toxicity and antigenicity,
is a promising vector for gene therapy [12, 28]. Previous
researches showed a preference for liver tissue rAAV9
being clearly superior in terms of transduction efficiency
and transgene expression compared to rAAV2 and
rAAV8 [29] .Thus rAAV9 was used for the delivery of
miR-30c-5p in the present study. However, rAAV delivered
miR-30c-5p also target other organs, such as heart and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kidney, and thus the potential off-target effects of miR-30c5p in the current study could not be completely ruled out.
In summary, our findings reveal an inhibitory
role of miR-30c-5p in NALFD, and its systematic
delivery to animals is sufficient to reduce triglyceride
accumulation and alleviate hepatic steatosis in db/db mice
by reducing both endogenous fatty acids synthesis and
exogenous fatty acids esterification. These observations
provide a theoretical basis for developing miRNA-based
therapeutics against metabolism disorder and associated
diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
HepG2 cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in
DMEM with10% FBS (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
MiRNA mimics, inhibitors, siRNAs, and random small
RNA controls were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All of the small RNAs
used in the present study were purchased from Riobio Co.,
Ltd (Guangzhou, China).

Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein concentrations were determined by the
BCA method. For Western blotting, total cell lysate was
resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane,
and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T. The
membrane was incubated with primary antibody overnight
at 4°C, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 2 hours, and finally developed with the ECL
system (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing,
China). Antibodies used in the present study were from
ABclonal technology (Boston, MA): CPT1A (Catalog No:
A5307), DGAT1 (Catalog No: A6857), FASN (Catalog
No: A6273), and β-actin (Catalog No: AC004). Western
blotting results were quantified by densitometry and
processed with the ImageJ software (National Institutes
of Health software).

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcribed
with First Strand Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR were performed with
the SYBR Green (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
on a 7900HT FAST Real-Time PCR System (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 95°C for 10 min, 40
cycles at 95°C for 15 s in each cycle, and 60°C for
1 min in the final cycle. All reactions were performed in
triplicate. Primers used in the present study were listed
in Supplementary Table 2.

(Abbott Laboratories). TC and triglyceride in liver or
HepG2 cells were detected by GRO-PAP method (Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).

Lysed cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with
anti-Ago2 antibody (Abnova Corporation, Taiwan, China)
or IgG (Santa CruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using
protein G Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), as described [30]. After elution from
the beads, bound RNA were extracted with TRIzol and
quantified by real time RT-PCR.

MiRNA targets and pathway analysis
DIANA-mirPath v3.0, a miRNA pathway analysis
web-server, was utilized for target prediction of miR-30c5p. MirPath can utilize predicted miRNA targets (in 3’
UTR regions) provided by the experimentally validated
miRNA interactions derived from DIANA-TarBase v7.0.
These interactions can be subsequently combined with
sophisticated merging and meta-analysis algorithms [31].
Furthermore, the KEGG analysis was performed for
pathway analysis of all miR-30c-5p targets.

Construction of rAAV
rAAV (type 9) containing miR-30c-5p, miR-30c-5pTUD, or miR-random were prepared by triple plasmid cotransfection in HEK293T cells, respectively, as previously
described [28, 30].

Statistics

Animals

All data are presented as mean ± SEM. The
Student’s t test and ANOVA were performed, to determine
statistically significant differences among treatment
groups, as appropriate. In all cases, a value of p < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.

All experiments were performed with the approval
of the Animal Research Committee of Tongji Medical
College, and in accordance with ARRIVE and NIH
guidelines for animal welfare. For in vivo experiments,
male db/db mice on C57BL/Ks background and control
C57BL/Ks mice (Model Animal Research Center of
Nanjing University, Nanjing, China) were used. All
the animals were maintained with 12-h light/12-h dark
photoperiods with free access to water and food. We
randomly divided db/db mice into four groups (control,
rAAV-miR-random, rAAV-miR-30c and rAAV-antimiR-30c, n ≥ 8 each group). They were injected with
corresponding rAAVs via tail vein at the age of 12 weeks.
All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital
anesthesia to minimize suffering. Through intraperitoneal
injections of a ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine
(5 mg/kg) mixture, anaesthetization of mice was
performed. To assess the adequacy of anesthesia
during hemodynamic examinations, parameters such
as responsiveness, blood pressure, respiratory and heart
rates were monitored. Then they were sacrificed by CO2
inhalation after the surgical procedures. The rAAV-treated
db/db and control C57BL/Ks mice were sacrificed at
24 weeks and tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen or collected for paraffin embedding.
