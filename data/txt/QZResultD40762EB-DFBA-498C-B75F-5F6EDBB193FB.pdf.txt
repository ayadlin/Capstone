ABSTRACT
Attempts to directly block the mutant neuroblastoma rat sarcoma oncogene
(NRAS) protein, a driving mutation in many cancer types, have been unsuccessful.
Current treatments focus on inhibition of different components of NRAS’ two main
downstream cascades: PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK. Here we test a novel dual therapy
combination of metformin and trametinib on a panel of 16 NRAS mutant cell lines,
including melanoma cells, melanoma cells with acquired trametinib resistance, lung
cancer and neuroblastoma cells. We show that both of the main downstream cascades
of NRAS can be blocked by this combination: metformin indirectly inhibits the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway and trametinib directly impedes the MAPK pathway. This dual
therapy synergistically reduced cell viability in vitro and xenograft tumor growth
in vivo. We conclude that metformin and trametinib combinations are effective in
preclinical models and may be a possible option for treatment of NRAS mutant cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Given the activation and the crosstalk of MAPK and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in NRAS mutant tumors, and
the development of resistance to monotherapies, there is
a strong rationale for a dual pathway inhibition. Various
inhibitor combinations have shown preclinical efficacy
and are currently being evaluated in trials [5,9,10,12–14].
So far, the outcomes are only modest and the use of such
combinations is partly limited by serious adverse events
[15–17].
On the other hand, colleagues report encouraging
preliminary results on trials testing metformin alone or
in combination with vemurafenib in BRAFV600 mutant
melanoma (NCT01840007; NCT01638676) [18].
Metformin is a biguanide which has been used as an oral
anti-diabetic drug for decades and has a well-known safety
profile. In addition to its effects on glucose metabolism,
it ultimately inhibits mTOR in cancer cells and leads
to growth arrest and apoptosis [19,20]. Retrospective
studies report a decrease in cancer risk and lower cancer
mortality in diabetic patients treated with metformin

Mutations in the neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral
oncogene (NRAS) play an important role in cancer. NRAS
mutations are found in 15-20% of malignant melanomas,
but also in several other cancer types [1–5]. These point
mutations usually affect codons 12, 13 (Exon I) and 61
(Exon II) of the NRAS gene. The mutant NRAS protein
constitutively activates downstream signaling cascades
such as the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ral pathways,
resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor
growth [1,6,7]. Attempts to directly inhibit mutant NRAS
have been unsuccessful so far. Treatment approaches use
small molecule inhibitors which interfere with NRAS
downstream pathways [8–10]. Mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors block signaling through
the MAPK pathway and NRAS mutated tumors are
associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy [11]. The MEK
inhibitor trametinib has shown clinical efficacy in patients
with NRAS mutant cancers [9].

[21–24]. A recent meta-analysis includes 65,540 cancer
cases in diabetic patients and shows that the cancer
incidence and mortality in those taking metformin was
reduced. However, the authors state that the results
varied significantly across studies and that prospective
studies in non-diabetic patients are needed to understand
metformin’s effect on cancer [25].
Consequently, we explore if metformin could
be a potential partner of trametinib for the treatment of
NRAS mutant tumors. The combination would lead to a
desirable dual pathway inhibition. We use a large panel of
NRAS mutant melanoma, neuroblastoma and lung cancer
cell lines. We show that the combination of metformin
and trametinib has a synergistic effect in NRAS mutant

tumors and reduces tumor size in a xenograft model. In
addition, we investigate the effect of metformin on two
NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired resistance
to trametinib.

RESULTS
Effects of metformin and trametinib on NRAS

To evaluate the response of NRAS mutant melanoma
to metformin and trametinib, we first performed CTG-cell

viability assays. We incubated a panel of 10 cell lines
with previously characterized mutations [12] with the
respective drugs and their combinations. The cell lines,
their mutations and GI50 values (concentrations of drugs
resulting in 50% decrease in cell viability relative to
controls) for the single agent drugs are reported in Table
1. The GI50 values in treatment-naïve melanoma cells
ranged from 3.39 to 14.45mM with an average value
of 7.11mM for metformin and from 0.67 to >100nM
for trametinib. All cell lines showed more cell viability
decrease when the drugs were combined (Figure 1A).
To analyze whether the combination leads to
inhibition of cell proliferation or cell death, we studied
the induction of apoptosis or necrosis by staining the
cells with Annexin V/Propidium Iodide assay followed
by flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S1). These
assays also served as a control to the CTG assay, which
measures total ATP levels in cells and might report
incorrect measurements of cell viability, especially when
mitochondrial complex I inhibitors like metformin are
used. The apoptosis assays showed that the combination
leads to cell death and they confirmed the synergistic
results of the CTG assays.
To quantify the effect of the combination, we used
Calcusyn software to calculate the combination index
(CI) for all melanoma cell lines. The CI values ranged
from 0.25 for MaMel27II to 0.98 for WM1366 (Figure
1B). Most cell lines had a CI index between 0.3 and 0.7
indicating synergism according to the method of ChouTalalay [26]. The combination showed an additive effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cell lines MM415 and WM1366 who had a CI index
above 0.9. No cell line showed an antagonistic effect to
the combination therapy.
Next, we analyzed the effect of the drugs and
their combinations on the two main NRAS downstream
signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR.
Metformin showed an effect on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway, where it inhibited the phosphorylation of S6
in a dose-dependent manner. In cell lines DO4 and
MM415 metformin also inhibited AKT phosphorylation.
Trametinib led to an inhibition of ERK phosphorylation
in all cell lines tested. The combination of metformin
and trametinib suppressed the phosphorylation of NRAS
effector proteins ERK and S6, providing an explanation of
the effects on cell viability (Figure 1C).

Effects of metformin and trametinib on nonmelanoma NRAS mutant lung cancer and
neuroblastoma
Since NRAS shares signaling similarities across
different malignancies, we hypothesized that the effects
of the combination might be translated to NRAS mutant
cancers other than melanoma [10]. For these experiments
we used two neuroblastoma and two lung cancer cell lines
with known NRASQ61 mutations and dependency on NRAS
signaling [10]. Metformin and trametinib had comparable
effects on cell viability and pathway inhibition as in NRAS
mutant melanoma cell lines (Figure 2 A,B).

Effects of metformin and trametinib on a human
melanoma xenograft model

Resistance to single agent inhibitors, such as
trametinib, is a growing concern. Metformin decreased
cell viability in cell lines WM3670 and MaMel27II with
relatively innate trametinib resistances (Table 1, Figure
1A). Therefore, we tested metformin on trametinibresistant cell lines DO4-RM and MM415-RM, where
it decreased cell viability in both clones. The analysis
of NRAS downstream effector proteins showed a dosedependent decrease of AKT or S6 phosphorylation (Figure
3 A,B).

Given the promising in vitro results, we examined
the effect of the combination in a xenograft model. Human
DO4 cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice,
and gave rise to tumors in 1-2 weeks. Treatment with
either metformin or trametinib decelerated tumor growth
compared to vehicle treated controls. Combination therapy
led to less tumor growth compared to single-drug therapy
and vehicle treated controls. (Figure 4A).
The difference in relative tumor volumes was
statistically significant comparing the combination group
with the three other groups (vehicle, metformin only,
trametinib only) on days 15 and 22 after treatment began

NRAS mutant cancers [30–32,39]. As previously shown,
all NRAS mutant cells used in this study depend upon
the NRAS mutation. Still, variations to what extent the
typical downstream cascades of mutant NRAS account
for survival and proliferation exist. This might, at least in
part, explain the observed differences in sensitivity to the
inhibitory agents used in this study.
Mutant NRAS constitutively signals through the
MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, among others.
Mounting evidence suggests that dual inhibition of both
pathways may lead to better results in NRAS mutant
cancer [10,12,14] . NRAS mutations are associated with
MEK inhibitor efficacy and first clinical results with MEK
inhibitors show a response rate of 20% in patients with
advanced NRAS mutant melanoma [11,40]. Here, we show
that metformin and trametinib synergistically decrease
cell viability in a large survey of NRAS mutant melanoma,
lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines, including two
cell lines with acquired trametinib resistance. The finding
of synergism in different cancer types with activating
NRAS mutations is not surprising, because NRAS mutant
melanoma, lung cancer and neuroblastoma all seem to
depend on NRAS downstream signaling through MAPK
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR [3,10]. Trametinib inhibits the
MAPK pathway while metformin inhibits the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway. The combination of the two produces
a synergistic effect because they lead to dual pathway
inhibition of NRAS’s important signaling pathways.
Our immunoblots verified the dual pathway inhibition
by the combination, and showed a reduction in NRAS
downstream cascade effector proteins p-AKT, p-S6, and
p-ERK.
Resistance to targeted inhibitors is a growing
concern in the field of oncology, and multiple mechanisms
of such resistance are known [41–43]. We show the effect
of metformin on cells with an acquired resistance to
trametinib and hypothesize that its addition to trametinib
might delay or reverse the development of resistance.
Blocking targets in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by
different drugs can reverse resistance to inhibitors of
MAPK signaling cascade components, as shown by other
authors in melanoma [44].
Certain questions should be addressed before
metformin is used in combination therapy on patients.
Metformin doses used in in vitro studies are higher than
serum levels observed in diabetic patients (1 to 20umol/L)
[45]. Yet, retrospective epidemiologic studies and metaanalyses still showcase the anti-tumor effects of metformin
[22–25,46]. A possible explanation of the in vivo effect
of the drug is the accumulation of positively charged
metformin in certain tissues and within the mitochondria.
This can lead to local concentrations >1000 fold higher
than the serum levels [47–49]. Also, the mechanism of
metformin’s in vivo effects has not been fully understood.
Beyond the blockage of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway, metformin could interfere with insulin signaling

(p<.05; ANOVA, Bonferroni correction). However, there
was no significant difference in tumor suppression when
comparing the two single treatment groups with each
other (p=0.578, day 15; p=1.0, day22). Target inhibition
was assessed by immunoblotting of xenograft tumor
tissue. The combination treatment suppressed NRAS
downstream effectors more potently than single-drug
treatment. Additionally, the combination of metformin and
trametinib caused an induction of the pro-apoptotic protein
BIM (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of
having certain cancers [27]. However, diabetic patients
who take the blood glucose lowering metformin have
lower cancer incidence, lower cancer related mortality, and
lower risk of cancer development, compared to diabetics
treated with other agents [18,21]. In one prospective trial
metformin reduced the number of pre-cancerous lesions in
the rectum, suggesting a preventive role of metformin in
the development of rectal cancer [28].
The biguanide metformin is widely prescribed and
has a well-known safety profile. In cancer cells, metformin
interferes with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and
indirectly inhibits mTOR. It leads to cell cycle arrest,
increased apoptosis and autophagy [18–20,29]. This
makes metformin an attractive candidate for the treatment
of NRAS mutant cancer, where the constitutively active
NRAS signals through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
This study evaluates the effects of the combination
of metformin and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in NRAS
mutant cancer. We focus our efforts on NRAS mutant
melanoma, but also show that the same principles
apply in other cancers with known oncogenic NRAS
mutations. NRAS mutations are rare in lung cancer and
neuroblastoma. However, the high prevalence of these
tumors makes their NRAS mutant form clinically very
relevant [10].
Several studies report inhibitory effects in different
cancer types using AMPK activators like metformin,
AICAR or phenformin, alone or in combination with
other drugs such as erolotinib or dasatinib [30–38].
Whether BRAFV600 mutant and NRAS mutant melanoma
cells have differing sensitivities to metformin is a matter
of debate. While some authors show that the induction
of autophagy and apoptosis is independent of the BRAF
or NRAS mutation status of cells, others report that
metformin increases tumor growth of BRAF mutated
melanoma xenografts by up-regulation of VEGF-A
and induction of angiogenesis [30–32]. In our hands,
metformin inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in
NRAS mutant melanoma, neuroblastoma and lung cancer
with GI50 values ranging between 1.11mM and 29.9mM
(Table 1, Figure 1). Our results are supported by other
studies, strengthening the rationale for metformin use in

and lower serum glucose [27,50,51]. Here, immunoblots
of xenograft tumors showed some blockage of NRAS
downstream pathways when metformin was used.
Combination therapy on mouse xenograft tumors showed
tumor volumes significantly lower than those of the control
and single treatment groups for the entirety of treatment,
but we could not abolish tumor growth completely with
either treatment.
Further studies are needed to elucidate the in vivo
action of metformin, but our study provides evidence
that a combination of metformin and trametinib may be
a possible option for treatment of NRAS mutant cancers.

Trametinib and metformin were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, Texas, USA). For cell
viability assays, cells were plated in 96-well plates with a
density of 4000-8000 cells per well and incubated for 24
h at 37 °C with 5% C02. Then cells were incubated with
increasing drug concentrations and their combinations.
Cell viability was measured with the CellTiter-Glo (CTG)
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Madison,
Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Luminescence was measured on the SynergyHT
plate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA) using Gen5 software
(Version 1.11.5). For apoptotic assays, cells were plated
in 12-well plates and treated with DMSO, trametinib,
metformin or combinations. After 72hrs apoptosis was
assessed using the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin
V Alexa Fluor 488 & Propidium Iodide according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen; V13241) with the
AccuriC6 Flow Cytometer using the CFlow software
(Version 1.0.227.4).

METHODS
Cell lines, cell culture
Human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines
DO4, MM415, MM485, SK-MEL-2, MaMel30I and
MaMel27II were a generous gift from Boris Bastian at
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); cell
lines WM1366 (Cat N. WC00078), WM3629 (Cat N.
WC00117), WM3670 (Cat N. WC00119) and WM3060
(Cat N. WC00126) were obtained from Coriell Institute
(Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA). NRAS mutant
lung carcinoma cell lines SW1271, NCI-H2347 and
neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-AS and CHP212 were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(Oct/2013). Cell lines were not authenticated by short
tandem repeat DNA profiling after purchase, but were
regularly tested for NRAS mutation status.
Cell lines DO4, MM415, MM485, SK-MEL-2,
MaMel30I, MaMel27II, SW1271, NCI-H2347, SK-NAS and CHP212 were cultured in RPMI-1640 media
supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS); cell lines WM1366, WM3629,
WM3670 and WM3060 were cultured in MCDB153
media supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) Leibovitz’s L-15
media, 2% (vol/vol) FBS, and 1.68 mM CaCl2. All cell
lines were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

GI50 values, Combination index
Concentrations of drugs resulting in 50% decrease
in cell viability relative to controls (GI50) as well as the
combination index (CI) were calculated using CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK; Version 2.1).
According to the recommendation of Chou-Talalay, a CI
<0.9 indicated synergistic effects of drugs; the synergism
was further refined as: slight synergism (CI=0.85-0.9),
moderate synergism (CI=0.7-0.85), synergism (CI=0.30.7) , strong synergism (CI=0.1-0.3) and very strong
synergism (CI<0.1) [26].

Western Blotting
Cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), lysed using radio-immunoprecipitation
(RIPA) buffer [150mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/
vol) SDS] in 50mM Tris HCl (pH8.0) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce, IL, USA;
78442). Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce; 23225) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Proteins were separated by SDSPAGE with 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
CA, USA; 456-1096), transferred to an Immobilon-P
PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA, USA; IPVH00010),
and blocked in 5% dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline, with
Tween 20 (TBST) (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were
incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and
target proteins were detected with ECL detection reagent
(Pierce; 32106). β-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich) served as a

were selected for and further propagated. The established
resistant cell lines were termed DO4-RM and MM415RM were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented
with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 5nM or 55nM trametinib,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S2).

Tumor xenografts in nude mice
Six-week-old female CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu mice
(Taconic Farms, USA; weight 20-25g) were injected
subcutaneously with 6 x 106 DO4 cells re-suspended in
200ul Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA). Treatment was
started when tumors reached approximately 100mm3.
Mice were treated once daily, five days per week, with
either oral vehicle (methylcellulose 0.5%, Tween80
0.2%; oral gavage), trametinib (2mg/kg/day, oral gavage),
D-PBS (200ul; intraperitoneal injection) or metformin
(200mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal injection). The change in
tumor size was measured with calipers every 2-4 days,
and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula
V=π x a x b x c x 4/3. After 22 days of treatment mice
were euthanized. Tumors were collected, pulverized in
liquid nitrogen, lysed and subjected to western blotting
as described above. All mouse studies were approved by
the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(Protocol # AN086990-03A).
