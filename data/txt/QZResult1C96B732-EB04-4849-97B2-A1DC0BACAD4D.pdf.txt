ABSTRACT
Autophagy is the basic catabolic mechanism that involves cell degradation of
unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components. Autophagy has a controversial
role in cancer – both in protecting against tumor progression by isolation of damaged
organelles, or by potentially contributing to cancer growth. The impact of autophagy
in RAS induced transformation still remains to be further analyzed based on the
differential effect of RAS isoforms and tumor cell context. In the present study, the
effect of KRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA oncogenic pathways on the autophagic cell properties
and on main components of the autophagic machinery like p62 (SQSTM1), Beclin-1
(BECN1) and MAP1LC3 (LC3) in colon cancer cells was investigated. This study
provides evidence that BRAF oncogene induces the expression of key autophagic
markers, like LC3 and BECN1 in colorectal tumor cells. Herein, PI3K/AKT/MTOR
inhibitors induce autophagic tumor properties, whereas RAF/MEK/ERK signalling
inhibitors reduce expression of autophagic markers. Based on the ineffectiveness
of BRAFV600E inhibitors in BRAFV600E bearing colorectal tumors, the BRAF related
autophagic properties in colorectal cancer cells are further exploited, by novel
combinatorial anti-cancer protocols. Strong evidence is provided here that pretreatment of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA followed by its combination with BRAFV600E
targeting drug PLX4720 can synergistically sensitize resistant colorectal tumors.
Notably, colorectal cancer cells are very sensitive to mono-treatments of another
autophagy inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1. The findings of this study are expected to provide
novel efficient protocols for treatment of otherwise resistant colorectal tumors bearing
BRAFV600E, by exploiting the autophagic properties induced by BRAF oncogene.

frequent BRAFV600E mutation is a single substitution at
nucleotide 1796. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is
another well-studied RAS effector. PI3K family members
play an important role as mediators of RAS-regulated cell
survival and proliferation. When PI3K is active, it can
trigger cell growth, cell cycle entry, and/or cell survival
through phosphorylation of AKT [1, 2]. Most KRAS
and BRAF mutations enhance their ability to directly

phosphorylate MEK. The role of RAS and PI3K signalling
pathways has been analysed in regulating the autophagic
process in different systems, although key mechanisms are
still under investigation.
Autophagy is a housekeeping survival mechanism
with a protective function against stress conditions where
the cells start to digest their own cellular components
[3]. In tumors, this self-cannibalization process is
stimulated by metabolic stress (e.g., nutrient/growth factor
deprivation, hypoxia, and acidosis), cellular damage, or
inhibition of pro-survival signals caused by anticancer
therapies [4]. Through autophagy cancer cells utilize a
highly plastic and dynamic mechanism to either repress
initial steps of carcinogenesis, or support the survival and
growth of established tumors [5, 6].
BECN1, rarely mutated in tumors [20], and LC3
proteins are two key components of the autophagic
process. Precisely, LC3-BI is converted to LC3-BII
through lipidation by an ubiquitin-like system involving
ATG7 and ATG3 that allows LC3 to become associated
with autophagic vesicles. p62 (SQSTM1) is thought
to be another critical protein that targets other proteins
for proteasome degradation or autophagic digestion, at
the crossroads of autophagy, apoptosis and cancer. In
particular, LC3-II binds p62 to regulate protein packaging
and delivery to the autophagosome [3]. Both the presence
of LC3 in autophagosomes and the conversion of LC3
to the lower migrating form, LC3-II, have been used as
indicators of autophagy [3, 7]. Mammalian BECN1,
also known as autophagy-related gene (ATG6), has
been shown to interact with BCL-2 and BCL2L1 [8].
Furthermore, BECN1 and its binding partner PIK3C3,
also known as Vps34, are required for the initiation of the
autophagosome formation. On the other hand, the MTOR
signaling pathway downstream of AKT, is a critical
regulator of autophagy. Activation of MTOR can inhibit
the autophagic process [9].
Previous studies propose that mutant RAS oncogene
can prevent the autophagophore formation through
downregulation of BECN1 and thus, can promote the
anchorage-independent growth of malignant cells through
a mechanism that involves down-regulation of BECN1
[10]. In other studies, mutant HRAS has been shown
to induce autophagic traits [11]and cell death through
autophagy or RAS was shown to promote autophagic
cell death [12]. Other studies argue that hypoxic regions
of established tumors by activated RAS present high
autophagic activity, through which cells can survive under
stressful conditions [13]. Most important, the putative
association of activated BRAF to autophagy has not yet
been analyzed in detail.
The hypothesis of the controversial role of
autophagy in tumorigenesis and survival is supported in a
number of studies [19]: while some studies have suggested
a tumor suppressive role for autophagy [14–16] and the
inactivation of autophagy-related genes in certain human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers [17], others have reported the opposite. According
to this, tumor cells were found to exhibit high basal
levels of autophagy required for cancer cell proliferation
[13, 18].
Recent developments in the investigation of
autophagy as a mechanism of resistance to many
anticancer drugs and the development of strategies to
inhibit autophagy represent a new approach to enhance
the efficacy of cancer therapy [21]. Current inhibitors
of autophagy, like 3-MA, Bafilomycin, (hydroxyl)
chloroquine as well as new agents-modulators of
autophagy, are currently tested as anti-cancer agents, either
alone, or in rational combinatorial treatments with targeted
anti-cancer drugs [22]. These recent findings confirm the
urgent need for further investigation into the relation
between autophagy, tumorigenesis and tumor survival,
since these may also be dependent on the cell type, tumor
stage and environmental conditions [23].
The specific BRAFV600E inhibitors vemurafenib
[27] and dabrafenib accomplish relatively short periods
of antitumor activity before the appearance of resistance
and treatment failure. A number of different mechanisms
that may contribute to tumor resistance to drug therapy
have been proposed, including a feedback re-activation of
EGFR in colorectal cancer [24-26, 28-30]. Several studies
and clinical trials in various cancer types have long been
focusing on combining specific BRAFV600E inhibitors
with other kinase or receptor growth factor inhibitors,
like MEK, PI3K and EGFR [31-33, 44]. Towards this
end, combined inhibition of autophagy and oncogenic
BRAF may be particularly efficient, as BRAF-driven
tumors induce and require mitochondrial metabolism, and
therefore may need autophagy to supply substrates, such
as glutamine, to replenish TCA cycle intermediates and to
eliminate damaged mitochondria [34].
In the present study, the role of autophagy in
RAS and BRAF induced transformation was examined
in colon cancer cell lines. Both stimulation of LC3
expression and formation of autophagic vacuoles
in mutant BRAFV600E cell lines are presented.
Furthermore, the MEK/ERK pathway can increase the
protein levels of LC3, unlike the AKT/MTOR pathway,
which has been shown to abolish the autophagic process.
Notably, Bafilomycin A1, a potent autophagy inhibitor
can cause remarkable apoptotic cancer cell death, as
mono-treatment. It is shown here that by using specific
autophagy inhibitors not only cancer cell proliferation
rate can be reduced, but the otherwise resistant mutant
BRAF colon cell lines to targeted BRAF agents, like
PLX4720 (Vemurafenib), can be sensitised to apoptosis
in a synergistic manner. This study proposes a promising
rational combinatorial treatment using BRAF and
autophagy inhibitors that will potentially provide
efficient therapeutic protocols for these otherwise
untreatable tumors, yet to be further tested in vivo.

RESULTS

staining of autophagic vacuoles in colon cancer cell lines
was revealed. In detail, protein levels of the autophagic
marker LC3 (I and II) were found elevated in DLD-1 (lane
1), HCT116 (lane 2) and RKO (lane 4) cells, while lower
was the expression in SW620 (lane 3) and Colo-205 (lane
5) adenocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, LC3 staining
revealed also high protein distribution in DLD-1 (Figure
1B(ii)). The ratio between LC3II and LC3I protein levels
was notably higher in DLD-1 and HT29 as compared to the
other cell lines. The levels of BECN1 were found elevated
only in HCT116 and SW620 cell lines, whereas the ratio
between LC3II/LC3I was low. The flux of autophagy was
also examined through Western blot analysis of p62 protein
levels, which were found elevated in DLD-1 and Colo-

Steady levels of autophagic markers in basic
colon adenocarcinoma cell lines
Different colon adenocarcinoma cell lines were
examined with respect to autophagic properties. In all cell
lines, presence of autophagy was tested through the relative
levels of LC3II using western blot (Figure 1A, lanes 1-6) and
then confirmed with MDC staining- a molecule that stains
autophagic vacuoles. Phalloidin was used for cytoskeleton
staining, in order to assess the number of cells present in
each sample (Figure 1B(i)). A strong association between

markers BECN1 and LC3, as well as those of p62 were analyzed in the above cell lines (A, D).

to the other cell lines (Figure 1A). Alongside, mRNA level
analysis, showed higher than 3-fold mRNA LC3 expression
in DLD-1, Colo-205, SW620 and RKO, as compared to
Caco-2 intermediate colon adenoma cells. The mRNA levels
of BECN1 were found increased by at least 2-fold in DLD-1,
SW620, Colo-205 and HT29 as compared to Caco-2 (Figure
1C). Notably, RKO, HCT116 and SW620 cell lines exhibit
properties of Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT)
phenotype. These results propose a putative relation between
autophagy and the EMT cell programs.
Therefore, the protein levels of autophagic markers
BECN1 and LC3 are overexpressed in selected colon
adenocarcinoma cell lines. HT29 and SW620 cell lines
show induced autophagic properties as revealed by high
MDC staining and low p62 protein levels.

contributes to the hypothesis of a potential correlation of
EMT and autophagy (Figure 1D).
These data suggest that KRAS over-expression
induces the autophagic properties in colorectal cancer
cells. It is also evident that KRAS and HRAS oncogenes
differentially regulate autophagic cell properties in the
examined colorectal cancer cells.

BRAFV600E induces the expression of
autophagic markers BECN1 and LC3.
Association of BRAFV600E with autophagy
In RKO and Colo-205 cell lines bearing
BRAFV600E, protein levels of the autophagic markers
BECN1 and LC3 were high. Activity of MEK/ERK
signalling pathway was also shown to be associated to
the expression of these autophagic markers (Figure 2A,
lanes 1-3). As an additional confirmation, MDC staining
revealed the presence of autophagic vacuoles in a high
percentage of phalloidin stained cells (Figure 2B(i)).
Staining of these cell lines with LC3 antibody under
confocal microscope, showed a high number of dispersed
LC3 punkta around the nucleus, which were more intense
in Colo-205 (Figure 2B(ii)). Thus, presence of autophagy
was obvious in all three BRAFV600E cell lines.
In order to further analyze the putative induction
of autophagy by BRAFV600E, cell lines stably overexpressing BRAFV600E in Caco-2 cells (Caco-BR13
and Caco-BR23) were examined (Figure 2C, lanes 1-3).
BRAFV600E induced MEK/ERK signalling pathway
activity in Caco-BR compared to the parental Caco-2 cells
and was associated with elevated protein expression levels
of autophagic markers BECN1 and LC3, in particular
of LC3II, as shown by Western blot (W.B.) analysis
(Figure 2C, lanes 1-3). Additional evidence for the role
of BRAFV600E in autophagy was provided from parallel
experiments: In RKOshBR2 and RKOshBR10 cells
developed after silencing of BRAFV600E in RKO cell
line, MEK/ERK signalling pathway was suppressed and
the protein levels of autophagic markers BECN1 and LC3
were decreased by W.B. analysis, as compared to parental
RKO (Figure 2C, lanes 4-7). Furthermore, p62 protein
levels were found increased in RKOshBR10 cell line. In
all cell lines, changes in autophagy were shown through
LC3II/LC3I ratio by W.B. analysis (Figure 2A, C) and were
further confirmed with MDC staining shown by confocal
microscopy (Figure 2B(i), 2D). In general, in BRAFV600E
cell lines with high LC3II/LC3I ratio, more MDC stained
vacuoles were detected (Figure 2D). These results reveal
a possible interaction between BRAFV600E induced
tumor properties, MEK signalling and autophagy. These
findings were examined in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer
specimens. Notably, three out of four tumor (75%) clinical
samples bearing BRAFV600E have shown high mRNA
expression of BECN1 and LC3 with respect to the matched

KRAS and HRAS oncogenes differentially
regulate the autophagic markers p62,
LC3 and BECN1
Since autophagic markers are differentially expressed
in colorectal cell lines bearing KRAS or BRAF mutations, as
shown in Figure 1A, the impact of either KRAS or BRAF, as
well as that of HRAS oncogenes on autophagy was further
examined. In Caco-K cell line (Figure 1D, lane 2), generated
after stable ectopic over- expression of KRAS oncogene in
Caco-2 cells [36], the protein levels of autophagic markers
BECN1 and LC3 are lower in comparison to the parental
Caco-2 cells. On the contrary though, in Caco-K cells
the ratio between LC3 II and LC3I is elevated, while p62
protein levels are reduced, indicating an over-activation
of the autophagic machinery, as compared to the parental
Caco-2 cells. As a further confirmation for the induction of
autophagy, the number of MDC stained vacuoles increased
(Figure 1E(i), 2nd column). On the other hand, in Caco-H2
cell line generated after stable over-expression of HRAS
oncogene in Caco-2 cells, BECN1 expression was 20%
higher and the total amount of LC3 was lower as compared
to parental Caco-2 cells. The ratio between LC3II and LC3I
was also lower, while p62 protein levels were not affected
(Figure 1D) by mtHRAS. Furthermore, in DKO4 (lane 5) and
HKE3 (lane 7) cell lines (generated after specific knock-out
of mtKRAS in DLD1 (lane 4) and HCT116 (lane 6) cells
respectively), LC3II levels were higher than parental DLD-1
and HCT116 cells respectively, but LC3B staining was
reduced in these cell lines (Figure 1E(ii)). p62 and BECN1
protein levels (Figure 1D), as well as the number of MDC
stained autophagic vacuoles did not change significantly
(Data not shown). Thus, deletion of activated KRAS
oncogene did not affect the autophagic properties of the
cells, as detected by western blot and immunofluorescence.

bearing colon cancer cell lines (Figure 3A, lanes 3, 7,
11), which was accompanied by a remarkable reduction
of autophagic markers expression, particularly in LC3II
(Figure 3A, 3D). Treatment of BRAFV600E bearing
colon cells with PLX4720 had a more profound effect on
MEK/ERK activity and autophagic properties than MEK
inhibitor treatment (Figure 3A, lanes 2, 6, 10). On the
opposite, p62 protein levels were elevated after treatment
of RKO with PLX4720 or PD0325901, indicating
suppression of autophagy. Remarkably, p62 levels in Colo205 were reduced after treatment with these BRAF/MEK
inhibitors, following the reduction in total LC3 levels
(Figure 3D). The inhibition of autophagy through MEK/
ERK pathway was also confirmed by reduction in MDCvacuole-staining after treatment of BRAFV600E colon
cancer cell lines with PLX4720 and PD0325901 under
confocal microscopy (Figure 3B, HT29 and Figure 3E).
Finally, MEK inhibitor treatment resulted in an average
36% reduction of autophagic vacuole formation in RKO
(Figure 3E), confirming the western blot analysis results
presented in Figure 3A and 3D. The level of MEK/ERK
pathway inhibition shown in Figure 3A was also correlated
with the reduction in the number of autophagic vacuoles as
shown in Figures 3B and 3E.
The effect of BRAF and MEK inhibitors on cell
viability and apoptosis in all three BRAFV600E colon
cancer cell lines was examined next. In accordance to their
effect on MEK pathway inhibition, presented in Figure 3A,
PD0325901 was more efficient than PLX4720 in reducing
cell viability in all three BRAFV600E colon cancer cell
lines RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 after 24, 48 and 72 h
treatments (Figure 3C). Treatment with MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 had a similar effect on cell viability on all
three BRAFV600E colon cancer cell lines, and the same
was true for BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. On the other hand,
treatment with MEK inhibitor resulted in the appearance
of apoptotic markers, like cleaved Caspase-3 in HT29
(Sup. Figure 1, column 4, middle panel), and apoptotic
Hoechst-stained nuclei in RKO (Figure 3C,upper right

AKT and MTOR
We initially examined the effect of BRAF/MEK
and PI3K/MTOR pathway inhibitors on cell signaling
and autophagy of BRAFV600E bearing colorectal cancer
cell lines (Figure 3A,3B, 3D), in order to have a first
indication on the potential regulation of autophagy by
these two pathways. Then, we aimed to detect the role
of autophagy on apoptosis by inhibiting either MEK or
PI3K: Analysis of cell viability, autophagy and apoptosis
after cell treatments with a number of BRAF/MEK and
PI3K/MTOR inhibitors on BRAFV600E cell lines was
performed (Figure 3C, 3E). Finally, the comparative
induction of autophagy by different PI3K/MTOR
inhibitors in non-BRAFV600E cell lines was further
examined (Figure 3F–3G).

BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibition
The hypothesis of MEK/ERK regulated autophagy
was further tested. MEK/ERK pathway was inhibited in
three cell lines with mutant BRAFV600E (RKO, HT29
and Colo-205) after treatment with 1μM of PLX4720
(specific BRAFV600E inhibitor) (Figure 3A, lanes 2, 6,
10) and 1μM of PD0325901 (MEK inhibitor) (Figure 3A,
lanes 3, 7, 11) for 24 h. The total number of cells was
measured either by phalloidin or by Hoechst staining,
as indicated. Treatment with MEK inhibitor PD0325901
markedly reduced MEK/ERK activity in BRAFV600E

any Caspase-3 cleavage in Colo-205 cells (Sup. Figure
2, columns 2 and 4 respectively, middle panel) under the
same treatment conditions. Staining of RKO with LC3
antibody under confocal microscope revealed a scatterned
staining pattern of this protein both in treated and untreated
cells, though in a number of cells the staining was more
compact and intense. Interestingly, treatment with BRAF
and MEK inhibitors reduced the number of cells with high
concentrated LC3 staining (Sup. Figure 3).

though DLD-1 control cells show high levels of LC3
stained aggregates (Figure 3G, 1st coloumn, 3rd row). On
the contrary, inhibition of only one component of PI3K
pathway using GDC0941 or Rapamycin was not sufficient
to trigger these responses in the same cell lines, although
in all Rapamycin-treated cell lines, p62 protein levels
were significantly decreased (Figure 3F). Interestingly,
in DLD-1 cells, treatment with GDC0941 or Rapamycin
resulted in a significant reduction in highy-LC3 stained
cells, confirming also the results of the WB, shown in
Figure 3F. In HCT116 cells, none of the three inhibitors
was able to drive LC3I to LC3II conversion in WB (Figure
3F), although PI-103 or Rapamycin treatment reduced the
number of cells with highly concentrated LC3 staining
(Data not shown). Levels of pAKT (ser473) and pS6R
are shown to confirm inhibition of the related signalling
pathway after treatment with PI3K/MTOR inhibitors
(Figure 3F).
Taking the above under consideration, τhe MEK/
ERK signalling pathway positively regulates autophagic
markers and BRAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/MTOR
signalling pathways can differentially regulate the
autophagic process.

PI3K/MTOR inhibition
We initially examined the effect of PI-103, a dual
PI3K/MTOR pathway inhibitor, on cell signalling and
autophagy of BRAFV600E bearing colorectal cancer
cell lines as shown in Figure 3A (lanes 4, 8, 12), Figure
3B (4th column) and Figure 3E (3rd column). Induction
of autophagy was observed in the cell lines RKO and
HT29 after treatment of 1μM PI-103 for 24 h. In RKO
and HT29 cells, the increase in LC3II/LC3I protein level
ratio was accompanied by a reduction in p62 protein
levels, confirming a further activation of the autophagic
machinery caused by PI-103 treatment (Figure 3D, lanes 3
and 9). Analysis of cell viability, autophagy and apoptosis
after cell treatments with a larger number of PI3K/MTOR
inhibitors on BRAFV600E cell lines was performed.
Treatment with PI-103, a dual PI3K/MTOR inhibitor,
significantly reduced cell viability in RKO (Figure 3C),
while the number of MDC stained cells was increased by
an average 20% (Figure 3E). On the other hand, treatments
with AKT only inhibitor (GDC0941) or MTOR inhibitor
(Rapamycin) reduced cell viability in all three treated
mutant BRAF colon cancer cell lines in a similar way
(Figure 3C). MDC staining in RKO cells after treatment
with GDC0941 for 24 h did not change the number of
MDC stained autophagic vacuoles (Figure 3E, 3rd column,
lower row), whereas the number of LC3 positive cells
was increased (Sup. Figure 3). On the contrary, treatment
of the same cell line RKO with Rapamycin resulted
in a reduction in the number of cells showing highly
concentrated LC3 staining (Sup. Figure 3), but the total
number of MDC stained autophagic vacuoles did not
change. Cell treatment with 1μM of the dual inhibitor
PI3K/MTOR PI-103 for 24 h can trigger autophagic
properties, as shown by the induced overexpression of
LC3II protein levels, followed by a reduction in p62
protein levels in additional non BRAFV600E cancer cell
lines Caco-2, DLD1 and HCT116 (Figure 3F). In Caco2 and DLD1 cell lines, treatment with the dual PI3K/
MTOR inhibitor PI-103 (Figure 3F, lanes 2, 6, 14), was
necessary to increase LC3II protein levels and to activate
autophagy, as was also confirmed by MDC staining of
autophagosome vacuoles (Data not shown). Furthermore,
LC3 staining pattern was altered due to PI-103 treatment
in these cells (Figure 3G, 2nd column, 3rd row), even

Individual autophagy inhibitors can
differentially sensitize colon cancer cell lines
towards apoptosis
3-MA treatments induce partial response
Since BRAFV600E cell lines presented remarkable
autophagic properties, the efficiency of treatments with
autophagy inhibitors was tested in these cell lines. Using
the SRB-viability assay, cell responses of colorectal
BRAFV600E bearing cancer cell lines (RKO, HT29
and Colo-205) were measured after treatments with the
autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (also a
PI3KII inhibitor) and Bafilomycin A1 for 24, 48 and
72 h. The total number of cells was measured either by
phalloidin or by Hoechst staining, as indicated. Due to
inhibition of autophagy, cell viability was reduced by 1020% after treatment with 5mM 3-MA in RKO, HT29 and
Colo-205 cell lines for 24 and 48 h. Treatment of the three
colon adenocarcinoma cell lines bearing BRAFV600E
with 5mM 3-MA for 72 h in total, resulted in a 40-50%
reduction in cell viability (Figure 4A). On the other hand,
treatment of the same cell lines with 1mM 3-MA resulted
in a maximum 15-20% reduction on their viability after
72 h (Sup. Figure 4A, upper panel). Treatment with
5mM 3-MA resulted in apoptotic cell death in all three
BRAFV600E cell lines, as revealed by cleaved PARP,
cleaved Caspase 3 and Hoechst staining under confocal
microscopy. The presence of apoptotic cell death in
RKO and Colo-205 cells after 3-MA treatment for 24 h

initially confirmed by the detection of PARP cleavage by
Western blot analysis (Figure 4B). More evidence towards
this direction was provided by Hoechst staining (Figure
4D, 1st columns) and cleaved Caspase 3 (Figure 4D, 2nd
columns) by confocal microscopy: Upon 3-MA treatment,
RKO and Colo-205 cells became sensitive to apoptotic
cell death within the first 24 h (Figure 4D, RKO, 2nd row)
and (Figure 4D, Colo-205, 2nd row), while the number
of cleaved Caspase 3-stained nuclei was increased by
35% and 24% respectively after 72 h of treatment. HT29
cells showed a higher resistance and exhibited signs
of apoptotic nuclei after 48 h of 3-MA treatment (Data
not shown). Evaluation of the effect of 3-MA treatment
on autophagy markers was also performed (Figure 4B
and 4C). Interestingly, expression levels of autophagy
markers BECN1 and LC3 after 3-MA treatment were
only reduced in Colo-205 cells (Figure 4B, lanes 10, 11,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

12). Interestingly, the ratio between LC3 II and LC3 I,
representing an autophagy marker, was increased upon
longer 3-MA treatments in RKO (Figure 4B, lanes 2, 3,
4) cells, confirming a stabilization of autophagic marker
expression upon treatment of cells with autophagy
inhibitors [43, 52, 57]. Changes in total LC3 levels
reflect the effect of 3-MA treatment on LC3 expression,
while the increase in LC3II/I ratio represents activation
of autophagy. The stabilization of LC3 in RKO cell line
was also obvious after LC3 staining under confocal
microscope, where LC3 aggregates were accumulated
in the cytosole (Figure 4C(ii)). Furthermore, autophagy
inhibitor 3-MA stabilizes protein levels of LC3 partner,
p62, which is shown by a significant increase in p62 levels
upon longer time treatments in all three cell lines (Figure
4B). Levels of pERK were also higher upon longer time
points of 3-MA treatment, along with an increase in the
9206

LC3 II/I ratio, in these two cell lines RKO and HT29,
indirectly indicating again a positive correlation between
the BRAF/MEK/ERK proliferation pathway and the
presence of autophagy (Figure 4B). On the other hand, the
ratio between LC3 II and LC3 I, as well as pERK levels,
was reduced in Colo-205 cells upon longer time 3-MA
treatments. In accordance to this, autophagic vacuole
formation was inhibited in RKO and Colo-205 cells after
72 h of 3-MA treatment, as confirmed by MDC staining
upon confocal microscopy, while at the same time, cell
population was reduced in both cell lines (Figure 4C(i)).
The effect of 3-MA treatment on cell viability,
autophagy and apoptosis was also examined in the nonBRAFV600E colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, HCT116,
DLD-1 and SW620. After treatment with 5mM 3-MA for
24, 48 and 72h, cell viability was reduced up to more than
40% in HCT116 and SW620 cell lines in 72h treatment
(Figure 4E, lower panel), a result similar to that observed
in BRAFV600E cell lines. On the other hand, Caco-2 and
DLD-1 cell lines were more resistant to 3-MA treatments
(Figure 4E). In the sensitive to 3-MA HCT116 cell line,
bearing wtBRAF, the percentage of MDC stained vacuoles
was increased upon 48h treatment, but the number of
survived cells was significantly lower (Figure 4F, 2nd
column, lower row). The number of apoptotic nuclei was
increased upon treatment, as revealed by Hoechst staining
(Figure 4F, 4th lane).

performed. Also in this case of BafA1 treatment, there
was a controversial increase on LC3II levels, as well as
on the LC3 II/ LC3I ratio upon treatment with BafA1 for
48 h in all BRAFV600E mutant cell lines (Figure 5B,
lanes 2, 4, 6), confirming a stabilization of autophagic
marker expression upon treatment of cells with autophagy
inhibitors. The changes in total LC3 levels reflect the
effect of BafA1 treatment on LC3 expression, while
the increase in LC3II/I ratio represents the activation
of autophagy. p62 protein levels were also remarkably
increased upon treatment, following LC3 stabilization
(Figure 5B). BECN1, the other autophagic marker was
upregulated in RKO cells after BafA1 treatment (Figure
5B, lane 2), but was downregulated in HT29 (Figure
5B, lane 4) and Colo-205 (Figure 5B, lane 6), in which
PARP cleavage is more obvious. In accordance to this, the
percentage of autophagic vacuoles was higher by around
8% in RKO and by 24% in Colo-205 cells after 48 h of
Bafilomycin A1 treatment, as confirmed by MDC staining
upon confocal microscopy, while at the same time, cell
numbers were reduced in all three cell lines (Figure 5C(i)).
Moreover, staining with LC3 revealed an accumulation of
protein aggregates in all three cell lines, RKO, HT29 and
Colo-205, revealing the protein level stabilization due to
treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (Figure 5C(ii)).
The effect of BafA1 treatment on cell viability,
autophagy and apoptosis was also examined in the nonBRAFV600E colon cancer cell lines, Caco-2, HCT116,
DLD-1 and SW620. Upon treatment with 0,1μM BafA1,
cell viability was reduced by more than 80% in HCT116
and DLD-1 cell lines after 72 h treatment (Figure 5E,
lower panel), a result similar to that in BRAFV600E
cells. On the other hand, Caco-2 intermediate adenoma
cells were more resistant to BafA1 action by a difference
around 40% in cell viability after 72 h treatment, when
compared to all the examined adenocarcinoma cell lines
(Figure 5E, lower panel). Furthermore, in HCT116, MDC
staining of autophagic vacuoles did not significantly
change, (Figure 5F(i)). Despite the fact that the total
number of cells was reduced after 24h treatment, no
indication of apoptotic nuclei was detected under these
conditions (Figure 5F(ii)). Staining with LC3 revealed an
accumulation of protein aggregates, revealing also here the
protein stabilization due to treatment with an autophagy
inhibitor (Figure 5F(ii)).
Taking the above under consideration, it can be
proposed that autophagy presents a cytoprotective role in
colorectal cancer cell lines, since inhibition of autophagy
by two established autophagy inhibitors is remarkably
correlated with decrease in cell viability and appearance
of apoptosis. Remarkably, autophagy inhibitor BafA1
appears to be a very potent anti-cancer agent in the
examined colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, suggesting
to its further exploitation.

Bafilomycin A1 treatments efficiently sensitize
tumor cells to apoptosis
Treatment of the BRAFV600E colon cancer cell
lines with 0,1 μM Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), another
autophagy inhibitor, had an even stronger effect than that
of 3-MA treatment on cell viability: cell viability was
reduced to around 50% in all three cell lines, RKO, HT29
and Colo-205 after 48 h treatment, which was further
reduced to 20% after 72 h treatment with BafA1 (Figure
5A). Treatment with a higher concentration of 1μM BafA1
resulted in a similar reduction of cell viability as compared
to 0,1μM BafA1 in all three BRAFV600E cell lines
tested (Sup. Figure 4A, lower panel) and Sup. Figure 4B
therefore treatments with the lower concentration of
0,1μM BafA1 were selected for the next steps of the study.
Presence of apoptotic cell death was detected
within the first 48 h of treatment, both by PARP and
Caspase-3 cleavage after Western blot analysis (Figure
5B, lanes 2, 4, 6) accompanied by Hoechst (Figure
5D, 1st column) and cleaved Caspase 3 (Figure 5D, 2nd
column) staining under confocal microscopy. Upon
BafA1 treatment, RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 cells
became sensitive to apoptotic cell death, within the first
24 h (Figure 5D, RKO, 2nd row), (Figure 5D, HT29, 2nd
row), (Figure 5D, Colo-205, 3rd row). Evaluation of the

In detail, BRAFV600E colorectal cancer cell line
RKO was treated separately with increasing concentrations
of the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (GI50=2,6mM) (Data

(Figure 6A, lower left panel) in order to assess the effect
on cell viability. The fixed concentration of 1mM 3-MA

the two inhibitors was also estimated using the equation
DeltaGI=GIPLX4720+GI3-MA-GIcombination, based on the Bliss
Independence Model. Additive, synergistic or antagonistic
effects are shown in the lower right panel: values above
zero indicate antagonism, equal to zero additivity and
below zero synergism. The analysis has shown below
zero values in all but two combinatorial points, thus
demonstrating synergism for the combination of 3-MA
with specific concentrations of PLX4720 (Figure 6A,
lower right panel). As presented in this graph (Figure 6A,
lower right panel), there is a PLX4720 dose dependent
pattern for synergism, in all but the lowest or highest
PLX4720 concentrations. Notably, the best synergistic
effect on cell viability was delivered by combination of
1mM 3-MA with 0,156μM PLX4720.
In addition, pre- treatment of BRAFV600E colon
carcinoma cells with 5mM 3-MA followed by 0,5μM
PLX4720 treatment, resulted in a decrease of RKO cell
viability by 60% and around 40% in Colo-205 and HT29
cells. Remarkably, the protocol which is based on pretreatment of cells with 3-MA, followed by combinatorial
treatments of 3-MA with PLX-4720 resulted in a 16%
synergistic effect in the BRAFV600E adenocarcinoma
cell line RKO, when 5mM of 3-MA was used (Data not
shown).
The effects of efficient drug combinatorial and
synergistic treatments on cell death properties were further
analysed. Therefore, protein levels of PARP, P-ERK1/2,
LC3, p62 and tubulin were compared after treatment of
RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 cells with PLX4720 or 3-MA
individual treatments, pre-treatment with 3-MA and then
combination treatments of 3-MA with PLX4720. Pretreatment of cells with 3-MA followed by co-treatments of
3-MA with PLX4720 showed clear evidence of apoptosis,
confirmed by detection of cleaved PARP using western
blot analysis in RKO cells (Figure 6B, lane 4). These
results were validated with Hoecsht staining (Figure 6C,
1st column, 4th row), caspase-3 (Figure 6C, 2nd column,
4th row) cleavage detection and their merged staining
(Figure 6C, 3rd column, 4th row) as compared to the
control untreated cells (Figure 6C, 3rd column, 1st row)
in 2D cell culture. In RKO cell line, Caspase 3-stained
cells were higher by 14% after combinatorial treatment
with 3-MA and PLX4720, compared to 3-MA monotreatment. Furthermore, the ratio between LC3II and LC3I
was higher after combination treatment with PLX4720
and 3-MA and the same was true for p62 protein levels,
revealing a stabilization of the protein levels of these two
autophagy markers, due to the treatment (Figure 6B).
To test treatment conditions that mimic the real
tumor microenvironment, cells were grown in 3D cultures
and formed tumors in matrigel. Apoptotic nuclei were
also detected and quantified using the same combinatorial
drug protocol in 3D cell cultures of all three BRAFV600E
cell lines tested, as observed by Hoechst staining and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cleaved Caspase 3 antibody under confocal microscopy.
Furthermore, the tumor mass is significantly reduced in
3D culture, where cells appear apoptotic in pre- treatment
of tumors with 3-MA followed by co-treatment of 3-MA
with PLX4720. Interestingly, in contrast to the 2D culture,
the apoptotic effect of 3-MA and PLX4720 combination
is more evident and strong in the 3D culture in all of the
examined BRAFV600E colorectal cancer cell lines (Figure
6D, RKO, HT29, Colo-205). As already demonstrated
in previous figures, treatments involving autophagy
inhibitors generally stabilize the expression of autophagic
markers, like LC3 (Figure 6D, lanes 3-4, 7-8, 11-12). The
changes in total LC3 levels reflect the treatment results
of the individual inhibitors and their combination on LC3
expression, while the increase in LC3II/I ratio represents
the activation of autophagy.
Combination treatments with PLX4720 were also
performed for BafA1, in order to examine their potential
synergistic effect on BRAFV600E colorectal cancer cell
line viability and cell death, as tested by SRB assay and
confocal microscopy for Hoechst/Caspase-3, respectively,
but no evident synergy was observed as shown in Sup.
Figure 5.
This data indicate autophagy as a putative resistance
mechanism of colon cancer cell lines bearing mutant
BRAFV600E to BRAFV600E inhibitor PLX4720, since
inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA could sensitize the cells
to PLX4720 and apoptosis, thus indicating a promising
new combination for BRAFV600E colorectal tumor
treatment to be further exploited in vivo.

DISCUSSION
The present study investigates the association of
mutant KRAS, BRAF (and PIK3CA) in advanced and
recurrent autophagic process through regulation of the
two autophagic markers BECN1 and especially LC3 in
a number of CRC cell lines. The association of BRAF
mutant genes with increased autophagic activity was
exploited towards establishing novel as well as efficient
anti-cancer treatment protocols, which involve either
inhibitors of autophagy as a single agent treatment or their
rational combination with BRAF600E targeting drugs.

BRAFV600E induces autophagy in colorectal
tumor cells
Autophagosome formation requires LC3, a
protein conjugation system that resembles ubiquitin
and is important for transport and maturation of the
autophagosome [45]. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to demonstrate that high expression of the
autophagic factor LC3 is stimulated by the BRAF
oncogene as a notable example of an oncogenic kinase
regulating autophagy and to indicate the cytoprotective
role of autophagy in colorectal cancer cell lines bearing
9215

BRAFV600E [47]. Furthermore, an association between
EMT and autophagy has already been revealed in many
studies, where EMT markers are co-expressed with the
autophagic marker LC3 [46]. In the present study we also
noticed a relevant correlation between cell lines with EMT
characteristics and a low ratio of LC3II/ LC3I protein
expression.
BRAFV600E is a major tumorigenic oncogene.
The presented data show that BRAFV600E can induce
autophagy through over-activation of MEK/ERK pathway.
This pathway not only can induce the expression of LC3,
but can also trigger the autophagosome formation in
BRAFV600E colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, it is
shown here that the two signaling pathways MEK/ERK
and AKT/MTOR can differentially regulate the autophagic
process: the MEK/ERK pathway is able to increase the
activity of basic autophagy and related cell properties,
and BRAF/MEK inhibitors can reduce the expression
of autophagic markers. The AKT/MTOR pathways
inhibit autophagic mechanisms and properties. Notably,
simultaneous inhibition of AKT and MTOR pathways
resulted in a remarkable induction of autophagic markers
and related cell properties-morphology in the majority of
the treated cell lines. Many studies have demonstrated that
inhibition of MEK/ERK and AKT/MTOR pathways can
lead to cell death [48, 49]. Autophagy is known to play an
important role in tumor cell survival, while in cancer cells,
autophagy is used as a way to deal with cellular stress
[50]. Once autophagy-related genes were inhibited, cell
death was potentiated in several cases [51]. Furthermore,
inhibition of autophagy has also been shown to enhance
the effectiveness of anticancer therapies.
Mutant KRAS oncogene can decrease the expression
of the autophagic marker BECN1. Nevertheless, the ratio
between LC3II and LC3I protein levels increases in
the presence of KRAS oncogene, which further results
in p62 downregulation, indicating an induction of
the autophagic process, as shown in the current study
utilizing colorectal cancer cells. When mutant KRAS
co-exists with mutant PIK3CA in the same tumor, the
protein levels of autophagic factor LC3 are recorded high.
While mutant KRAS is connected with upregulation of
autophagic markers and autophagy, several other studies
support the opposite hypothesis [10, 52]. We report here
that expression of HRASV12 oncogene, an isoform of the
RAS family, does not affect the autophagy state, though
enhancing the levels of the autophagic marker BECN1,
which has been described to increase basal autophagy
and limit the starvation-induced autophagy [10–13]. As
already mentioned,BRAFV600E oncogene increases
significantly the level of LC3, thus inducing autophagic
markers. Therefore this study provides for the first time, a
comparative study of BRAF, KRAS and HRAS oncogenes
regarding their differential regulation of autophagic
markers and related properties in colorectal tumor cells.

BECN1 and LC3 were downregulated in the
majority of examined tumors. In a previous study [53]
it was shown that in 56% of breast cancers there was a
significant decrease of BECN1 protein expression in
cancer cells compared to normal breast epithelial cells.
In both colorectal and gastric cancers where BECN1
mutations rarely occur, decrease of BECN1 expression
in cancer cells could be an inactivation mechanism of
BECN1 tumor suppressor functions. Another study by
Giatromanolaki A et al has found that perinuclear LC3A
accumulation in colorectal tumor cells is a marker of
good prognosis, presumably reflecting a basal autophagic
activity [54]. Here, we provide further evidence for the
strong association of BRAFV600E, another mutant
oncoprotein of RAS pathway, with increased expression
of autophagic markers in colorectal tumors and cancer cell
lines.

Rational efficient combinatorial treatment
protocols against resistant BRAFV600E
colorectal tumors, utilizing BRAFV600E
and autophagy inhibitors
Autophagy-related stress tolerance can enable cell
survival by maintaining energy production that can lead
to tumor growth and anti-cancer therapy resistance [55].
Treatment of cells that have acquired therapeutic resistance
with autophagy inhibitors shows particular promise in
many preliminary studies [56]. When bafilomycin A1
was used to inhibit γ-irradiation-induced autophagy in
breast, prostate and colon cancer tumors, cells underwent
apoptosis, and the antitumor effect of γ-irradiation was
increased. These results indicate that autophagy could be
a defense mechanism of cancer cells against radiationinduced apoptosis. So if autophagy protects cells from
drug-induced apoptosis, agents that block autophagy
might enhance the antitumor efficacy of cytotoxic agents
[57, 58]. Fundamental knowledge of the role of autophagy
in the immune system may provide new clues to improve
immunotherapy of cancer in many cases. Highlights
of ongoing phase I and phase II clinical trials for firstgeneration inhibitor of autophagy, hydroxy-chloroquine,
rise the potential for clinical application in this field [22].
In the current study, inhibition of autophagy either
by 3-MA (inhibition in early stage of autophagophore
formation) or Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (inhibition in later
stage- in maturation of autophagophore) leads to a strong
reduction in cell viability and activation of apoptosis,
in cells treated only with BafA1. Mono-treatments with
BafA1 were very efficient in all colorectal adenocarcinoma
cell lines tested, but not in the intermediate adenoma
cell line Caco-2. It is proposed that further studies are
necessary for its establishment as an efficient therapeutic
agent. Treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with
5mM 3-MA provides evidence that the most resistant cell
lines DLD-1 and HT29 present high levels of autophagic
9216

markers like LC3II/LC3I ratio and MDC staining. On the
other hand, the partial response of colorectal cancer cells
to 3-MA has been exploited here towards its potential
synergistic action with targeted therapeutics.
The specific inhibitor PLX4032 (Vemurafenib)
has given impressive results in clinical trials involving
patients with BRAFV600E melanoma, causing significant
tumor regression [59, 60]. In melanoma, combinatorial
treatments of BRAFV600E targeting drugs with
novel autophagy inhibitors may overcome resistance
[61]. Colorectal cancer and other cancer types show
intrinsic resistance to BRAFV600E specific inhibitors.
Combinatorial treatments that include BRAF and EGFR
inhibitors achieve encouraging preclinical, as well as
clinical results [26, 62]. Other studies support that Akt,
a member of the PI3K/Akt/MTOR pathway, could also
drive tumor resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors and thus
simultaneous inhibition of those two pathways (BRAF and
PI3K) is needed [33, 63, 64].
Inhibition of autophagy not only can contribute
to decreased tumor cell numbers, but will also sensitize
cancer cells to kinase inhibitors, like vemurafenib, to
trigger the apoptotic cell death [50, 53]. In a recent
study in a brain tumor bearing BRAFV00E, the effect
of chemotherapeutic treatment using vemurafenib
following autophagy inhibition by chloroquine was
enhanced [65, 66]. The effect of another anti-cancer
drug, pouranole, is increased after the combination
with the specific autophagic inhibitor 3-MA and results
in tumor cell death through apoptosis [67]. In addition,
Bokobza et al, 2014, have shown the reduction of a
tumor right after autophagy inhibition by chloroquine in
combination with an AKT kinase inhibitor [68]. In our
study, solid evidence presenting the protective action of
autophagy in colon cancer cells bearing BRAFV600E is
provided. Data presented here provide strong evidence
that pre-incubation with 3-MA followed by concomitant
treatment with BRAFV600E targeting PLX4720 inhibitor
leads to a synergistic effect that sensitizes cells to
apoptotic cell death. [40, 41]. Therefore, BRAFV600E
induced over-expression of key autophagy molecules
and markers presented in the first part of this study, has
been further exploited by providing solid evidence of
efficient combinatorial treatments of anti-BRAFV600E
and autophagy inhibitors, that can sensitize resistant
BRAFV600E colorectal tumor cells to apoptosis in vitro.
These combinatorial treatments involving a BRAFV600E
specific inhibitor and an autophagy inhibitor could be
further exploited for their potent efficiency in vivo. Unlike
melanomas, where the targeted BRAFV600E inhibitor
vemurafenib leads cells to death through apoptosis [59],
it is likely that the observed resistance of colon cancer
cells and tumors to vemurafenib is partially due to the
protective effect of autophagy in these cells.
In conclusion, it is clear from this ex vivo study that
autophagy is triggered by BRAFV600E and the signalling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway RAF/MEK/ERK. Furthermore, the cytoprotective
role of autophagy in colon cancer cell lines bearing this
mutation is a new and promising target for the future anticancer strategy on patients with mutant BRAFV600E.
It is also proposed that autophagy could be targeted in
nonBRAFV600E colorectal tumors by selected existing
or novel autophagy inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
DLD-1, HCT116, RKO, HT29, Colo-205 and
SW620 human colon adenocarcinoma and Caco-2 colon
intermediate adenoma cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and DKO4 and HKE-3 were kindly provided by S. Shirasawa et
al [35]. Oncogenic cell models used in the present study
were generated in Caco-2 cells using stable transfection
in order to constitutively express HRASG12V (Caco-H),
KRASG12V (Caco-K) [36] or BRAFV600E (Caco-BR)
oncogenes [37]. Clones RKOshBR 2 and RKOshBR 10
were derived after silencing of BRAFV600E with stable
transfection of shRNA against BRAFV600E in RKO cells.
The small inhibitory duplex shRNA oligo was cloned into
the HindIII and BglII sites in pSUPER (Oligoengine,
Seattle, WA), as described in Makrodouli et al., 2011 [38].
The sense strand of the shRNA pSUPER BRAFV600E
insert was BRAFmutshRNA:gatccccGCTACAGAG
AAATCTCGAT-ttcaagagaATCGAGATTTCTCTG
TAGCtttttggaaa [39]. RKO cells were also transfected with
the empty vector (pSUPER using the CaPO4 precipitation
technique and selected with Geneticin (Invitrogen). The
names of clones used in this study are: RKOpSUPER-1
(for empty vector) and RKOshBR 2 and 10 cell clones (for
BRAFV600E silencing). All cell lines used in this study
were grown in D-MEM medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, antibiotics and amino acids (all from Invitrogen).

Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer.
Extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Scheicher & Schuell,
Dassel, Germany). Membranes were incubated with the
specific antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed and incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibody, for 1 h at room
temperature. Antibodies were used against: pAKT (s473)
#9271, pS6R (s235/236) #2211, pMEK (s217/221) #9121,
LC3B(D11) #3868, pBRAF #2996, total Caspase-3 #9662,

Cell viability assay

Inhibitors

For growth studies the sulforhodamine B (SRB,
SIGMA) assay was used. Firstly, tumor cells were seeded
into 96-well micro titer plates and were allowed to attach
overnight. Thereafter, the cell number in treated versus
control wells was estimated after treatment with 10%
trichloroacetic acid and staining with 0.4% SRB in 1%
acetic acid. The percentage of viable cell was plotted each
time. SD was used for error bar generation.
The median effect analysis was used for calculation
of combination indices (CI) [40, 41]. Synergism was
determined using the method previously described [41, 42].

Two dimensional culture
For the 2D culture experiments, cells (5000 cells/
well) were grown on coverslips in 24 well plates in
medium, at 37°C. Photographs of the 2D cultures were
taken under light and confocal microscope (Leica 626
TCS SPE confocal laser scanning microscope after the
appropriate staining). LAS AF software was used for
image 627 acquisition (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg,
Germany). For the confocal analysis, cells were labeled
with 0.1 mM monodansylcadaverin (MDC) (Sigma)
in PBS at 37°C for 15 min. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and immediately
analyzed in confocal to detect the autophagic vacuoles.
MDC is an auto-fluorescent marker that preferentially
accumulates in autophagic vacuoles after which
treatment were applied for indicated incubation times.
MDC accumulation in autophagic vacuoles is due to a
combination of ion trapping and specific interactions
with vacuole membrane lipids. Cell cytoskeleton was
stained with phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 546, A22283, Life
technologies). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst No.
33342 (Sigma, B2261) for apoptosis detection; Cleaved
caspase-3, another marker of apoptosis, was detected by
cleaved caspase-3 antibody.

RNA Extraction/reverse transcription and real
time-PCR
Total RNA isolation from cultured cells as well as
cancer specimens was performed using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Reverse transcription
was carried out from 3.0 μg of purified RNA using the
SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-time quantification at the mRNA level was carried
out in 96-well PCR plates using a Bio-Rad iCycler and
the iQ5 Multicolor real-Time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules CA, USA). Each reaction contained 1× iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA)
and 150 nmol/L of each primer. All genes were tested in
duplicates. Results were analyzed on the iCycler software.
Values were normalized to GAPDH. Primers used were
the following: GAPDH: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT
(Fw) and CATGGGTGGAATCATATTGGAA (Rv),
LC3:
GAGAAGCAGCTTCCTGTTCTGG
(Fw)
and
GTGTGCGTTCACCAACAGGAAG
(Rv).
BECN1: GGCTGAGAGACTGGATCAGG (Fw) and
CTGCGTCTGGGCATAACG (Rv).
Tumor specimens undergoing surgery for CRC at G.
Genimatas General Hospital of Athens participated in the
study and gave written consent. The study protocol was
approved by the Medical Ethical Review Committee of
G. Genimatas General Hospital of Athens.Upon surgery,
resected samples were placed in 5 ml RNAlater (Ambion,
Austin, USA) to preserve RNA integrity and transferred
to the laboratory.

Three dimensional culture
For three-dimensional culture experiments, cells
were grown in 24-well plates on 20% Matrigel (BD
Bioscience) that was allowed to set for 15 minutes
at 37°C in order to form a gel of 1 mm thickness. The
bottom later was then covered with 2×104 cells mixed
1:1 with 4% Matrigel in a total volume of 600 μl. Growth
medium containing 2% matrigel was replaced every 2
days and the cells were left to grow for 12–14 days to
allow development of extensive tubule network, after
which treatment were applied for indicated incubation
times. Photographs of the three-dimensional cultures were
