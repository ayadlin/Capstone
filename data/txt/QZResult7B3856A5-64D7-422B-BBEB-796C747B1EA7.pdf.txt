Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are the standard endocrine therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer;
however, currently used biomarkers, i.e., estrogen receptor-alpha/progesterone receptor (ERα/PR),
predict only slightly more than half of the potential responders to AI treatment. To identify novel
markers of AI responsiveness, a genome-wide microarray analysis was performed using primary
breast tumor samples from 50 postmenopausal women (PMW) who later developed metastatic
breast cancer. Sushi domain containing 3 (SUSD3) was significantly differentially expressed gene,
with 3.38-fold higher mRNA levels in AI-responsive breast tumors versus non-responders
(p<0.001). SUSD3 was highly expressed in ERα-positive breast tumors and treatment with
estradiol increased SUSD3 expression in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. Treatment with an
antiestrogen or ERα knockdown abolished basal and estradiol-dependent SUSD3 expression.
Recruitment of ERα upstream of the transcription start site of SUSD3 was demonstrated by
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR. Flow cytometric analysis of SUSD3 knockdown
cells revealed blunted estradiol effects on progression into S and M phases. SUSD3 was localized
to the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. SUSD3 knockdown decreased the appearance of
actin-rich protrusions, stress fibers and large basal focal adhesions, while increasing the presence
of cortical actin concomitant with a decrease in Rho and FAK activity. SUSD3-deficient cells
demonstrated diminished cell spreading, cell-cell adhesion, and motility. In conclusion, SUSD3 is
a novel promoter of estrogen-dependent cell proliferation and regulator of cell-cell and cellsubstrate interactions and migration in breast cancer. It may serve as a novel predictor of response
to endocrine therapy and potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer is an estrogen and progesterone-dependent disease with variable treatment
responsiveness. The mitogenic role of estrogen in breast cancer is well established1,2. Both
estrogen synthesis and its receptor (ERα) are targeted by endocrine therapies1,2. Aromatase
inhibitors (AIs) block estrogen formation by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase, whereas the
estradiol antagonist tamoxifen (TAM) targets ERα3,4. Despite clinical advances in breast
cancer treatment, not all patients respond to endocrine therapy and some initial responders
experience disease recurrence or progression during therapy3-13. The heterogeneous nature
of the disease and the unpredictability of treatment outcomes have prompted the search for
new biomarkers of responsiveness for endocrine therapies.
AIs are the most commonly used class of drugs in the long-term treatment of breast
cancer3,4. Adjuvant therapy with AIs has largely replaced TAM and other anti-estrogens as
the first-line endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women (PMW) with hormone
receptor-positive disease3-7. There is a need to identify patients who will respond to AIs,
sparing those with resistant tumors the adverse effects of ineffective therapy. Currently,
biomarkers for TAM responsiveness—ERα or progesterone receptor (PR) protein
immunoreactivity in breast tumors—are used as surrogate predictors for AI
responsiveness8-10. Using these biomarkers, response rate to AIs is 35-70%11-13,
representing a major obstacle to optimal treatment.

We studied 50 tumor RNA samples obtained between 1990-1995 from PMW with breast
cancer who, after surgery and TAM treatment, experienced recurrence, progression and
metastasis. Receptor status had been unknown at the time endocrine therapy was first
started. Responsiveness of local and metastatic disease to AI therapy was measured by
clinical benefit (complete/partial response, or stable disease) for at least 6 months of
treatment14. Patients were then placed on AI, and 51% of them demonstrated clinical benefit
regardless of hormone receptor status. The status of immunoreactive ERα/PR was later
determined and found to have a 58% positive predictive value for clinical benefit15. The
poor predictive response of ERα/PR immunoreactivity prompted the search for new markers
of AI response. Here, we identify and characterize sushi domain containing-3 (SUSD3), a
gene significantly overexpressed in AI responders in a microarray analysis of these tumor
samples. We also demonstrate its role in breast cancer cell proliferation as well as cell-cell
and cell-substrate adhesion and migration through Rho-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
signaling.

RESULTS
Microarray Gene Expression Analysis of Primary Breast Cancer Tumors
Of the 50 patients, 27 demonstrated clinical benefit from AI treatment for at least 6 months,
and 23 did not. The top 50 differentially expressed genes are listed based on the best pvalues (Table 1). SUSD3 is highly expressed in AI responders compared with nonresponders (3.04-fold), with the highest significance (p=0.0000319). Given the lack of
scientific knowledge regarding SUSD3, we focused our efforts on its characterization.
Interestingly, ESR1 which encodes ERα ranked number 9, whereas PR encoding PGR was
not in top 50 (Table 1).
SUSD3 qRT-PCR Validation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Forty-nine high-quality mRNA samples were available for validation (27 responders and 22
non-responders). SUSD3 mRNA levels were 3.38-fold higher in responders (p=0.0004;
Figure 1A). In clinical practice, a tumor's ERα-positive status is often used as a predictive
marker of AI responsiveness8-10; therefore, we assessed the correlation between SUSD3 and
ERα expression. Among ERα-positive tumors, AI-responders (n=27) had 2.48-fold higher
levels of SUSD3 mRNA compared with non-responders (n=15; p=0.0118; Figure 1B). In
analyzed tumors, SUSD3 mRNA was 12.3-fold higher in ERα-positive (n=42) compared to
ERα-negative (n=7) tumors (p=0.0009; Figure 1C). In vivo, there was a robust positive
correlation between ERα and SUSD3 expression (R=0.82), suggesting strong association
(Supplemental Figure 1A). Expression of SUSD3 was assessed in MCF7, T47D, MDAMB231, and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines and Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cell
line. Highest SUSD3 expression was observed in ERα/PR-positive cell lines (Ishikawa,
T47D, MCF7), whereas the two ERα/PR-negative cells (MDA-MB231, SKBR3) contained
the lowest levels (Supplemental Figure 1B).
ERα Directly Regulates SUSD3 Expression
Given the strong correlation observed between ERα and SUSD3 expression, we investigated
whether ERα and its ligand E2 regulate SUSD3. E2 induced SUSD3 mRNA in MCF7 cells
in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with the highest levels seen after a 24h treatment
(Supplemental Figure 1C,D). The antiestrogen ICI 182780 inhibited the stimulatory effect of
E2 on SUSD3 expression (p< 0.0001; Figure 1D). ERα knockdown led to the significant
down-regulation of SUSD3 mRNA that could not be restored with E2 treatment (Figure 1E).
The addition of translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) had no effect on E2-stimulated
SUSD3 expression in MCF7 and T47D cells, suggesting that induction of SUSD3 mRNA is
a direct effect of ERα and does not require new protein synthesis (Figure 1F,G).

Author Manuscript

We further examined the role of ERα in SUSD3 regulation using ChIP assays. SUSD3
transcription start site in MCF7 cells was found using 5′ RACE, likely transcription start site
(TSS) being in a region -21bp upstream of Exon 1 of isoform 1. The mapped SUSD3 TSS
was consistent with its annotated TSS16. After 30min of E2 treatment, ERα is recruited to a
distinct region approximately 5,000bp upstream of the SUSD3 TSS (Figure 1H).
Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) identified four half ERE sequences in this

region17. Together, our data strongly suggest that ERα regulates SUSD3 expression by
interacting directly with its regulatory region in an E2-dependent manner.
Effect of SUSD3 Knockdown on Breast Cancer Cells Growth

Author Manuscript

We transfected MCF7 and T47D cells with control or selected SUSD3 siRNAs; qRT-PCR
and western blot demonstrated that two distinct siRNAs (oligo4 and 5) robustly ablated
SUSD3 expression (Supplemental Figures 2A-D). The ORF-targeted oligo4 was used for all
work done, whereas the 3’UTR targeted oligo5 was used to confirm all the major findings
(see Supplemental figures). SUSD3 knockdown led to dramatic cell growth arrest after
siRNA transfection of MCF7 and T47D cells (Figure 2A, Supplemental 3A). This effect was
not due to an increase in cell death, as apoptosis levels, measured by TUNEL staining and
nuclear morphology changes, remained the same in control and SUSD3-ablated MCF7 and
T47D cells (Supplemental Figure 3B). To assess effects of SUSD3 on the cell cycle, we
used a DNA binding dye to resolve cells into three groups (G0/G1; S; G2/M) and chromatin
staining with phosphorylated histone H3, which specifically determines the percentage of
cells in M phase. In control cells, E2 treatment led to a significant decrease in the percentage
of cells in G0/G1 phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in S, G2 and
M phases (Figures 2B-E). SUSD3 knockdown eliminated the effect of E2 in all phases of
cell cycle (Figures 2B-E).
SUSD3 Localizes to the Plasma Membrane and Promotes Cell-Cell Adhesion
To study functions of SUSD3 we investigated its cellular localization. Confocal imaging
with E-cadherin shows GFP-tagged SUSD3 expressed in MCF7 cells and prominently
localized to cell-cell borders (Figures 3A,B). This raised the possibility that SUSD3 may
play a role in cell-cell adhesion.

Author Manuscript

We tested cell-cell adhesion strength in control and siSUSD3 MCF7 cells using dispase
assay. Whereas dispase treated monolayers of control cells were moderately disturbed upon
mechanical stress producing on average 30 fragments, SUSD3-ablated MCF7 monolayers
completely disintegrated, producing over 400 fragments in each experiment (Figures 4A,B).
This finding indicated that SUSD3 is critical for promoting cell-cell adhesion in MCF7
breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To study cell-cell adhesion independent of interactions with an underlying substrate, we
performed an adhesion assay of cells in suspension, followed by exposure of aggregates to
shear stress. SUSD3-deficient cells had diminished ability to form adhesive clusters
compared to control cells (Figures 4C,D). After applying shear stress, >25% of control cells
remained in large clusters (>100 cells), which were virtually absent in the SUSD3-deficient
cells (Figure 4E). Approximately 70% of SUSD3-deficient cells were individual or in very
small (<20 cells) clusters, indicating that SUSD3 expression increases cell-cell adhesive
strength and resistance of MCF7 breast cancer cells to shear stress independent of cellsubstrate interactions.

SUSD3 Deficiency Alters MCF7 Breast Cancer Cell Morphology

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Studies have demonstrated the role of E2 and ERα in the formation of actin-rich protrusions
such as filopodia and lamellipodia in breast cancer cells18-20. We therefore assessed the
effect of SUSD3-knockdown on MCF7 cell morphology. Phase contrast and confocal
imaging revealed that, compared with controls, SUSD3-deficient cells had a significantly
lower surface area (Figure 5A). Knockdown cells displayed a smaller and rounder
phenotype, prompting us to speculate that they may have spreading defects (Figure 5B,
Supplemental Figure 4A). SUSD3-ablated cells demonstrated over 3-fold decrease in actinrich protrusions and stress fibers (Figure 5B,C; Supplemental Figure 4B). Whereas all of the
knockdown cells exhibited thickened cortical actin on at least 50% of their cell borders,
almost none of the control cells did, with 78% of them having no cortical acting thickening
at all (Figures 5B,D, Supplemental Figure 4B). Cell symmetry measurements indicated a
prominent shift towards circular phenotype of SUSD3-ablated cells while control cells
displayed a varied morphology (Figure 5E).
We also examined focal adhesions in control and knockdown cells. Paxillin-containing focal
adhesions were observed at edges of SUSD3-ablated cells coinciding with thickened cortical
actin (Figure 6A, Supplemental Figure 4B). Moreover, large pointed focal adhesions
anchoring stress fibers, prominent in control cells, were almost completely absent from
SUSD3-knockdown cells21 (Figure 6A). Rescue experiment demonstrated knockdown
specificity with co-expression of a siRNA-resistant construct. SUSD3-GFP expressing cells
were resistant to SUSD3-siRNA induced morphological changes (Supplemental Figure 4C).

Author Manuscript

Changes observed in stress fibers and focal adhesions of SUSD3-knockdown cells were
suggestive of changes in Rho GTPase signaling, which has been implicated in the
establishment of cell-cell contacts and cell matrix interactions22,23. Therefore, we
investigated levels of active GTP-bound Rho and Rac in control and SUSD3-knockdown
cells. Interestingly, no significant differences in Rac activity were observed; however, Rho
activity was significantly lower in SUSD3-knockdown cells compared to controls (Figure
6B). Since Rho activity is required for formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions24, the
decrease in its activity could be linked to the observed disruption of stress fibers and ventral
focal adhesions in SUSD3-ablated cells.

Author Manuscript

We next analyzed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity in SUSD3-knockdown cells. FAK is
a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase whose activity plays an important role in integrinmediated signal transduction pathways and has been shown to be important in breast cancer
progression, invasion, and dynamic turnover of focal adhesions25,26. Expression levels of
FAK were higher in SUSD3-knockdown cells than in controls; however, phosphorylated
(active) FAK levels were lower than in controls, suggesting a large decrease in the portion
of activated FAK in SUSD3-knockdown cells (Figure 6C). SUSD3-ablated cells
demonstrated >8-fold decrease in activated FAK (Figure 6C). Decreased FAK activity has
been demonstrated in cells displaying a thickened cortical actin phenotype21. Taken
together, these data suggest that loss of SUSD3 may interfere with normal FAK/Rhomediated focal adhesion dynamics in MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells27.

Loss of SUSD3 Impedes Breast Cancer Cell Motility

Author Manuscript

Cell migration is a critical step in cancer invasion and metastasis, and FAK, paxillin, and
Rho GTPases have been implicated in metastasis23,25,26,28-31. Localization of SUSD3 to the
plasma membrane and its effects on actin-rich cell protrusions, focal adhesions, and Rho and
FAK activity point to a role of SUSD3 in cell migration. We therefore performed wound
healing experiments with MCF7 cells transfected with control or SUSD3 siRNA (Figure
6D). To prevent the confounding effect of cell proliferation, mitomycin C, a potent inhibitor
of DNA synthesis, was added to the media. Measured as percentage of wound left open after
24h, SUSD3-knockdown cells showed 2-fold lower motility compared with control cells
(Figure 6E, Supplemental Figure 5A). A continued deficiency in motility in SUSD3knockdown cells was observed up to 72h after the scratch wound (Supplemental Figure 5B).
Results were replicated in T47D cells (Supplemental Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

AIs occupy a central role in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer by blocking the
metastatic spread of hormone-dependent breast cancer1-7,32-34. Despite demonstrated
superiority over TAM, response rates of AIs remain about 50% in advanced breast
cancer3,4,12-14. Genome-wide searches using clinical samples from patients treated with AIs
offer hope in identifying new markers that may better predict responsiveness to therapy35,36.
To date, however, a biochemically and functionally defined in vivo marker for AI
responsiveness has not been reported8-10. Using a similar genome-wide approach, our lab
profiled the mRNA from tumors of PMW who developed breast cancer and were
subsequently treated with an AI for recurrent and metastatic disease. Hormone receptor
status was unknown at time of treatment, but 10-year survival data after AI treatment was
available to assess responsiveness. We found that SUSD3 expression was 3.38-fold higher
in patients who responded to AI therapy.
SUSD3 is located on chromosome 9 and has three isoforms37. Literature regarding SUSD3
is limited and its function is unknown. SUSD3 expression has been reported in ERα-positive
breast tumors38 with decreased expression reported in aggressive malignant tumors (triplenegative status, endocrine insensitivity, and short-term survival)39. Recent literature has
linked its homolog, SUSD2, to increased invasion of breast cancer cells. SUSD2 contains a
transmembrane domain and functional domains inherent to adhesions molecules40.

Author Manuscript

Here, we demonstrated that SUSD3 is regulated by E2 and ERα in MCF7 breast cancer
cells, and that siRNA knockdown of SUSD3 abolishes the mitogenic effects of E2 on these
cells. It is possible that SUSD3 mediates some of the mitogenic effects of E2 via enhancing
the progression of malignant cells from the G2 into the S and M phases. Cancer cells often
have alterations in activity or expression levels of genes that control cell cycle, which has
been proposed as a mechanism for resistance to endocrine therapy41.
We found that SUSD3 is located at cell-cell borders, and that its loss leads to changes in
cell-cell adhesion, cell morphology, and migration. Studies have demonstrated the role of
estrogens and ERα in stimulating breast cancer cell migration via activation of various
signaling pathways regulating cell morphology and motility18,19,42,43. E2 treatment of breast

cancer cells leads to formation of focal adhesion complexes, filopodia, lamellipodia, and
pseudopodia42,43. Migrating cells must coordinate extension of the leading edge of the cell
and retraction of the back edge which require turnover of focal adhesion complexes29,30,44.
During the process of cell spreading, integrin-containing filopodia form initial adhesion sites
with subsequent recruitment of FAK and paxillin leading to formation of mature focal
adhesions29,30,44. Phosphorylated FAK is required for organization of the leading edge of
migrating cells and for focal adhesion disassembly at the trailing edge of the cell25,28,30.
FAK is important in breast cancer progression, invasion, and focal adhesions26,27.

Author Manuscript

While our data demonstrated an increase in total FAK expression, phosphorylated FAK was
significantly decreased in SUSD3-knockdown cells, suggesting a defect in FAK activation
in these cells. The ratio of active to inactive FAK is greatly reduced in SUSD3 deficient
cells indicating a functional loss of FAK signaling in these cells. It is possible that the
increase of total FAK is an attempt of cells to compensate for the loss of FAK activity due to
SUSD3 loss. In wound healing experiments and morphological studies, SUSD3-knockdown
showed decreased cell motility, reduced formation of actin-rich cell protrusions, paxillin
containing focal adhesions, stress fibers, and a reduction in overall cell surface area.
Together, the data suggest that SUSD3 deficiency leads to a defect in focal adhesion and
stress fiber formation; thereby inhibiting cell spreading and subsequent migration22.

Author Manuscript

The breakdown of cell adhesion is directly implicated in carcinogenesis, whereas
deregulation of intercellular adhesion has been linked to the onset of breast cancers among
other solid tumors45-47. For example, E-cadherin loss and inappropriate expression of nonepithelial cadherins have been implicated in invasion and metastasis47. Here we
demonstrated that SUSD3 is essential for cell-cell adhesive strength. In SUSD3-deficient
MCF7 cells, mechanical stress resulted in complete disintegration of cell-cell adhesions.
This result was further validated in our hanging drop test which revealed the inability of
SUSD3-deficient cells to form large cell clusters.

Author Manuscript

The Rho GTPases are key regulators of actin assembly and control the formation of stress
fibers, filopodia, and lamellipodia. Moreover, they regulate focal adhesion assembly, cell
motility, polarity, and cell cycle progression. Alterations in Rho GTPase signaling have been
implicated in cancer cell invasion22,24,31,32. In this study, confocal imaging revealed
thickened cortical actin coinciding with paxillin-containing focal adhesions at the edges of
the SUSD3-knockdown cells. Furthermore, the diminished number of both stress fibers and
large basal focal adhesions suggested disruption in Rho GTPase signaling compared to
control cells. GLISA confirmed significantly lower Rho GTPase activity in SUSD3deficient cells compared with controls. Taken together with the decrease in FAK activation
discussed above, our data indicate deregulation of FAK/Rho-mediated focal adhesion
dynamics in SUSD3-deficient cells.
In conclusion, we report a novel estrogen-mediated ERα-regulated gene, SUSD3, which
plays an important role in E2-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation, adhesion and
migration. We suspect that in ERα-positive tumors, high levels of SUSD3 induced by E2
support breast cancer cell motility. In the presence of an AI, estrogen levels are significantly
decreased, leading to reduced levels of SUSD3 and thereby diminished motility. Multiple

signaling pathways that facilitate the invasion of extra-mammary tissues and underlie the
metastatic nature of breast cancer cells have been investigated to help aid in the
development of treatments for breast cancer invasion. As cell migration is a key first step in
the metastatic process, further experiments need to be performed to better delineate the
interplay between SUSD3, Rho GTPases, and numerous signaling molecules, including
paxillin and FAK, which are involved in the complex steps of cell migration, morphology,
and cytoskeleton dynamics. SUSD3 may serve as a future diagnostic and therapeutic target
in the treatment of breast cancer. Its subcellular localization to the cell surface makes it an
attractive therapeutic target.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and Tissues

Author Manuscript

RNA samples from 50 primary tumors from PMW who developed breast cancer in
1990-1995 were obtained from Royal Marsden Hospital, UK. Patients underwent surgery
and were treated with adjuvant TAM. All patients subsequently developed recurrent locally
advanced or metastatic disease and were then placed on either anastrozole or letrozole.
Hormone receptor status of the tumors had not been determined before administration of
adjuvant therapy because this treatment was experimental at that time15. ER/PR status of
these tumors were determined by immunohistochemistry after treatment was completed.
Human breast cancer cells, MCF7, T47D, endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cancer
cells (all ERα/PR+), MD-MBA231 (ERα/PR−), and SKBR3 (ERα/PR−, HER2+), were
obtained from ATCC and cultured as described48-50.

Author Manuscript

For experiments evaluating estradiol-β (E2), ICI 182780 (anti-estradiol), and cycloheximide
(CHX) responsiveness, cells were cultured in charcoal-stripped FBS for 48h followed by
overnight serum starvation prior to treatment with E2 (100nM) for 24h. For ICI and CHX
experiments, cells were treated 1h with either compound (10μM) prior to the addition of E2.
Time course and dose response experiments were performed to optimize gene expression.
Microarray and Data Analysis

Author Manuscript

mRNA microarray analysis was performed using an ABI 1700 chemiluminescent
microarray analyzer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and data was normalized by the
quantile normalization procedure using the bioconductor package Affy (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Gene expression data sets containing information on fold change and p-values
from two sample t-tests comparing Al responders to non-responders were determined. We
analyzed differentially expressed genes with fold change >1.5 and p-values <0.05. 32,878
probes were used in the microarray. Two criteria, flag counts ≤10, and coefficients of
variation >0.07 were used to select probes whose transcript levels were likely to be above
background noise and vary across tumor samples. This filtering procedure resulted in 5197
probes for data analysis. We observed 524 genes with p-value <0.05 and false discovery rate
of 37%, which is more than expected by chance alone51 Genes were verified by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).

RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies). cDNA was prepared with
qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). Expression of mRNA
was measured by qRT-PCR using ABI 7900 Sequence Detection and SYBR green (Life
Technologies) in triplicate. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH (Supplemental
Table 1). SUSD3 primers were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).
siRNA Transfection
MCF7 and T47D cells were transfected with ERα, SUSD3, and non-targeting control
siRNA (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Life
Technologies). SUSD3 siRNA target sequences employed are shown in Supplemental Table
1.

Author Manuscript

Flow Cytometry
Control and siRNA transfected SUSD3 cells were serum starved prior to vehicle or E2
treatment for 24h. Cells were prepared as previously described52,53, with minor
modifications. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, and
immunostained with phosphorylated histone H3 Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide solution and the mitotic
index was determined by flow cytometry as percentage of phosphorylated histone H3
positive cells in the population.
Generation and purification of SUSD3 antibody

Author Manuscript

A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against SUSD3 (AA 151 to 170). The
peptide sequence, CKDEDLETVQAAYLGLKHFNK, was custom made by Princeton
BioMolecules (Langhorne, PA). A cysteine residue was added to the N-terminus for
conjugation purposes. Animal immunization, serum collection, and affinity purification
were performed by Covance (Princeton, NJ). ELISA was performed to monitor titers and
confirm animals’ responses to the antigen. Specificity of the affinity purified SUSD3
antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting.
Rescue Experiment

Author Manuscript

The silencing resistant SUSD3-GFP expression construct was generated by introducing
three silent mutations within the siRNA targeting sequence of pCMV6-AC-SUSD3-GFP.
Site directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange Lightning Site Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Non-silenceable SUSD3 was
subcloned as a C-terminal EGFP fusion protein into the retroviral expression vector
pBABE-puro. Sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. VSV-G
pseudotyped retrovirus was produced in 293T/17 cells and used to transduce MCF7 cells as
described elsewhere54. Stable pools of MCF7 cells expressing SUSD3-EGFP or EGFP alone
were selected using 2μg/ml puromycin beginning two days post-transduction. For rescue
experiments, the siRNA resistant pCMV6-AC-SUSD3-GFP construct was co-transfected
into MCF7 cells together with the oligonucleotides used shown in Supplemental Table 1.

Alternately, GFP-only and SUSD3-GFP stable cell lines were transfected with SUSD3 and
control-siRNA.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as described previously48 with samples resolved on 4-12%
Ready Gel precise Gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA), transferred onto PVDF membranes, and
probed using primary antibodies: anti-phosphorylated FAK (Millipore, Billerica, MA), antiFAK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and anti-SUSD3. Equal loading was confirmed using
anti-β-actin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Anti-mouse and rabbit IgG secondary
antibodies were used (Cell Signaling). Western blots were developed using Amersham ECL

5′-Rapid Amplification of Complementary DNA Ends (5′-RACE)
The SUSD3 transcription start site (TSS) was determined by RNA ligase-mediated 5’ end
cDNA amplification with First-Choice RLM-RACE (Life Technologies) following
manufacturer's protocols. RACE products were cloned into the pCR-TOPO TA vector and
sequenced.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

ChIP was conducted as described previously, with minor modifications55. Sonicated
samples were incubated overnight with ERα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) and immunoprecipitated with Dynal magnetic beads (Life Technologies). Mock
precipitation with pre-immune IgG was performed. For quantitative detection of retained
DNA, qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate. SUSD3 gene primers were designed that span
10kb upstream of exon 1. TFF1 was used as a positive control (Supplemental Table 1).
Confocal Imaging

Author Manuscript

SUSD3 localization experiments were performed in MCF7 and T47D cells plated on glass
coverslips. After allowing the cells to attach overnight, they were transfected with a GFPtagged ORF clone of SUSD3 (OriGene, Rockville, MD) using FuGENE HD transfection
reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's protocol. Images were taken
with the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope and analyzed with LSM
Image Browser 4.2 (Carl Zeiss). siRNA transfected cells were fixed with formaldehyde,
treated with 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), washed, and sequentially overlaid with

Cell Surface Area and Cell Symmetry Ratio Measurement

Author Manuscript

Subconfluent control or SUSD3-depleted MCF7 cells were imaged 72h post-transfection.
Surface area of individual cells was determined using Image J lasso tool. A minimum of 50
cells per experiment were measured and the average surface area was calculated. Cell
symmetry ratio was determined by taking the ratio of two perpendicular diameters of each
cell, with higher value used as the numerator.
Mechanical Strength Assay

Hanging Drop Aggregation Assay

Author Manuscript

Confluent control or SUSD3 siRNA-transfected MCF7 cells in 6-well plates were washed
with PBS and incubated with 2.4U/ml dispase (Roche) for 30min at 37°C. Released
monolayers were fixed by formalin and fragments were counted using an MZ6 dissecting
scope (Leica, Germany) as described previously56 imaged with a Hamamatsu Orca digital
camera and analyzed using MetaVue imaging software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown,
PA). Under experimental conditions where fragmentation was excessive, a maximum of 400
fragments was counted.

Rho/Rac Activation Assays

Aggregation assay was performed as described previously57, with modifications56 20-μl
drops of cell suspensions (4000 cells) were seeded onto inner surfaces of 35-mm culture
dish lids and cultured for 20h. To examine the ability of cells to form aggregates, culture
dish lids were inverted, and hanging drops were flattened with coverslips for imaging. To
examine the adhesive strength of cellular aggregates, parallel cultures were triturated 10
times through a 20-μl pipette tip. Five random fields of phase-contrast images from each
drop were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a Zeiss Axiocam
camera and Zeiss Axiovision software. Total number of cells in clusters of 1-20, 21-100, or
>100 cells was counted from triplicate hanging drops; percentage of cells in the clusters and
total number of fragments were determined.

RhoA- and Rac-GTP levels were detected using colorimetric GLISA activation assays
(Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), according to manufacturer's protocol. Signal produced by the
detection reagent, proportional to the amount of Rho- or Rac-GTP, was detected by
measuring absorbance at 490nm using a Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).
Constitutively active Rho and Rac were used as positive controls.
Scratch Wound Assay

Author Manuscript

MCF7 and T47D cells were transfected for 72h with control or SUSD3 siRNAs in 6-well
plates. Cell monolayers were wounded with a 20-μl pipette tip, washed and submerged in
media with or without 40μg/ml mytomycin C to prevent cell division. Cells were imaged
immediately, 24, 48, and 72h after wounding. Percentage wound closure was determined
using Image J software.

TUNEL Assay

Author Manuscript

For TUNEL assay, MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured on glass coverslips. Cells were
fixed, permeabilized and TUNEL assay was performed using the ApopTag Red detection kit
(Chemicon, Inc.) following manufacturer's protocol. Samples were counterstained with
DAPI before mounting. Cells were visualized using fluorescent microscopy.
Statistical Methods

Author Manuscript

Cell culture experiments were carried out in minimum 3 replicates. Values are given as
mean with error bars indicating standard deviations. Statistical analyses were conducted
using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, USA). All statistical tests were 2-sided.
Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test for line and bar graph comparisons were
performed. Pearson correlation analysis was performed for ERα and SUSD3 expression
levels in breast cancer tumor samples. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

control or SUSD3 siRNA with cortical actin staining absent (no ring), or present over one
third (one third), one half (one half), two thirds (two thirds) or whole cell border (complete).
(e) Cell symmetry ratio measurements of control (siCTL) and SUSD3-knockdown
(siSUSD3 oligo 4) MCF7 cells. A total of 50 cells were measured in each population. The
closer the ratio to 1, the more circular or cuboidal the cell. ***, p < 0.001.

SUSD3 knockdown deregulates FAK/Rho-mediated focal adhesion dynamics. (a)
Immunofluorescent staining of control (siCTL) and SUSD3-knockdown (siSUSD3 oligo 4)
MCF7 cells was performed after a 72h transfection with Alexa-568 phalloidin-actin and
Alexa-647 paxillin. White arrows in siCTL cells point to focal adhesions anchoring to stress
fibers. Yellow arrows in siSUSD3 cells point to thickened cortical actin. (b) Rac and Rhoactivation assays. (c) Immunoblot analysis of FAK and phosphorylated (activated) FAK.
Control (Lane 1) vs. siSUSD3 oligo 4 (Lane 2) transfected MCF7 cells. β-actin was used as
