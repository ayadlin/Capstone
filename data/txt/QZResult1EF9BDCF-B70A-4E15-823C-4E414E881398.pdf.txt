Cetuximab/C225-Induced Intracellular Trafficking
of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor

Abstract
The monoclonal antibody C225 interacts with the ectodomain
of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) to block
ligand binding and initiates receptor endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. The data herein show that C225-dependent
EGFR trafficking relocalizes the receptor to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and nucleus. This mechanism, which also involves interaction of the C225-internalized receptor with the
Sec61 translocon within the ER, is, in most respects, analogous
to the pathway previously described for EGF-induced trafficking to the ER and nucleus. However, although inhibition of
receptor tyrosine kinase activity blocks EGF-induced nuclear
localization of the receptor, the same kinase inhibitors stimulate C225-dependent nuclear localization of EGFR in the
nucleus. In contrast, the kinase inhibitor Lapatinib fails to
stimulate nuclear accumulation of the receptor in C225-treated
cells and does not provoke receptor dimerization as do
inhibitors that recognize the open conformation of the receptor
kinase. This suggests that inhibitor-dependent receptor dimerization may facilitate C225-induced receptor trafficking.

Introduction
Agents that prevent the activation of the epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinases
are prominent in current clinical practice and trials. Among these
is the C225 monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab, Erbitux) that blocks
growth factor binding to EGFR (1, 2). Crystallographic analysis
shows that the antibody binding site overlaps the ligand binding
site (3). This reagent is approved for the treatment of colon and
head and neck tumors and is in clinical trials for other cancers (4).
In many tumor cell lines, C225 provokes growth arrest (5–11),
whereas in a few, cell death is induced (12, 13). Whether these
responses are mediated by the antibody’s capacity to interact with
the EGFR ligand binding site is unclear. The binding of C225 to the
ectodomain of EGFR does not provoke a significant level of
receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, but does bring about receptor
internalization by an uncertain route (14, 15). The internalized
receptor is not extensively processed to the lysosome, but rather is
recycled to the cell surface (16). Whether the bound antibody is
also recycled is not known. Also, it is not known whether antibodyinduced trafficking of the receptor is related to the antibody’s
biological activity.

EGF provokes nuclear localization of full-length EGFR (17), and a
novel intracellular trafficking pathway has been identified for this
intracellular destination (18). This pathway involves sorting of the
internalized cell surface receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and its interaction with the Sec61 translocon, which facilitates
bidirectional movement of proteins, including transmembrane proteins, between the cytoplasm and the ER. The Sec61 complex is able
to retrotranslocate the mature EGFR from the ER to the cytosol, as a
prerequisite for receptor translocation to the nucleus (18). This
pathway is required for EGF to induce cyclin D and therefore
constitutes a signal transduction pathway (17).
In this article, we present an evaluation of the capacity of C225
to induce intracellular translocation of EGFR to the ER, its interaction with the Sec61 trafficking pathway, and nuclear localization.

Materials and Methods
Materials. DMEM containing L-glutamine and high glucose, Ham’s F-12
medium, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 from American
Type Culture Collection. Recombinant human EGF was obtained from
R & D Systems, Inc. DiFi cells, C225, and 528 antibodies were the gifts
from Dr. Robert Coffey, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Mouse
monoclonal antibody 455 was from Oncogene. Fab fragments of C225
were generously provided by Dr. Carlos Arteaga, Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN. EGFR kinase inhibitor AG 1478 was from Calbiochem.
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was from Invitrogen. Antibodies to EGFR and
Sec61hwere from Upstate, Inc. Antibody to HDAC was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. The pDsRed2-ER construct (calreticulinfRFP) was
from Clontech. The EGFRfmGFP construct was previously described
(18). Lapatinib was a generous gift obtained from Drs. William Bronnann
and Ashotosh Pal, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.
Cell culture and treatment. MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS. DiFi cells were maintained in a mixture of DMEM and
Ham’s F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) with 10% FBS. Cultures were incubated in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Forty percent to 50% confluent cells were
incubated for overnight in DMEM ( for MDA-MB-468) or DMEM and F-12
(1:1 v/v) plus 0.5% FBS before treatment with EGF (4 nmol/L) or C225
(5 nmol/L) for the indicated times.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and SDS lysates. The nuclear
fractionation protocol was described previously (17, 18). Briefly, cells in a
10-cm dish were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and removed with a rubber
cell scraper in 1 mL Buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl,
2 mmol/L MgCl2, protease inhibitor tablet with EDTA at 1 tablet/10 mL]
containing 1% NP40. Cells were disrupted by 10 passes through a 21-gauge
needle, and the extent of nuclear isolation was monitored microscopically.
Nuclei were centrifuged (500  g, 5 min) and washed once with Buffer A.
The resulting supernatant was designated as the nonnuclear fraction. The
nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 AL Buffer A supplemented with
500 mmol/L NaCl and 25% glycerol, and kept on ice for 30 min. Samples
were centrifuged (12,000  g, 5 min), and the supernatant (nuclear extracts)
was aliquoted and frozen at 1jC to 80jC. The pellet (SDS lysate) was
solubilized in 1 SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer.
Coprecipitation and Western blotting. Cells were lysed in cold Buffer
A containing 1% NP40 and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation

(12,000  g, 5 min), Sec61h antibody and Protein A beads were added to the
supernatant and incubated overnight. The precipitate was then washed
thrice with Buffer A. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes, the samples were probed with the indicated antibody. For
Western blots, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibody. Bound
antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Confocal microscopy. MDA-MB-468 cells were cotransfected with
pEGFRfmGFP and pDsRed2-ER DNA (Clontech) using Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturer instruction. The cells were subcultured
(1:1 split) 24 h after transfection and placed into normal culture medium for
24 h. Cells were serum starved overnight and incubated with or without
C225 (5 nmol/L) for the indicated time. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss
LSM510 confocal scanning microscope and a Plan-Neofluar 40  1.3 NA oil
immersion lens was used for imaging all the samples with a 1 Am optical
slice. GFP was excited with an argon laser with excitation at 488 nm and
RFP was excited at a 543 nm. The emission was detected with filter sets
(505–550 band pass for GFP and 560 long pass for RFP). Image analysis was
performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Line
intensity scan was used to show colocalization of GFP and RFP.

Results
C225-induced nuclear localization of EGFR. To assess the
capacity of C225 to provoke translocation of EGFR to the nucleus,
the experiment described in Fig. 1 was performed. MDA-MB-468
cells were incubated with EGF or C225 for increasing periods of
time. Cell fractionation was used to prepare a nuclear fraction and
this was extracted with high-salt to release nonmembrane and
nonchromatin bound molecules (17). EGF induced translocation of
receptor to the salt-extracted nuclear fraction with the appearance
of intact receptor together with 150 kDa and 130 kDa degradation
products, which have previously been reported to represent the loss

of ectodomain residues (18). Incubation with C225 induced a similar time course of receptor translocation to the salt-extracted nuclear fraction, but with a substantially decreased level of the lower
molecular mass fragments and increased retention of the native
170-kDa receptor species. Upon longer exposure (Fig. 1, middle), it
is clear that the similar receptor fragments are produced following
treatment with C225, but at a markedly lower level compared with
EGF. Exposure of MDA-MB-468 cells to C225 for 3 hours does not
alter the total level of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine whether the capacity of C225 to provoke nuclear
localization of the EGFR was specific to that antibody, two other
antibodies to the EGFR plus a Fab fragment of C225 were tested.
The results are presented in Fig. 2 and indicate that antibodies
C225 or 528, but not antibody 445 or the Fab C225, induce substantial levels of nuclear EGFR. Interestingly, both C225 and 528
block EGF binding to EGFR (2) and it is clear from structural data
that C225 directly contacts the ligand binding site (3). Antibody
445, which does recognize the EGFR ectodomain, does not block
ligand binding (2). The results with C225 Fab indicate that antibody
bivalence is necessary for the C225 effect on EGFR trafficking.
C225-dependent EGFR trafficking to the ER. In cells treated
with EGF, EGFR is slowly trafficked from the cell surface to the ER
before nuclear localization (18). This trafficking pathway was
examined in cells treated with C225. Cells were transfected to
coexpress the ER marker calreticulinfRFP and EGFR fmGFP.
The data in Fig. 3 show the individual signals produced by these
two proteins plus the overlap of the signals. In the absence of C225,
there is no overlap of the two markers. However, following addition
of C225 for 3 hours, there is substantial overlap (brown yellow) of
the calreticulin and EGFR signals, indicating ER localization of the
receptor. These results are very similar to those published for EGFinduced trafficking of EGFR to the ER (18). In this experiment, the
confocal plane was chosen to visualize the ER and the presence of
nuclear EGFR is not obvious in this plane.
The data in Fig. 1 indicate, based on extractability with high salt,
that nuclear EGFR is not membrane bound, similar to that reported for EGF-induced nuclear localization of the receptor (17, 18).
Following EGF treatment, extraction of the transmembrane EGFR
from the ER lipid bilayer is accomplished by retrotranslocation of the
receptor though the Sec61 translocon into the cytosol as a soluble

protein (18). In this process, EGFR association with the Sec61h
subunit can be detected in EGF-treated cells. The results shown in
Fig. 4A show that when cells are treated with C225, a time-dependent
association of EGFR and Sec61h is similarly detected. There is
detectable association at 30 min and a maximal level of association
at 1 h after addition of the antibody. This experiment has also been
accomplished in DiFi cells along with an additional control (Fig. 4B).
Incubation of C225 with cells at 4jC does not result in significant
coassociation, indicating that postlysis association is unlikely and
that active cell metabolism is required.
Influence of tyrosine kinase inhibition on C225-induced
nuclear EGFR. Because EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is reported

to be necessary for receptor internalization (19) and nuclear
localization (17, 18) following the addition of EGF, the influence of
kinase inhibitors was tested for C225-dependent nuclear localization of EGFR. Surprisingly, the results shown in Fig. 5 show that
AG1478 significantly potentiates C225-dependent EGFR nuclear
localization in both MDA-MB-468 (A) and DiFi (B) cells. In the
experiment with MDA-MB-468 cells, EGFR nuclear localization
following the addition of EGF was also assessed. As previously
reported (17, 18), the kinase inhibitor prevented growth factorinduced nuclear translocation of EGFR. Also, this experiment
allows a direct comparison of the levels of nuclear EGFR at
the same time point following exposure to EGF or C225. Clearly,

Figure 5. Influence of EGFR kinase inhibition on C225-induced EGFR translocation to the nucleus. MDA-MB-468 (A ) and DiFi (B) cells were preincubated with or
without AG1478 (1 Amol/L) for 30 min before incubation with EGF or C225 for 3 h. Aliquots of nuclear high-salt extracts were blotted with anti-EGFR. The same
blots were reblotted with anti-HDAC1, a nuclear marker. Arrows, the 170 kDa full-length EGFR plus receptor fragments of 150 and 130 kDa.

C225 provokes a significantly greater level of nuclear receptor at the
same period of incubation time. When this experiment
was repeated using other EGFR kinase inhibitors (Tarceva, Iressa)
the results were similar to those obtained with AG1478 (data
no shown). Lapatinib, however, did not increase the C225dependent EGFR presence in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 6A, lanes
3 and 4).

AG1478, Iressa, and Tarceva are thought to bind to an open
conformation of the EGFR kinase (20, 21), whereas Lapatinib is
reported to bind to a closed conformation of the kinase (22). Also,
it has been shown that AG1478 and related inhibitors provoke
dimerization of receptor EGFR in cells (23, 24). Therefore, we tested
whether Lapatinib could also produce receptor dimerization. The
data shown in Fig. 6B show that, although AG1478 (lane 9), C225
(lane 10), or EGF (lane 12) provoked receptor dimerization,
Lapatinib does not increase EGFR dimerization. These data show
that following treated with AG1478 plus C225 (lane 11) the level of
receptor dimer was greater than that with C225 alone (lane 10).
Under the same conditions, Iressa and Tarceva did provoke EGFR
dimerization (data not shown).

The manner in which EGF induces internalization and intracellular trafficking of the EGFR has been described in detail (19).
The ligand induces rapid receptor internalization in a manner that
requires receptor tyrosine kinase activity for entrance into clathrincoated pits. When the receptor is overexpressed, there is evidence
that kinase-independent slow internalization can occur, but the mechanism of internalization is unclear. In the case of C225 antibodyinduced internalization, it is known that receptor kinase activity is
not necessary and that the internalization process is slow compared
with ligand-dependent internalization (16).
Once endocytosis has occurred, it is well established that ligand/
receptor complexes are trafficked primarily to the lysosome, but
also can be recycled to the cell surface (19). Recently, it has been
reported that EGF also induces intracellular trafficking of a small
fraction of the receptor to the ER (18). In the ER, the receptor
interacts with the Sec61 translocon and is thereby exported from
the ER to the cytosol and subsequently translocates into the nucleus.
Nuclear localization sequences have been reported for residues
within the intracellular domain (25).
In the case of antibody-dependent intracellular trafficking of the
EGFR, most of the internalized antibody/receptor complex is recycled
to the cell surface (16). Whether any of the antibody-internalized
receptor is trafficked to the lysosome is not known directly. However,
because C225 and other receptor antibodies provoke a slow downregulation of the receptor (8, 16, 26, 27), it seems likely that some

receptor is degraded in the lysosomes. The data in this article show
an additional destination for antibody-dependent internalized
EGFR. In this trafficking route, the receptor is trafficked to the ER,
interacts with the Sec61 translocon, and is ultimate found in the
nucleus. The most significant difference for trafficking of the receptor
through this pathway under the influence ligand or antibody is tyrosine
kinase activity requirement for EGF-induced nuclear localization, but
not for antibody-induced nuclear localization. This difference in kinase
activity requirement is most likely due to the kinase requirement for
ligand-dependent entry of receptor into coated pits, whereas C225induced cellular entry may occur through a different cell surface
portal. Whether C225 translocation of the EGFR to the nucleus influences the biological responses of cells to the antibody is not known.
Other extracellular ligands that are trafficked by their receptors
from the cell surface to the ER include certain toxins (28) and the
SV40 virus (29). In neither case is there a reported requirement for
tyrosine kinase activity, and for each of these two different ligands,
the Sec61 translocon mediates export from the ER. In the case of
toxins, export is to the cytoplasm, whereas for the virus, cytoplasmic localization would seem to be a precursor step for nuclear
localization. Neither toxin nor virus is internalized through coated
pits, but rather are internalized through caveolae. Based on our
results with C225-dependent receptor trafficking, it would seem
that receptor trafficking to the ER and nucleus occurs in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity.

The mechanism by which some tyrosine kinase inhibitors
potentiate antibody-induced receptor trafficking to nucleus is not
clear. Based on the fact that Lapatinib, which binds to a closed
kinase conformation, fails to provoke receptor dimerization or
C225-dependent nuclear localization of the receptor, the most
likely mechanism might seem to be that inhibitors, such as, AG1478
stabilize an inactive open form of receptor dimer at the cell
surface and this may provide for either enhanced antibody association and/or for a more efficiently internalized antibody/
receptor complex.
