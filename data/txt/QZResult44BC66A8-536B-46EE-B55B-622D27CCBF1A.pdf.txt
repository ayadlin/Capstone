ABSTRACT
Nucleolin (NCL) is highly expressed in several types of cancer and represents
an interesting therapeutic target. It is expressed at the plasma membrane of tumor
cells, a property which is being used as a marker for several human cancer including
glioblastoma. In this study we investigated targeting NCL as a new therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of this pathology. To explore this possibility, we studied the effect
of an antagonist of NCL, the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L using primary culture
of human glioblastoma cells. In this system, N6L inhibits cell growth with different
sensitivity depending to NCL localization. Cell cycle analysis indicated that N6L-induced
growth reduction was due to a block of the G1/S transition with down-regulation of
the expression of cyclin D1 and B2. By monitoring autophagy markers such as p62 and
LC3II, we demonstrate that autophagy is enhanced after N6L treatment. In addition,
N6L-treatment of mice bearing tumor decreased in vivo tumor growth in orthotopic
brain tumor model and increase mice survival. The results obtained indicated an antiproliferative and pro-autophagic effect of N6L and point towards its possible use as
adjuvant agent to the standard therapeutic protocols presently utilized for glioblastoma.

proliferating cells where it plays different functions [1–3].
Accordingly, NCL is expressed at the plasma membrane of
tumor cells, a property which is being used as a marker of
several human cancer, including glioblastoma [4]. At cell
surface, NCL binds to several ligands including growth
factors such as midkine, pleitrophin, hepatocyte growth factor
and vascular endothelial growth factor [5–7].

INTRODUCTION
Nucleolin is a ribonucleoprotein over-expressed
in highly proliferative cells such as cancer cells [1]. This
ribonucleoprotein has been first described as a protein located
in the nucleolus, but it is now known that it can shuttle to
the nucleoplasm, the cytoplasm and the cell surface of

Accordingly, various ligands targeting cell-surface
nucleolin have been used to block tumor growth and
angiogenesis, including endostatin [8] aptamer AS1411
[9], F3 tumor-homing peptide [10] and the multivalent
pseudopeptide N6L [11]. N6L is composed of a short
template, rich in lysine residues on which six pseudotripeptide
Lysψ(CH2N)-Pro-Arg is covalently anchored [12].
N6L specifically targets cancer cells, exhibiting
anti-tumor activity in various human tumor cell lines
derived from mammary, colorectal carcinoma, melanoma
and glioblastoma (GB) [12]. This therapeutic peptide is
currently in phase I/IIa clinical trials (NCT01711398).
Since mature brain expresses important levels of NCL
during the differentiation of neural cells, it is reasonable
to suggest that NCL has a fundamental role in mediating
signals by extracellular matrix molecules, and furthermore
contributes to the differentiation and maintenance of neural
tissue [13]. Our previous data showed that in gliomas,
surface NCL localization increased with the malignancy

grade suggesting that NCL could be considered as a
histopathological marker for glioma grading [14], a tumor
difficult to be early diagnosed due to the faint appearance
of clear symptoms [15]. On the basis of these results, NCL
represents a potential tool for targeted therapy for gliomas,
and thus in this work the effects of N6L on human GB cells
in primary culture prepared form post-surgical specimens
and also in in vivo assays were investigated.

RESULTS
N6L inhibits GB cell growth in vitro with
different sensitivity depending on NCL
localization and N6L internalization
Effects of N6L on GB cells were studied using
primary cultures derived from surgical specimens
obtained from 15 patients. As shown in Figure 1, N6L

decreases cell viability in a time- and concentrationdependent manner. However, different sample sensitivity
to the treatment was observed according to the patient’s
source (Figure 1A and 1B). In fact, some samples were
highly sensitive to N6L other less sensitive with a GI50
ranging from 1.97 μM to 30 μM (Figure 1A). Possible
correlation between cells sensitivity to N6L and nucleolin
expression rate has been next investigated . Nucleolin is
abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of
the more N6L responsive cultures (Figure 1C), while it
is less abundant in cells which are less sensitive to N6L
(Figure 1D). In order to study the N6L internalization
into the cell cytoplasm, fluorescent N6L (fN6L) was
used (Figure 2). When GB cells were challenged with
40 μM fN6L, the more responsive cultures showed the
peptide strongly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus

(Figure 2A), whereas in the less responsive ones fN6L
was less abundantly present in the cytoplasm and not
localized in the nucleolus (Figure 2C). When cells were
challenged with 10 μM fN6L, the nucleolar positivity was
lost in both culture types, whereas in the more sensitive
cultures the membrane/cytoplasmatic positivity was
more apparent than in less sensitive cultures (Figure 2B
and 2D, respectively). These data indicate a more effective
internalization in the nucleolus and cytoplasm of N6L in
the more responsive cells, suggesting that the effect of
N6L occurred via its internalization.
Due to the differences of sensitivity and according
to the different GI50, the subsequent experiments were
performed using N6L at 10 μM in the responsive cultures
and at 40 μM in the less responsive ones. However, since
behaviors of the different parameters studied upon N6L

obtained in the different cultures (more responsive and
less responsive) were pooled and statistically analyzed.

of LC3, a marker of autophagosomes number (Figure 6C).
It is worth noting that LC3 is present also in the nucleus
in untreated cells (Figure 6C) and that it is known that
deacetylation of nuclear LC3 drives autophagy initiation,
inducing cytoplasmic translocation of LC3 [19]; accordingly,
upon N6L treatment, LC3 changed its localization, moving
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Figure 6C).
Since it is known that cytosolic p53 form inhibits
authophagic cell death, the cytosolic and nuclear forms of p53
have been studied (Figure 7). Upon treatment, the p53 nuclear
content is not affected (Figure 7A), while the cytoplasmic
form is significantly decreased at 48 h (Figure 7B). This is
also apparent in immunofluorescent studies (Figure 7C),
where the immunofluorescent localization of p53 upon
treatment showed an evident nuclear localization paralleled
by the decrease of cytoplasmic p53.

N6L inhibits cell cycle of GB cells in vitro
Effect of N6L on GB cell proliferation was
evaluated by BrdU incorporation (Figure 3). Upon N6L
challenge, BrdU incorporation was strongly decreased in
time dependent manner (Figure 3A). Accordingly, N6L
dramatically decreased both cyclin D1 (Figure 3B) and
cyclin B2 (Figure 3C) expression. To complete this data,
cytofluorimetric analysis for cell cycle was carried out
(Figure 4A and 4B). Cell cycle analysis using PI staining
and FACS analysis showed that after 24 h, N6L was able
to induce an increase of cells in G1 phase with concomitant
decrease of cells in the S and G2 phases, which is in
agreement with the decrease in the expression of cyclin D1.
Upon 48 h of treatment, control cells reached confluence and
were almost blocked in G1, while the treatment determined a
block in G2/M phase, in agreement with the decrease in the
expression of cyclin B2 observed (Figure 4C). These results
showing that N6L is able to perturb the cell cycle prompted
us to analyze the mechanism of action of N6L.

In vivo effects of N6L
Finally, in vivo studies were performed on BALB/cnu/nu athymic mice injected intracranially with U87 LUC
cells. The bioluminescence data, analyzed weekly, showed
a significant decrease of tumor growth in N6L treated mice
(Figure 8A and 8B). The mean light intensity detected
on day 21 for the group of mice treated with N6L was
lower than the control group (p = 0.0005). In addition,
the survival function shows that N6L was able to increase
mice survival until 6 weeks while 90% of untreated mice
were dead at 3 weeks (Figure 8C).

N6L inhibited cell migration of GB cells in vitro
Since N6L has been shown to inhibit metastasis [12],
we next investigated the effect of N6L on the migration of
GB cells. In Figure 5A cell migration in control and treated
cultures is reported; upon N6L challenge cell migration was
strongly decreased already at 24 h in all culture analyzed.
Consistently, N6L dramatically decreases both the active
form of ErbB1 receptor (EGFR) (Figure 5B) and ERK1/2
(Figure 5C), known to be implicated in proliferation,
migration and invasion of glioma cells [16–17].

DISCUSSION
Many studies showed that cell-surface NCL plays
a crucial role in tumor growth as well as in angiogenesis
[10–11; 20]. Recently, our group has shown that surface
NCL is increased with the malignancy grade of gliomas,
suggesting that it may constitute a histopathological
marker for glioma grading and a potential tool for targeted
therapy [14]. GB is the most invasive and aggressive brain
tumor in humans, and despite the latest chemical and
radiation approaches, it is still poorly sensitive to these
treatments and is considered an incurable disease [15].
Therefore, functional blockade of cell surface NCL with
an antagonist such as N6L may represent an innovative
therapy against this kind of tumor.
In this study, we investigated the biological role of N6L
on primary cultures of human GB, that represent much more
than the cell lines, the individual response to pharmacological
treatment, due to their different biomolecular profile. In
agreement with previously published data [12], we found
that N6L significantly reduced cell viability of human GB
primary culture at any time and concentration considered.
It is noteworthy that the sensitivity of the N6L depends on
the NCL expression profile of each patient. In fact, many
cultures appeared extremely sensitive to the treatment with
N6L, while other cultures from different patients appeared

N6L induced autophagy in glioblastoma cells
in vitro
Since the nucleosome concentration was not
significantly modulated upon N6L treatment (data not
shown) suggesting that the effect of N6L occurs through a
mechanism different from apoptosis, the autophagic markers
were investigated including p62, LC3I and II (Figure 6).
Since it is known that p62 is selectively incorporated into
autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3 and that
it is efficiently degraded by autophagy [18], generally
the total cellular levels of p62 inversely correlate with
the autophagic activity. Accordingly, in our experimental
conditions, As reported in Figure 6A, p62 was significantly
decreased by N6L at 48 h, thus indicating that N6L is able
to induce autophagic death. Accordingly, the ratio LC3 II/
LC3I was increased by treatment with chloroquine (CQ)+
N6L (Figure 6B). These findings were further confirmed by
the strong increase, upon treatment, of the “punctata” form

less responsive to N6L. This different response is linked to
the different expression of surface/cytoplamic NCL in the
two sets of GB cultures, where NCL was abundantly present
in the responsive cultures, while it was less abundant in
the other cultures. This data was further confirmed by the
N6L internalization study, showing that N6L was much

more internalized in the responsive cultures than in the less
responsive ones. The internalization of N6L was paralleled by
the significant inhibition of cell proliferation accompanied by
a dramatically decrease of cyclin D1 and cyclin B2. In fact,
a blockage in G1 phase at 24 h and in G2/M at 48 h were
promoted by N6L treatment.

In our experimental conditions, unlike previous
experiments on different cancer cells lines [12], we did
not observed apoptosis induction upon N6L treatment, nor
by cytofluorimetry or nucleosome concentration (data not
shown). This may be due to the different tumor considered
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the previous study but also to the fact that we use
primary cultures from GB patients. Moreover, we showed
that N6L induced autophagic cell death as demonstrated
by the increased protein levels of LC3II in the presence of
CQ and by the decreased protein levels of p62, the two key

components in the formation of autophagosomes, and by
the strong increase of the “punctata” form of LC3 and by
the LC3 redistribution from nucleus to cytoplasm.
Interestingly, N6L induced autophagic process
through a decrease of the cytoplasmic p53. In fact,
it is known that p53 plays a dual role in the control of
autophagy. On one hand, nuclear p53 induces autophagy
through its transcriptional effects, on the other hand,
cytoplasmic p53 acts as a master repressor of autophagy
[21]. Autophagy is a conserved mechanism that cells
utilize to degrade intracellular long-lived proteins and
organelles through lysosome-mediated degradation.
Depending on the stimulus and the tumor cell type,
autophagy can either act to protect tumor cells from a toxic
stress or can facilitate the toxicity of the stress [22]. In
agreement with the role of autophagy in the enhancement
of the toxicity level of many anticancer compounds
in tumor cells, N6L increased LC3 II processing and
decreased p62. Interestingly, it has been reported that p62
itself has oncogenic functions [23–25]. N6L, therefore,
by triggering autophagy, may inhibit tumorigenesis by
limiting p62 availability.
Since it was demonstrated that NCL interacts with
EGFR leading to receptor dimerization and activation [26]
with consequent promotion of proliferation and migration,
we decided also to investigate the effects of N6L on EGFR
activation. A dramatically decrease of the activation of
EGFR and pERK1/2 which is the downstream effector,
was observed. Similar data has been observed with a
polyplexed form on N6L tested on U87-MG line cells
(unpublished data). On the basis of the implication of
EGFR not only in proliferation, but also in migration of
glioma cells [16–17], we also assayed cell migration and
found that it was strongly decreased upon N6L treatment.
Our results are in agreement with those of Farin and coll.,
that suggested the use of aptamer-targeting NCL on GB
cell lines, as a new strategy to inhibit the activation of
EGFR- and Ras-driven cancers [27].
We therefore propose N6L as possible adjuvant
agent to the standard therapeutic protocols presently
utilized for GB. In fact, in preliminary in vitro
experiments (Supplementary Figure S1), we observed
that N6L, in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ),
resulted effective in significantly reducing cell viability
with respect to N6L and TMZ alone. Moreover we also
observed that N6L was more effective in inducing cell
death than TMZ, even if it was administered at 10–40 μM
with respect to the higher TMZ concentration utilized
(1 mM). Finally, in vitro data were confirmed by in vivo
studies, showing that N6L decreases tumor growth and
increases mice survival until 6 weeks.
All together our results, obtained in different sets of
primary culture of GB derived from surgical specimens of
patients, show for the first time a strong pro-autophagic,
anti-proliferative and anti-migrative effect of N6L.
Interestingly, recent data showed that treatment of glioma
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells with autophagy inducing agents such as Tamoxifen
increases the efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses treat­
ment [28]. A different study demonstrated that combined
treatment including those targeting nucleolin and Ras may
represent an additional opportunity for inhibiting GB [29].
According to these data, it is tempting to speculate that
combined treatments of N6L with molecules targeting
overexpressed oncogenes represent an interesting way to
treat cancer patient.

DMEM containing 5% FBS. The protein levels of LC3
were assayed by Western blotting and immufluorescence
experiments as described below.

Cell treatments
Cells were seed at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 and
all treatments were performed one day after plating. For
cell viability, N6L was tested at 24, 48 and 72 hours at
increasing concentrations, ranging from 10 μM to 50 μM
in DMEM containing 5% FBS. Temozolomide (TMZ),
was dissolved in DMSO and the cell viability was tested

Western blotting
For Western blotting, cell lysates in ice-cold
RIPA buffer were centrifuged and the supernatants
were assayed for protein content. About 20 to 30 μg of
proteins were fractionated on 7.5–15% polyacrylamide
gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane from Millipore
Corporation (Billerica, MA, USA). Nonspecific binding
sites were blocked for 1 hour at RT in 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4) buffer, 55 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween
20 containing 5% non-fat dry milk (blocking buffer).
Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Primary
antibodies used are anti-LC3, anti-cyclin D1, anti-p62,
anti-actin and anti-pERK1,2 antibodies from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), anti-p53 and anti-pEGFR
antibodies from Santacruz Biotectnology (SantaCruz,
CA, USA), anti-cyclin B2 was from Abcam (Cambridge
Science Park, Cambridge, UK). All these antibodies are
dissolved in blocking solution. After extensive washings
and incubation with the respective horseradish peroxidaselabeled secondary antibodies, protein presence was
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction
from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL, USA). Band
relative densities obtained using Alliance 4.7 UVITEC
(Cambridge, UK) were normalized to actin and values
were given as relative units (R.U.).

N6L internalization
Cells were seed at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 and
one day after plating were treated with 40 μM or 10 μM
of N6L-Alexa 488 (fN6L) in DMEM containing 5% FBS,
for 30 minutes at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere.
Subsequently, the cells were extensive washed with PBS
and fixed for 10 min at RT in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium
containing DAPI and photographed at confocal microscope
LEICA TCS SP2 (LEICA, Mannheim, Germany).

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded (2500 cells/well) in a 96 wells
plate in presence or absence of treatment (every treatment
was performed in triplicate) and incubated for indicated
time in the figure. At expiration of incubation period cell
viability was determined using Cell Titer One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega, Lyon, France) reading the
absorbance at 492 nm, in a spectrophotometric microplate
reader Infinite F200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Swiss). The results
are expressed as ratio between the absorbance of treated
cells compared to absorbance of control untreated cells.

followed by Scheffe’s post hoc test” analysis. *P < 0.05;
**P < 0.005, **P < 0.0005. Data were expressed as mean
± SE of 4 separate experiments.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration assay has been carrier with RTCA
DP Instrument (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA)
using 16-well plates which has an upper chamber, sealed
at the bottom with a microporous (8 μm of diameter)
PET membrane coated with 0.1% gelatin using FBS as
chemoattractant.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Orthotopic implantation of tumor cells and
treatment

The Authors declare that there is not conflict of
interest.

U87-LUC cells were injected (1.5 × 105 in 3 μL
HBSS) into the right striatum (coordinates :1 mm lateral to
the middle line and depth 3.5 mm) through a burr hole in
the skull using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe to deliver tumor
cells to a intraparenchymal depth of 4-week-old female
BALB/c-nu/nu athymic mice (Charles River Laboratories
France) anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cock­
tail solution. The mice were treated by intraperitoneal
injection with 10 mg/kg body weight of N6L or vehicle as
control for 5 days/week from day 1 post-cell inoculation
for 4 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored and measured
via bioluminescence imaging in vivo by intraperitoneal
injection of 100 mg/kg of body weight of D-luciferin using
the Aequoria 2D luminescence imaging system according
to the recommended procedure (Hamamatsu Photonics,
Naka-ku, Japan). Animals were daily monitored for
cachexia (evaluated by body weight waste), behavior and
survival. Animals that lost about 20% of the body weight
were euthanized.
