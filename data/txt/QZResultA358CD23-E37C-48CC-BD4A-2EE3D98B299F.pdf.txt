BACKGROUND: Despite frequent anemia and multiple transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia , recommendations for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs) in these populations are still missing. The primary objective was the effect of ESA administration on patient’s quality of life
(QoL). Secondary objectives were hemoglobin (Hb) recovery, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, overall survival, and event-free survival. METHODS: Adult patients with Hb  11 g/dL after consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (group 1), or after
allo-HSCT for any hematological diseases (group 2), were prospectively included. ESA was administered subcutaneously once per
week during a maximum period of 6 months and was stopped when Hb level reached 12 g/dL. A paired-matched analysis using a historical control group was performed for secondary endpoints. Fifty-two patients were included in group 1, and 55 patients were in
group 2. RESULTS: For the global population, a significant improvement of QoL was noticed with ESA use; 83% (group 1) and 71%
(group 2) of patients achieved an Hb level  12 g/dL without transfusion requirement. The pair-matched analysis showed a reduction
of 4 RBC units per patient in group 1 (P ¼ .0002) and 3 RBC units per patient in group 2 (P ¼ .04). No significant difference in terms
of thromboembolic events, overall survival, and event-free survival was observed between ESA and control groups. A RBC transfusion
median savings of €1712 per patient was estimated in each group. CONCLUSIONS: ESAs have a clinical and economic benefit on Hb
recovery, could improve a patient’s QoL, and lead to a significant reduction in number of RBC transfusions with no effect on survival.

Anemia, defined as a deficiency in red blood cells (RBCs), is the most common hematological abnormality among cancer
patients1,2; it is associated with poor prognosis and outcomes,3,4 with a detrimental impact on patient condition and quality
of life (QoL).5,6 The usual method used to treat anemia is RBC transfusions, which have only a short-lived therapeutic effect
and are associated with 1) short-term life-threatening risks, such as exposure to infectious agents7 and the more common risk
of transfusion-related acute lung injury,8 and 2) long-term life-threatening risks, especially iron overload.9,10 Erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs) are currently the only therapeutic alternative to transfusions. The use of ESA remains very common in patients treated by chemotherapy for solid tumors11–13 and lymphoid malignancies.14,15 Recently, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published an updated guideline on the
use of ESA in adult patients with cancer16 that recommends a strict benefit/risk evaluation by clinicians for its use compared
with RBC transfusions. Many clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that ESAs are generally well-tolerated in
patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.11,17–24 At the same time, results from other clinical trials have shown a negative
impact on survival and/or disease control.25–29 There are also safety concerns with ESAs, including the established increased
risk of venous thromboembolic events.30,31 In patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the use of ESAs has not been clearly assessed and is
still controversial, which explains the need for prospective evaluation of ESAs in these 2 populations.
In our current prospective study, as primary objective, we evaluated the effect of ESA administration in anemic
patients after either consolidation therapy for AML in complete remission (CR) or after allo-HSCT for hematological diseases, on patient QoL. Secondary objectives evaluated the impact of ESA administration on hemoglobin (Hb) recovery,

the number of RBC transfusion units, and overall and
event-free survival (OS and EFS). All secondary endpoints
were achieved using a paired matched analysis. Total
direct costs regarding transfusions and ESA administration were calculated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

This prospective study included adult patients with Hb
level  11 g/dL after consolidation chemotherapy (first,
second, or third) for AML in CR (group 1); or after alloHSCT for any hematological disease (group 2); or with
no ESA therapy received within 3 weeks before study initiation (control). Patients with pregnancy, lactation, a history of thromboembolic events, uncontrolled
hypertension, and/or concomitant cardiac, neurological,
digestive, or pulmonary disease that would compromise
the study outcomes were excluded from this study. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants.
Matched Population

Patients in both groups were matched and compared to a
historical population followed and treated at the same hospital with the only difference of not receiving ESA. The
matching analysis takes into account sex, age, and disease
status for the 2 groups; associated with cytogenetics, type,
and number of chemotherapy for group 1; and diagnosis,
conditioning, HSC source, related or unrelated donor,
human leukocyte antigen matching, number of previous
transplants, and graft-versus-host disease for group 2.
Study Design and ESA Administration

This study was undertaken between April 2006 and December 2009 at the Hematology Department of Edouard
Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France. The design and study
conduct complied with good clinical practice, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved
by the French ethics committee. ESA was administered
subcutaneously (sc) once per week during a maximum period of 6 months: for group 1, Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa
injection) at 150 lg; for group 2, NeoRecormon (epoetin
beta) at 30,000 IU. Hemoglobin level was monitored every week; injections were stopped once the Hb level
reached 12 g/dL without any transfusion support. If after
4 injections, no improvement (increase of Hb < 1 g/dL or
no decrease of RBC transfusion requirements) in Hb level
was observed, doses were doubled, and if no improvement
was observed after 8 injections, patient was taken offstudy for ESA inefficiency. Transfusions were allowed as
clinically indicated when the Hb level was  7 g/dL dur108

Quality of Life

The QoL was measured by patient completion of the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (Total
FACT-An), which consists of the FACT-General (FACTG) questionnaire, FACT-Fatigue (FACT-F), and FACTAnemia (FACT-An) subscales.32 The QoL was measured
at baseline, then patients were seen and evaluated at 1, 2,
3, and 6 months after study entry.
Hb Response Evaluation and Safety Assessment

Considering the Hb level, the CR (ESA CR) was defined
as Hb level  12 g/dL; the Hb partial response (ESA PR)
was defined as a  2 g/dL Hb increase, compared with the
baseline value without any transfusion requirement.
Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded
continuously throughout the study period, using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3, of
the US National Cancer Institute.
Economic Assessment

Major resources used and direct medical costs that were
related to transfusions and ESA administration were identified for each patient. Number of ESA injections (inside
and outside hospitalization) and number of RBC transfusions were recorded. The ESA and RBC transfusion unit
price were obtained from the accounting system of the
Edouard Herriot Hospital; prices for ESA injections given
outside hospitalization were calculated according to the
national social insurance price. Total costs of ESA and
RBC transfusions in the studied groups were compared to
RBC transfusion costs in the matched populations.
Statistical Analysis

The main aim of this study was to determine the patient’s
QoL at inclusion, and month 3 and month 6 after inclusion. The scores were calculated only if responses for more
than 80% of the items were obtained. The evolution of
the scores was analyzed with the nonparametric paired test
of Friedman, and the comparison between each score was
analyzed with a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test.
Secondary analyses were carried out using t tests to
compare Hb levels and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test for
transfusions number between studied groups and the
matched population. OS and EFS were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test for univariate
analysis. The multivariate analysis studied the following
variables: for group 1, age, sex, cytogenetics, type of chemotherapy (intensive vs standard), disease status, and baseline Hb levels; for group 2, age, sex, cytogenetics, type of
disease, interval diagnosis-transplantation, disease status,

Original Article

Twelve patients (11%) were withdrawn (4 in group 1 and
8 in group 2) due to ESA inefficacy. In group 1, the median time to achieve an ESA CR was 34 days (range, 1767 days) after first consolidation chemotherapy and 41
days (range, 12-67 days) after second consolidation (P ¼
.35) with a median number of ESA injections of 5 (range,
2-9) and 6 (range, 2-9), respectively. In group 2, the median time to achieve ESA CR was 39 days (range, 14-180
days) after a median number of 6 (range, 2-9) injections.
When compared between ESA patients and controls for
the 2 groups, mean Hb level was not statistically different
at baseline (11.3 g/dL  19 vs 10.8 g/L  19, respectively;
P ¼ .19), whereas ESA patients had significantly higher
Hb level at hospital discharge (10.4 g/dL  1.6 vs 9.3 g/
dL  7, respectively; P ¼ .0001) and at the 6-month visit
(11.2 g/dL  2.0 vs 10.3 g/dL  16, respectively; P ¼
.012).

according to FACT-An subscale (P ¼ .001) and to the
FACT-F subscale (P ¼ .003) (Fig. 1) were observed.
According to Total FACT-An and to FACT-G, the QoL
remained stable during the 6-month follow-up period.
However, a statistically significant increase (P ¼ .04) was
observed in the physical well-being.
ESA Response

The median number of ESA injections per patient was 13
(range, 3-24) in group 1 and 8 injections (range, 2-28) in
group 2. There were 85 ESA CR (43 [83%] in group 1
and 42 [71%] in group 2) and 3 (6%) ESA PR (only in
group 1). Among patients who reached the 6-month follow-up in the 2 groups, 85% had a normal Hb level.
110

Among evaluable patients, those under ESA exhibited a
significantly lower RBC transfusion rate compared to
controls. In group 1, there were 319 RBC units used in
the ESA group, whereas 487 RBC units were recorded in
the control group, which represents a median reduction of
3.9 RBC units per patient (P ¼ .0002). In group 2, there
were 227 RBC units used in the ESA group, whereas 355
RBC units were recorded in the control group, which represents a median reduction of 3.2 RBC units per patient
(P ¼ .04). In terms of platelet transfusions, we noted a significantly lower number of transfusions in ESA patients
only in group 1 compared to controls (322 units vs 396
units, P ¼ .029), which represents a median reduction of
1.7 platelet units per patient. No significant difference
was found between those receiving ESAs and controls in
group 2.
Safety

The ESA injections were well-tolerated in both groups.
Adverse events possibly related to ESA were 4 in group 1
(2 thrombotic events, 1 arthralgia, and 1 cutaneous
allergy) and 5 in group 2 (all events were thrombovascular). One ESA-related serious adverse event was reported
in group 2: hospitalization (11 days) due to a deep vein
thrombosis of lower limbs. Furthermore, incidence of
thromboembolic events in the ESA population and in the
matched population were statistically similar (group 1:
3.6% vs 3.2%, P ¼ .88; group 2: 9.8% vs 3.3%, P ¼ .34).
Cost Evaluation

The economic study showed that the median costs of ESA
injections in group 1 were €3904 per patient (range, €2732€6058) and €1862 per patient (range, €955-€3104)
Cancer

in group 2. These costs included ESA injections administered inside and outside hospitalization; median ESA inside
hospital costs were €1596 per patient (range, €976-€2328)
and 5€518 per patient (range, €339-€907) in group 1 and
2, respectively; median ESA outside hospitalization
costs were €2219 per patient (range, €1281-€3500) and
€307 per patient (range, €0-€1832) in group 1 and 2,
respectively.
When we compared the RBC transfusion-related
costs between patients who received ESAs and their controls, there was a significantly lower cost in the ESA
groups. For group 1: €2568 per patient (range, € 1712€4280) for ESA patients vs €4280 per patient (range,
€2568-€5992) for controls (P ¼ .007); for group 2: €856
per patient (range, €761-€3424) for ESA patients vs
€2568 per patient (range, €856-€5041) for controls (P ¼
.04). Therefore, a RBC transfusion-related median reduction of €1712 per patient was estimated in each group.
Multivariate Analysis

The multivariate analysis studying different confounding
factors on the cumulative incidence of ESA CR showed a
significant positive impact of younger age (P ¼ .001) and
intensive chemotherapy (P ¼ .03) in group 1, and the
negative impact of female recipient (P ¼ .036) and major
ABO incompatibility (P ¼ .018) for group 2.
Overall and Event-Free Survival

After a median follow-up of 22.5 months (range, 6-49
months) for patients in group 1 and 25.9 months (range,
6-107 months) for their controls, we did not find any significant difference either in terms of OS (P ¼ .77) or in
terms of EFS (P ¼ .57) (Fig. 2A,B). Similarly, after a median follow-up of 12.6 months (range, 2-45 months) for
patients in group 2 and 22 months (range, 1-145 months)
for their controls, there was also no significant difference
either in terms of OS (P ¼ .69) or in terms of EFS (P ¼
.79) (Fig. 2C,D).
DISCUSSION
Despite the recent ASH and ASCO recommendations for
the use of ESAs in treatment of different oncology and hematology diseases,16 there is a lack of guidelines for its use
in patients with myeloid malignancies and in patients
undergoing allo-HSCT. In order to avoid any conflict of
interest toward the use of a specific type of ESA, in our
study, we decided to use the 2 available ESA molecules at
that time: darbepoetin alfa and epoetin beta. There are no
available powerful studies concerning the use of ESAs in
myeloid malignancies and in patients undergoing alloHSCT, and the studies that were present reported heteroCancer

geneous populations and small number of patients. In
terms of Hb response, we observed ESA CR in 83% of
patients (Hb level  12 g/dL) in group 1 and ESA CR in
71% of patients in group 2 with only 11% in total of ESA
inefficiency in the 2 groups. In group 1, the median time
to achieve an ESA CR was 34 days after first consolidation
chemotherapy and 41 days after second consolidation. In
group 2, the median time to achieve ESA CR was 39 days.
When compared between ESA patients and controls, ESA
patients had significantly higher Hb level at hospital discharge. Our results confirm previous results from studies
evaluating the ESA response on Hb level in patients with
solid tumors or with lymphoproliferative disorders and in
patients undergoing chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT
showing a clear significant improvement in Hb level.33–36
Transfusion avoidance is generally the rationale for
ESA administration in patients with cancer. The use of
ESAs when Hb level is between 10 and 12 g/dL has been
considered on the basis of the hypothesis that it may
improve QoL in patients with cancer. Several clinical trials37–39 and one meta-analysis40 have included QoL as
an endpoint for patients with chemotherapy-induced
anemia randomly assigned to treatment with ESAs or
placebo; these studies show that the use of ESAs has led
to a statistically significant increase in QoL. Nevertheless, patients with AML or who were undergoing alloHSCT were underreported in these studies. In our study,
there was an improvement of QoL at 1, 2, 3, and 6
months follow-up with a significant positive effect at 6
months according to the FACT-An subscale (P ¼ .001)
and to the FACT-F subscale (P ¼ .003). This improvement can appear with the natural history of the disease
either for AML patients or those undergoing alloHSCT, but anemia frequently persists during this follow-up with an important impact on patient performance status if no ESAs were given. According to the
recent ASH/ASCO guidelines on the use of ESAs,16
assessment of QoL remains challenging.
Concerns regarding a potential relationship between
ESAs and increased risk of mortality rate have been raised
in many clinical trials, with controversial results.25–29 A
study by Aapro et al evaluated the impact of treatment
with epoetin-beta on survival in patients with cancer by
pooling results of 12 randomized controlled studies.41
They did not find any significant effect on mortality and
disease progression after use of ESAs compared with the
control group. On the other hand, Bohlius et al evaluated
the survival in different patient populations from 53
randomized studies,30 and they concluded that use of
ESAs significantly increases the on-study mortality rate in

rate increase was observed in patients receiving chemotherapy and ESAs. In this meta-analysis, the authors noted
evidence for interaction between ESA administration, Hb
levels at baseline, target Hb level and mortality. In addition, when results were limited to patients with hematological malignancies, the mortality rate was not
significantly affected by ESAs use; the authors also

pointed out that one study27 (in breast cancers) has contributed 20% weight to the overall meta-analysis, and its
exclusion reduced the overall hazard ratio. In our study,
we did not find any significant difference between ESA
patients in group 1 and their controls, either in terms of
OS or in terms of EFS. Similarly, for patients in group 2
and their controls, there was no significant difference either in terms of OS or in terms of EFS.

ESA Use in AML and Allogeneic HSCT Patients/Michallet et al

When analyzing the number of RBC transfusions
between ESA patients and controls, we noticed a significant benefit of ESA use leading to a median reduction of
3.9 RBC units per patient in group 1 (35% reduction)
and 3.2 RBC units per patient in group 2 (36% reduction). Similarly, a meta-analysis by Lyman et al showed
approximately 50% reductions of RBC transfusions when
ESAs were introduced.42 In 2006, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality published a comparative effectiveness review of ESAs.43 They found that the majority
of trials reported fewer transfusions among patients randomly assigned to ESA treatment compared with patients
assigned to controls.
Many studies have warned about the thromboembolic events related to the use of ESAs,31,40,44 whereas
other trials showed similar events between ESA patients
and controls.45 In our study, thrombovascular events were
not statistically different between groups 1 and 2 and their
controls.
Finally, we have shown significantly fewer transfusions in the 2 groups, a reduction associated with an economic benefit of €1712 per patient. This economic
benefit has to be added to the important QoL improvement and decrease of RBC transfusions with their side
effects.
In conclusion, this prospective study shows a clinical and economic benefit of ESA administration, an
achievement of a normal Hb level, and a significant
reduction of number of RBC transfusions as well as toxicity related to RBC transfusions. ESA administration
could improve a patient’s QoL with no harmful effect on
survival.
