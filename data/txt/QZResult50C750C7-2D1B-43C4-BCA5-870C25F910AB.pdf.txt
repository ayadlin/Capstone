ABSTRACT
Post-transcriptional regulation is a powerful mediator of gene expression, and
can rapidly alter the expression of numerous transcripts involved in tumorigenesis.
We have previously shown that the mRNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) is elevated
in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) specimens compared to normal
pancreatic tissues, and its cytoplasmic localization is associated with increased
tumor stage. To gain a better insight into HuR’s role in PDA biology and to assess
it as a candidate therapeutic target, we altered HuR expression in PDA cell lines
and characterized the resulting phenotype in preclinical models. HuR silencing by
short hairpin and small interfering RNAs significantly decreased cell proliferation
and anchorage-independent growth, as well as impaired migration and invasion.
In comparison, HuR overexpression increased migration and invasion, but had
no significant effects on cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth.
Importantly, two distinct targeted approaches to HuR silencing showed marked
impairment in tumor growth in mouse xenografts. NanoString nCounter® analyses
demonstrated that HuR regulates core biological processes, highlighting that HuR
inhibition likely thwarts PDA viability through post-transcriptional regulation of
diverse signaling pathways (e.g. cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair). Taken together,
our study suggests that targeted inhibition of HuR may be a novel, promising approach
to the treatment of PDA.

genetic alterations (e.g. KRAS, p16/CDKN2A, TP53) and
dysregulated signaling pathways involved in pancreatic
tumorigenesis [2–5]. In fact, since the introduction in 1997
of gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine) monotherapy
as the standard of care for metastatic PDA, the only new
treatment regimens to show superior efficacy (gemcitabine
+ erlotinib, gemcitabine + Abraxane, and FOLFIRINOX)
have improved overall survival in the metastatic setting
by only 0.4–4.3 months [2, 6]. New approaches in the
treatment of this deadly disease are urgently needed [7].
Genetic mutations and copy number changes can
dramatically influence gene expression, but they emerge
in cancer cells over many years of biologic selection [8].
Molecular pathway changes at the RNA level represent a
separate, but understudied, aspect of cancer biology that
is especially relevant for adaptive cellular reprogramming
to acute stress [9]. RNA expression changes are rapid,
efficient, and reversible [9–11]. Broadly speaking, these
changes may be classified as transcriptional and impact
the quantity of RNA made by a cancer cell, or posttranscriptional and affect other aspects of RNA regulation
(e.g. stability, translation). Post-transcriptional regulation
is predominantly mediated by trans-acting microRNAs
(miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), many of
which have become implicated in cancer progression
[12–15]. While miRNAs have received greater attention
in recent years, RBPs may be even more important for the
tumorigenesis process [16–18]. RBPs are more stable and
require a greater investment of cell energy for synthesis;
moreover, roughly 5% of all genes are believed to encode
RBPs [19].
Human antigen R (HuR, encoded by the ELAVL1
gene) is a ubiquitously expressed RBP whose role in
cancer has become increasingly evident in recent years
[20]. HuR is primarily localized to the nucleus, where it is
involved in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, but
can shuttle to the cytoplasm where it regulates the stability
and/or translation of bound mRNA transcripts [21].
HuR targets have characteristic AU-rich RNA elements
(AREs), which are typically located in the 3′ untranslated
region (3′ UTR). Many of these transcripts are involved
in key cellular processes such as proliferation, survival,
angiogenesis, immune response, and metastasis, enabling
HuR to influence multiple critical survival mechanisms
[20–22].
No somatic ELAVL1 mutations, copy number
changes, or epigenetic alterations in any human cancer
have been reported to date [23, 24]. Yet clinically, we and
others have demonstrated that total and/or cytoplasmic
HuR expression is elevated in numerous tissue-specific
cancers, compared to normal cells [23, 25–30]. In
general, elevated HuR expression and/or localization
in the cytoplasm (where HuR carries out the majority
of its mRNA-regulating functions) are associated with
poor clinicopathologic features, suggesting that HuR is
a potent promoter of tumorigenesis or aggressive cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

biology [23, 25–29, 31–52]. Specifically in PDA, we have
shown that HuR expression (both total and cytoplasmic) is
elevated compared to normal pancreatic tissues, and that
cytoplasmic HuR expression positively correlates with
tumor (T) stage [25, 30]. We have also demonstrated using
in vitro models that HuR protects PDA cells from stressors
that are relevant to the tumor microenvironment, such as
glucose withdrawal, hypoxia, and DNA damage (Blanco
et al., unpublished) [53, 54]. These stressors act as stimuli
to translocate HuR to the cytoplasm, wherein it stabilizes
and promotes the translation of target mRNA transcripts
(e.g. mediators of glucose metabolism, the hypoxiainducible proto-oncogene PIM1, the mitotic kinase
inhibitor WEE1) in a manner that promotes cell survival.
The differential expression of HuR between
neoplastic and normal tissues (i.e. a more available target
in cancer cells vs. normal cells), combined with HuR’s
induction of numerous pro-tumorigenic transcripts over
multiple defined PDA core signaling pathways, supports
the hypothesis that HuR is a promising, novel therapeutic
target in PDA [3, 20]. In fact, several publications have
explored the effect of modulating HuR expression in
various tissue-specific cancers (e.g. breast, colorectal,
brain) [23, 55–57]. In the majority of cases, overexpression
of HuR enhances tumor proliferation, whereas silencing of
HuR reduces tumor proliferation. Therefore, we launched
into a line of investigation utilizing preclinical models
to test the hypothesis that HuR drives aggressive PDA
biology, and may be targeted as a novel treatment strategy
for PDA.

RESULTS
Characterization of doxycycline
(DOX)-inducible MIA PaCa-2 cell lines
In order to study the effect of HuR expression
on PDA phenotype, we generated DOX-inducible
MIA PaCa-2 cell lines. Two cell lines generated by
lentiviral transduction express distinct short hairpin
RNAs (shRNAs) that target HuR mRNA, in response to
DOX treatment (hereafter referred to as Mia.sh290 and
Mia.sh700, based on the locations of targeted sequences).
In DOX-treated Mia.sh290 and Mia.sh700 cells, we
observed significant knockdown of HuR at both mRNA
and protein levels. The mRNA knockdown in response
to DOX was 59% and 48% in Mia.sh290 and Mia.sh700,
respectively (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). The protein knockdown
reached a maximum of 50–60% in both cell lines at 5 days
of DOX treatment, and was sustained thereafter (Figs.
1B and S1). HuR expression in a control cell line, stably
transduced with empty vector lentivirus (hereafter referred
to as Mia.CTRL), was unaffected by DOX treatment.
Another cell line (hereafter referred to as Mia.HuR)
was generated by stable transfection with a tetracyclineresponsive plasmid, and overexpressed HuR in response

(Fig.  S2). Surprisingly, HuR overexpression had no
apparent effect on cell proliferation, in both the DOXtreated Mia.HuR cells and PL5 cells transiently transfected
with HuR overexpression plasmid (Figs. 2 and S2).

HuR is required for short-term proliferation
of PDA cells

HuR is required for anchorage-independent
growth of PDA cells

We first studied the effect of manipulating HuR
expression on cell proliferation. DOX treatment caused
a significant decrease in the proliferation of Mia.sh290
and Mia.sh700 cells over a 10-day period, as assessed by
PicoGreen staining of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
content (Fig. 2). The decrease did not become apparent
until 5–6 days of treatment, likely due to the fact that
DOX-induced HuR silencing is gradual and does not
reach maximal protein-level knockdown until 4–5 days
of treatment (Fig. S1). To confirm that the effect of HuR
manipulation was not cell line-specific, we performed
transient transfections in an additional PDA cell line (PL5).
In contrast to the gradual effect of DOX treatment in Mia.

by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection resulted

There was a possibility that the full effect of
manipulating HuR expression on PDA proliferation
could not be appreciated in the short timescale of the
above experiment. As such, we performed soft agar
colony formation assays with the DOX-inducible MIA
PaCa-2 cell lines to gauge anchorage-independent growth
over a 4 week period (Fig. 3). Cells were seeded in soft
agar, and cultured in the presence or absence of DOX
for 4 weeks. In the Mia.sh290 and Mia.sh700 cell lines,
DOX-induced HuR silencing resulted in 57% and 71%
decrease in colony number, compared to the untreated
condition (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). As with
the short-term proliferation assay, DOX treatment had
no effect on colony formation for the Mia.CTRL, Mia.
EV, and Mia.HuR cell lines. Taken together, these results

levels do not enhance cell proliferation.

in migration with HuR silencing, and an increase in
migration with HuR overexpression (p < 0.01 for both).
In Matrigel invasion assays, HuR silencing reduced
invasion by 59% (p < 0.01), and HuR overexpression
increased invasion 1.7-fold (p < 0.05). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that both increases and decreases
in HuR expression affect the invasive phenotype of PDA
cells. This is in contrast to cell proliferation, where HuR
overexpression had no effect.

HuR facilitates PDA invasiveness
We next investigated the importance of HuR
expression on the invasive phenotype of PDA using two
different assays. In vitro scratch assays with Mia.sh290
and Mia.sh700 cells pre-treated with 0 or 2 μg/ml DOX
showed a significant decrease in migration rate under
HuR-silenced conditions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). As expected,
Mia.CTRL and Mia.EV cells were not significantly
affected by DOX treatment. Whereas it did not affect
proliferation of PDA cells, HuR overexpression by DOX
treatment of Mia.HuR cells significantly increased the
migration rate (p < 0.05).
To complement the in vitro scratch assays, we
performed Matrigel invasion assays, which showed the
same trends (Fig. 5). Cells in serum-free medium were
seeded on transwell inserts coated with Matrigel, and
incubated for 24 hours with serum-rich medium in the
bottom chambers serving as chemoattractant to promote
invasion. In response to DOX-induced HuR silencing,
invasion through Matrigel was significantly decreased in
Mia.sh290 and Mia.sh700 cells (41% decrease and 56%
decrease, respectively, p < 0.05). Invasion was increased
with DOX-induced HuR overexpression in Mia.HuR
cells (13.5-fold increase, p < 0.05), and unchanged in the
control cell lines (Mia.CTRL and Mia.EV).
The results of both assays were reproduced in PL5
cells with transient knockdown or overexpression of
HuR (Fig. S3). In vitro scratch assays showed a decrease

Lipidoid-delivered HuR siRNA suppresses
established PDA xenograft growth
To test whether or not inhibition of HuR is a
viable strategy to inhibit PDA growth in vivo, we
performed a pilot experiment utilizing nude female mice
subcutaneously injected in their hind flanks with MIA
PaCa-2. At ~4 weeks post-injection, baseline tumor
volumes were determined, and mice were randomly
assigned to 3 groups for treatment with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) vehicle, firefly luciferase siRNA (siLuc), or
HuR siRNA (siHuR). For intratumoral injection, siLuc
and siHuR were encapsulated in the lipidoid nanoparticle
98N12-5, which has been previously shown to effectively
deliver claudin-3 siRNA in an ovarian cancer xenograft
model [58]. Mice were treated twice per week for 2 weeks,
and tumor volumes were measured at the indicated time
points (Fig. 6A). By day 8 of treatment, tumors in the
siHuR treatment group were significantly smaller than
tumors in either the PBS or siLuc treatment groups
(p < 0.05). At the end of the pilot experiment (day 17),
tumors in the siHuR group were 2-fold smaller than
tumors in the PBS (p < 0.05) or siLuc (p < 0.01) groups

were  TGFB1 (2.46-fold), L1CAM (2.31-fold), MMP1
(1.83-fold), FGFR3 (1.77-fold), and PTK7 (1.75-fold).
The 5 downregulated transcripts with the greatest fold
change were CDK4 (0.56-fold), EPS8 (0.59-fold), NRAS
(0.61-fold), BRCA2 (0.62-fold), and CHEK1 (0.63-fold).
These transcripts encompassed those that are regulated by
HuR directly (i.e. HuR binds to the transcripts and directly
regulates their stability and/or translation), as well as
indirectly (i.e. HuR does not bind to the transcripts, but
their expression is altered as a downstream effect of HuR’s
direct regulation of other targets).
In order to distinguish the direct and indirect targets
of HuR, we performed messenger ribonucleoproteinimmunoprecipitation (mRNP-IP) in MIA PaCa-2 cells to
isolate mRNA transcripts that were directly bound to HuR
(2 biological replicates). For comparison, mRNP-IP with
isotype control immunoglobulin G (IgG) was performed
(2 biological replicates). Fig. S6 shows the western blot and
qPCR performed as quality control steps to validate that the
mRNP-IP was specific and successful. The input samples
(cytoplasmic lysates) were all positive for HuR protein and
alpha-tubulin protein, the HuR IP samples were positive for
HuR protein but not alpha-tubulin protein, and the control
IgG IP samples were negative for both HuR protein and
alpha-tubulin protein. qPCR showed that compared to
RNAs isolated from control IgG mRNP-IP samples, RNAs
isolated from HuR mRNP-IP samples were significantly
enriched in the transcript of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK),
which has been previously demonstrated by our group
to be a direct binding target of HuR protein [30]. When
gene expression analysis for these mRNP-IP RNA samples
was performed using the nCounter® GX Human Cancer
Reference Kit, we were able to identify 35 transcripts (out
of 236, or 15%) that were enriched in the HuR mRNPIP RNA samples compared to the IgG mRNP-IP RNA
samples (i.e.  direct targets of HuR) (Table S2). The 5
most enriched transcripts were SFPQ (1,289-fold), BIRC5
(1,273-fold), TP53 (1,069-fold), CTNNB1 (788-fold), and
CD44 (758-fold). By cross-referencing these 35 transcripts
with the 87 aforementioned transcripts, we were able to
identify a total of 17 transcripts that were both direct targets
of HuR, and differentially expressed upon HuR silencing
(9 upregulated and 8 downregulated transcripts in siHuR
vs. siCTRL) (Table 1). Notably, 31 out of the 35 direct
targets of HuR were previously independently validated,
wherein various high-throughput targeting technologies
(e.g.
photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation or PAR-CLIP)
identified the HuR “target-ome” in a modified human
embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line [60].
Functional annotation enrichment analysis using
the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID) revealed the biological processes
that were significantly enriched based on the list of HuRregulated transcripts (Table S3). Among the 43 genes
upregulated with HuR knockdown, the top enriched

In the Mia.sh290 xenografts, mRNA expression
analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated
significant reduction of HuR mRNA in the DOX diet group
(65% decrease compared to normal diet group, p < 0.0001)
(Fig. 7D). Notably, we observed a significant correlation
between tumor volume and HuR mRNA expression. That
is, the largest tumors tended to have the highest HuR
expression, whereas the smallest tumors tended to have
the lowest HuR expression (Spearman rho = 0.5624,
confidence interval 0.1149–0.8202, p < 0.05). Western
blotting of tumor lysates validated HuR knockdown at the
protein level (54% decrease in DOX diet group vs. normal
diet group, p < 0.05) (Fig. 7E). Taken together, the two
distinct xenograft models of HuR inhibition demonstrate
that targeted inhibition of HuR may be a viable therapeutic
strategy against PDA.

HuR regulates multiple cancer-related pathways
In order to better understand the mechanism
by which HuR inhibition affects PDA phenotype in
preclinical models, we performed gene expression
analyses using the nCounter® GX Human Cancer
Reference Kit (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA),
which allows for high-sensitivity and high-precision
profiling of 230 genes (plus 6 housekeeping genes) known
to be differentially expressed in various human cancers
(see Table S1 for the full list of genes in the panel) [59].
Two separate experiments were performed. In the first
experiment, MIA PaCa-2 cells were transiently transfected
with control siRNA (siCTRL) or HuR siRNA (siHuR)
for 72 hours, and total RNA samples were isolated and
analyzed (4 biological replicates each). Multivariate
statistical analysis of the filtered and normalized dataset
(containing 157 genes) revealed that the replicates for the
siHuR group were clearly separated from the replicates
for the siCTRL group (Figs. 8 and S5 and Table 1). In
more detail, the principal component analysis (PCA)
graph is a two-dimensional representation with each
sample being projected on each axis based on its transcript
profile (Fig.  8A). The fact that the siHuR samples are
separated from the siCTRL samples indicates that the
analyzed transcript profile changes significantly after
HuR knockdown. In the case of hierarchical clustering
(HCL) analysis, the dendrogram shows how well samples,
or clusters of samples, are correlated with each other
(Fig.  8B). As shown, the siHuR and siCTRL groups
arranged in two distinct clusters, supporting the results
of our PCA analysis. Finally, significance analysis of
microarrays (SAM) was used to identify transcripts with
significantly different expression after HuR knockdown,
and found 87 such transcripts (out of 157, or 55%) (Fig. S5
and Table 1). In the siHuR samples, 43 transcripts (27%)
were significantly upregulated, and 44 transcripts (28%)
were significantly downregulated, compared to siCTRL.

Least Significant

Full list of transcripts that were upregulated (left) or downregulated (right) in MIA PaCa-2 cells transfected for 72 hours
with HuR siRNA, compared to cells transfected with control siRNA, with the associated fold changes. All fold changes are
significant (p < 0.05), with the list of transcripts in each column sorted in the order of significance (most significant at the top;
least significant at the bottom). Gray cells indicate transcripts that were identified as direct HuR targets (i.e. transcripts that
were significantly enriched in HuR mRNP-IP samples compared to control IgG mRNP-IP samples, as described in Table S2).
False discovery rate (FDR) = 0% for all transcripts.
biological processes were related to transcriptional
regulation, nucleotide synthesis, and nucleotide
metabolism. Among the 44 genes downregulated with
HuR knockdown, the top enriched biological processes
were related to cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA repair,
and apoptosis. Among the 35 genes whose transcripts
are directly bound by HuR, the top enriched biological
processes were related to cell cycle, cell proliferation,
and apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that
therapeutic targeting of HuR can affect multiple essential
biological processes at once, by disrupting HuR’s
regulation of numerous cancer-related transcripts.

In the present study, we demonstrated that
silencing HuR expression significantly inhibits PDA
proliferation in vitro (Figs. 2, 3, and S2) and in vivo
(Figs. 6 and 7). However, in contrast to the majority of
published results, HuR overexpression did not enhance
PDA proliferation in our cell culture models (Figs. 2, 3,
and S2). We speculate that in PDA, HuR’s contribution
to proliferative potential is maximal (i.e. saturated) at
baseline expression levels. In fact, too much expression/
activity of HuR has been shown to have detrimental
effects on cancer cells. For example, Gubin et al.
demonstrated that exogenous HuR overexpression in
the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell
line enhanced cell proliferation in vitro, but dramatically
impaired tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopic
xenograft model [57]. Moreover, although HuR is
normally a promoter of cell survival, exposure of cells
to lethal stress (in which cell death is unavoidable) has
been shown to irreversibly convert HuR into a promoter
of apoptosis [63]. These observations support the notion
that HuR’s effect on the cancer phenotype is most likely
both tissue- and context-dependent. In comparison
to HuR’s effect on cell proliferation, both HuR
overexpression and silencing affected PDA invasiveness
in in vitro experiments (Figs. 4, 5, and S3).
Even though our findings support a strong role for
HuR in PDA tumorigenesis, the presented data should be
interpreted in the context of the preclinical models used
in this study. For instance, the proof-of-principle studies
described herein were performed in a limited number of
immortalized, established PDA cell lines. Commercial

DISCUSSION
Despite the discovery of multiple genomic
alterations that give rise to PDA, attempts to exploit these
lesions (e.g. oncogenic RAS activation) for either early
detection or treatment have so far been unsuccessful in
the clinical setting [2–5, 7, 61]. In order to change the
paradigm of PDA management for the better, novel
strategies that venture outside of the traditional “genecentric” approach may be necessary. This perspective
prompted us to investigate a relatively understudied,
but highly relevant, aspect of cancer biology – posttranscriptional regulation by RBPs. While others have
studied the RBP HuR in the context of other cancer
types, we are the first to study this regulatory protein in
preclinical models of PDA. The findings from this study
complement previous studies by our group that cast HuR
as an intriguing therapeutic target in PDA [25, 53, 54, 62].

cell lines perform robustly under many experimental
conditions and exhibit hallmark molecular aspects of PDA
(e.g. KRAS and TP53 mutations), thereby functioning as
convenient model systems; yet, their generalizability to
primary and metastatic PDAs in patients is difficult to
determine [64, 65]. To that end, we are in the process
of establishing conditionally-reprogrammed cells and
organoids derived from PDA patient samples, which
should serve as complementary alternatives to established
cell lines [66, 67].
Additionally, subcutaneous heterotopic xenografts
have limitations as an in vivo model for PDA [68]. Tumor
metastases cannot be properly studied with subcutaneous
xenografts, and the hallmark desmoplastic reaction
observed in most human PDAs do not develop in this
preclinical model [2, 4, 68–70]. Thus, we are currently
in the long-term process of utilizing an established
genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of
PDA – KrasLSL-G12D/+; Trp53LSL-R172H/+; Cre (KPC) – as
a background to manipulate pancreas-specific HuR
expression (Sawicki et al., unpublished) [71]. In the
present study, HuR overexpression did not affect the
growth of established PDA in vitro, in the context of an
HuR network that is already highly engaged in PDA cell
lines (Figs. 2, 3, and S2). However, we hypothesize that
HuR overexpression may cooperate with KRAS and TP53
mutations to promote pathogenesis from normal cells
(where HuR activity is typically minimal at baseline) to
pre-cancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)
and eventually PDA. Conversely, we hypothesize that
crossing a pancreas-specific HuR deletion GEMM with
KPC GEMM will dramatically retard or even eliminate
pancreatic tumorigenesis. With the proper controls, these
GEMMs will provide an ideal setting to study HuR
within the context of an intact immune system and a more
relevant tumor microenvironment. In particular, these
GEMMs will enable studies into HuR’s role in every stage
of tumor development – from the early stages of tumor
initiation to the late stages of metastatic invasion.
Consistent with previous mechanistic studies, we
have demonstrated here that HuR directly and indirectly
regulates numerous cancer-related transcripts (Fig. 8
and Table 1). These transcripts play critical roles in
multiple essential biological processes related to cell
cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, and nucleotide metabolism,
among others, and emphasize the notion that therapeutic
inhibition of HuR alone can simultaneously affect all of
these pathways. In fact, previous studies revealed that
HuR regulates clusters of genes, referred to as regulons,
in order to efficiently affect whole pathways [72]. In
light of HuR’s broad influence over diverse critical prosurvival pathways, HuR inhibition provides a unique
therapeutic opportunity observed with just a handful of
master regulators of cancer biology (e.g. MYC) [73]. In
conventional targeted therapeutic strategies, only one
gene or one pathway is typically affected at a time. Cancer

cells rely on intrinsic redundancy in cellular signaling,
and invoke any number of chemoresistance mechanisms
to overcome therapies that fit under the umbrella of
“precision medicine” [74]. In contrast, HuR inhibition
offers a new global synthetic lethal approach, in which
multiple core signaling pathways are targeted at once,
leaving the cancer cells with no viable compensatory
mechanisms.
To date, the best-characterized small molecule
inhibitor of HuR is the chrysanthone-like compound
MS-444 [75]. Despite its success as a lead compound
in preclinical models, issues with its stability
and bioavailability in vivo may hinder its clinical
utility (Blanco et al., unpublished). As such, we have begun
to explore several alternative strategies for HuR inhibition.
In the present study, we were able to demonstrate
effective HuR knockdown and reduction of tumor growth
utilizing HuR siRNA intratumorally delivered by lipidoid
nanoparticles (Fig. 6). However, a clinically relevant
therapy for PDA must have systemic activity in order
to treat microscopic and macroscopic metastases, which
typically drive the clinical course of the disease in patients
[76]. Studies that involve systemic therapeutic strategies
to inhibit HuR will need to address toxicity and define a
therapeutic window. It has been previously reported that
postnatal global deletion of HuR in mice has no apparent
effect on quiescent stem cells and differentiated cells
[77]. However, rapidly proliferating progenitor cells
in the thymus, bone marrow, and intestine underwent
apoptosis, and the mice eventually died due to atrophy of
hematopoietic organs and obstructive enterocolitis. This
suggests that any HuR inhibitor that acts systemically
may very well, at minimum, be accompanied by toxicities
similar to those seen with conventional chemotherapeutics
(e.g. nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, immunosuppression). In
order to minimize potential systemic toxicities, we are
currently developing a systemic siRNA-based strategy that
utilizes a DNA scaffold, which may be functionalized with
targeting moieties that preferentially direct the siRNA to
PDA cells.
Although a therapeutic window of opportunity may
be realized with generalized HuR inhibition due to the fact
that its regulatory targets are commonly active in cancerassociated survival pathways (as compared to normal
cells), we believe that inhibiting HuR’s most critical
binding interactions may very well improve specificity
without compromising therapeutic efficacy. This may be
theoretically accomplished by precisely disrupting the
interaction between HuR and the specific AREs present on
selected target transcripts. This approach should mitigate
the disruption of HuR’s regulation of house-keeping
transcripts (which contain different AREs) that are
essential for normal biological processes. Specifically, we
have begun to develop decoy RNA oligonucleotides that
contain sequence motifs complementary to the 3′ UTRs
of cancer-specific HuR binding targets (e.g. WEE1) [54].
27324

Oncotarget

These “suicide UTRs,” or “sUTRs,” can theoretically
compete with HuR for these regulatory binding sites
(essentially acting as RNA sponges), and thereby
antagonize HuR-directed pro-survival pathways.
To summarize, we provide proof-of-principle
evidence that targeted HuR inhibition impairs the
malignant phenotype of PDA cells in both in vitro and
in vivo preclinical models. Subsequent translational
studies, utilizing more clinically relevant model systems,
will further determine the utility of targeting HuR to treat
PDA as well as other cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

according to manufacturer’s instructions to generate
MIA PaCa-2 cells stably transfected with pCMV-Tet3G
plasmid (Mia.pCMV-Tet3G). HuR complementary
DNA (cDNA) was cloned into pTRE3G-mCherry
plasmid using In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus (Clontech
Laboratories, cat. #638909). Mia.pCMV-Tet3G cells
were then stably transfected with either empty vector
(pTRE3G-mCherry) or HuR overexpression vector
(pTRE3G-mCherry-HuR) to generate Mia.EV and Mia.
HuR cell lines, respectively.
For DOX induction, cells were treated with
2  μg/ml DOX hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #D9891)
for the indicated times.

routinely passaged and cultured at 37°C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2.

For transient HuR overexpression studies, the
coding region of the human ELAVL1 gene was subcloned
from pCMV6-XL5 ELAVL1 plasmid (OriGene, cat.
#SC119271) into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) plasmid (Life
Technologies, cat. #V860–20), and transfected into
PDA cells. Transfection with empty vector served
as control. Transient HuR knockdown studies were
performed by transfecting cells with a custom-made
HuR siRNA oligonucleotide (GE Dharmacon; sense
5′-CCAUUAAGGUGUCGUAUGCUCUU-3′, antisense
5′-UUGAGCAUACGACACCUUAAUGG-3′).
Transfection with ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting

Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression analysis

To generate short hairpin RNA (shRNA)expressing plasmids, shRNA-encoding oligonucleotides
targeting HuR (referred to as sh290 and sh700) were
cloned into the Tet-pLKO-puro lentiviral plasmid
(Addgene, cat. #21915) as previously described [78].
The targeted sequences were as follows: sh290  =
sense
5′-GCAGCAUUGGUGAAGUUGAAUCU-3′,
antisense 5′-AGAUUCAACUUCACCAAUGCUGC-3′;
sh700 = sense 5′-GCCCAUCACAGUGAAGUUUGCA-3′,
antisense 5′-UGCAAACUUCACUGUGAUGGGC-3′.
Lentiviruses were generated and transduced into MIA
PaCa-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1, and
selection was performed with 1 μg/ml puromycin
dihydrochloride (Life Technologies, cat. #A11138-03) to
isolate clones of Mia.CTRL (transduced with empty vector
lentivirus), Mia.sh290, and Mia.sh700.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent
(Life Technologies, cat. #15596) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized
from 1 μg of total RNA using random primers and
MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies,
cat. #4368813). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis
was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies,
cat. #4351107) and SYBR Select Master Mix
(Life Technologies, cat. #4472908). HuR mRNA
expression was detected with the following primer
set:
sense
5′-GCTCGGTCTACTCAGGCATC-3′,
antisense
5′-CCAGTCCAGGAGCCTAATGA-3′.
18S rRNA expression was used for normalization,
and was detected with the following primer set: sense

Soft agar colony formation assay

For total protein extraction, cell pellets were
resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1X protease
inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
and 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. #sc-24948). Samples
were placed on ice for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at
16,000 × g, at 4°C, for 30 minutes. The supernatants
were recovered, and protein concentrations were
determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life
Technologies, cat. #23225). The protein samples were
mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95°C for
10 minutes, then size-fractionated on homemade 10%
polyacrylamide gels. The samples were then transferred
to Immun-Blot low fluorescence PVDF membranes
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, cat. #162–0264) for 2 hours at
4°C. The membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room
temperature using Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR
Biosciences, cat. #927–40000), then probed overnight
at 4°C with mouse monoclonal antibodies against HuR
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. #sc-5261), alphatubulin (Life Technologies, cat. #32-2500), and/or
beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #A5441) at dilutions of
1:2,000, 1:10,000, and 1:5,000, respectively, in Odyssey
Blocking Buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20
(Fisher Scientific, cat. #BP337). Following washes
with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 hour
at room temperature with IRDye 800CW Goat antiMouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (LI-COR Biosciences,
cat. #926–32210) using dilution of 1:20,000 in Odyssey
Blocking Buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and
0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Affymetrix, cat.
#77504). Following washes with TBST, the membranes
were scanned using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences, model #9120) for target protein
detection. Signal quantification was performed using
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System software.

The experiment was performed as previously
described, with slight modifications [80]. Briefly, the
base agarose layer was prepared in 6-well culture plates
by pouring 2 ml of base agarose mixture comprised of
1X DMEM, 10% FBS, and 0.5% agarose (Affymetrix,
cat. #32802). Cells were prepared in top agarose mixture
comprised of 1X DMEM, 10% FBS, and 0.35% agarose,
and poured over the solidified base agarose layer at final
seeding density of 5,000 cells/well. After solidification of
the top layer, 2 ml of growth media with 0 or 2 μg/ml
DOX were added to each well, and samples were placed
in a 37°C incubator. Cells were allowed to incubate for
4 weeks, with the overlaid media and DOX exchanged
thrice weekly. At the termination of the experiment,
samples were rinsed twice with DPBS and fixed with
3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #252549) for
10 minutes. After two more washes with DPBS, cells
were stained with 0.01% crystal violet (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, cat. #sc-207460) for 1 hour. Photographs
were taken using EVOS FL Imaging System, and colonies
were counted using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD). To exclude background, only colonies >
10,000 μm2 were counted.

Cell proliferation assay

The experiment was performed as described
in Corning’s Cell Invasion Assay protocol (available
online at the following URL: http://csmedia2.corning.
com/LifeSciences/media/pdf/protocol_DL_031_Cell_
Invasion_Assay.pdf). Briefly, permeable supports
(Corning, cat. #353097) were coated with 200 μg/ml
Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Corning, cat.
#354234), and inserted in 24-well companion plates
(Corning, cat. #353504). Cell suspensions were prepared
in serum-free DMEM, and seeded in invasion chambers at
25,000 cells/chamber. DMEM with 20% FBS was added
to each well as chemoattractant. Samples were incubated
at 37°C for 24 hours to allow for cell migration through
the Matrigel. Non-invading cells on the apical surface of
the Matrigel-coated supports were removed with cotton

In vitro scratch assay
Cells were pre-treated with 0 or 2 μg/ml DOX for
5 days, then seeded in 6-well culture plates and allowed
to grow to confluence. The cell monolayer was scratched
in a straight line with a p200 pipet tip, then rinsed twice
with DPBS to remove debris. Fresh culture medium was
added, with 2 μg/ml DOX in the appropriate wells. Every
12 hours, photographs of the scratches were taken using
EVOS FL Imaging System. The mean width of each
scratch was measured using ImageJ. Data were plotted
relative to the 0 hour time point.
Matrigel invasion assay

Cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at
250 cells/well, and allowed to grow for 0–10 days in
media containing 0 or 2 μg/ml DOX. At each indicated
time point, cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco’s
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Life Technologies,
cat. #14190), and lysed with deionized water. Doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) was stained by Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Life Technologies, cat.
#P7581), and fluorescence intensity was measured
by a microplate reader (Tecan, part #F129015) using
excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission
wavelength of 535 nm. Data were plotted relative to
day 0 to provide estimates of cell proliferation based on
dsDNA content.

swabs, and cells that had migrated to the lower surface of
the supports were stained using Differential Quik Stain Kit
(Polysciences, cat. #24606). Photographs were taken, and
cells were counted using ImageJ. Samples were prepared
in triplicate, and 5 fields were photographed per sample (at
20X magnification).

Mia.CTRL xenografts, the experiment was terminated
on day 72, upon clear evidence that DOX diet had no
significant effect on tumor growth over a prolonged
time period. Upon termination of the experiment,
mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide inhalation
followed by cervical dislocation, and tumors were
harvested.

Mouse xenografts

Messenger ribonucleoprotein-immunoprecipitation
(mRNP-IP)

Mouse protocols were approved by the Thomas
Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

mRNP-IPs were performed as previously
described [81]. Briefly, MIA PaCa-2 cytoplasmic lysates
were obtained using CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction
Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #NXTRACT) according to
manufacturer’s instructions, with the modification of
supplementing with 100 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Life
Technologies, cat. #N8080119) to preserve RNA
integrity. HuR protein and its bound mRNA cargo were
immunoprecipitated by incubating the cytoplasmic
lysates with mRNP-IP-grade HuR antibody (MBL
International Corporation, cat. #RN004P) or isotype
control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. #sc-2027)
pre-coated to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich,
cat. #P9424). HuR was digested with proteinase K (Life
Technologies, cat. #AM2546), and the released mRNA
transcripts were purified with TRIzol Reagent for further
analysis.

siHuR lipidoid nanoparticle study
We encapsulated siRNAs in the lipidoid nanoparticle
98N12-5, as previously described [58]. The targeted
sequences were as follows: firefly luciferase siRNA (siLuc)
= sense 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA-3′, antisense
5′-UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAG-3′; HuR siRNA
(siHuR) = sense 5′-GCGUUUAUCCGGUUUGACA-3′,
antisense
5′-UGUCAAACCGGAUAAACGC-3′.
Nine 6-week-old, female, athymic nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories, cat. #6904F) received subcutaneous
injections of 2 × 106 MIA PaCa-2 cells in both flanks.
Cells were prepared in 100 μl solution comprised of
80% DPBS and 20% Matrigel (Corning, cat. #356237).
Tumors were allowed to grow to mean tumor volume
of ~100 mm3, whereupon mice were randomly assigned
to 3 groups. Mice received intratumoral injections
of  1) PBS; 2) siLuc lipidoid nanoparticle; or 3) siHuR
lipidoid nanoparticle, following the treatment regimen
of 25 mg/kg, twice per week for 2 weeks. Tumors were
measured at the indicated time points using an electronic
caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula Volume = Length × Width2/2. Upon termination
of the experiment, mice were euthanized using carbon
dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, and
tumors were harvested.

NanoString nCounter® assay, data normalization and
filtering, multivariate statistical analysis, and pathway
analysis
For the identification of cancer-related transcripts
that were differentially expressed between MIA PaCa2 cells transfected with control siRNA or HuR siRNA,
200 ng each of total RNA samples were analyzed with the
nCounter® GX Human Cancer Reference Kit (NanoString
Technologies; see Table S1 for the complete gene list)
according to manufacturer’s protocols [59]. Six positive
hybridization controls that do not correspond to any
known transcript sequence were added at fixed amounts
into each sample. Eight probes served as negative
controls that were used to estimate the background noise
(average plus three standard deviations for each sample).
Transcripts with expression lower than this threshold in
four or more samples were filtered out of the analysis. The
remaining 157 transcripts were then normalized based
on the geometric mean of the positive controls for each
sample. From the resulting table, the three transcripts
with the lowest coefficient of variation (CoV) were
chosen (CoV  <  7%): FOSL2, TNFRSF10B, and ABL1.
These transcripts were flagged as “housekeeping genes,”
and the values in each sample were further normalized
based on the consideration that the geometric mean of the
expressions of these transcripts should remain unchanged

DOX-inducible HuR knockdown study
6-week-old, female, athymic nude mice received
subcutaneous injections of 2 × 106 Mia.sh290 cells
or 1.5 × 106 Mia.CTRL cells in both flanks (10 mice
per cell line). Cells were prepared in 100 μl solution
comprised of 80% DPBS and 20% Matrigel. Starting on
the day of injection, 5 mice were fed 200 mg/kg DOX
diet (Bio-Serv, cat. #S3888), while the other 5 mice
were maintained on control diet (Bio-Serv, cat. #S4207).
Tumors were measured three times per week using an
electronic caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated
using the formula Volume = Length × Width2/2. For the
Mia.sh290 xenografts, the experiment was terminated
on day 39, when one of the tumors surpassed 1,500 mm3
(a  pre-defined requirement for termination). For the

standardized before multivariate statistical analysis.
Principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical
clustering (HCL; Pearson correlation metric), and
significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) were
performed using the TM4-MeV statistical analysis
software, as previously described [82–84]. Pathway
enrichment was run using the Database for Annotation,
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [85,
86]. Specifically, enrichment for biological process (BP)
terms of gene ontology (GO) was sought. The background
list for the enrichment analysis was the full list of 236
genes included in the nCounter® GX Human Cancer
Reference Kit.
For the identification of the cancer-related transcripts
that HuR directly binds, 200 ng each of HuR and control
IgG mRNP-IP RNA samples were analyzed with the
nCounter® GX Human Cancer Reference Kit, as above.
Data filtering and positive control normalization were
also performed as described above. To identify binders,
the average of the normalized counts of the two HuR
mRNP-IP replicates had to be at least twice the maximum
of the normalized counts of the two control IgG mRNP-IP
replicates. Fold enrichment for each binder was calculated
as the ratio of its average expression in the HuR mRNP-IP
samples relative to the average signal of the non-binders.
Further details in regards to statistics are available
upon request.
