Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer world-wide with 1.2 million patients
diagnosed yearly. In late stage CRC, the most commonly used targeted therapies are monoclonal
antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which inactivate EGFR1. Recent studies have identified
alterations in KRAS2–4 and other genes5–13 as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary
resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of
resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in CRC and little is known about
determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in
CRC on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, we performed complete exome sequence and
copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumorgrafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55
patient tumors, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analyzed the response of tumors to antiEGFR antibody blockade in tumorgraft models or in clinical settings. In addition to previously
identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as
potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of
EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and
sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumors with
increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be
overcome in tumorgraft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes. These
analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluate response to targeted therapies in human cancer,
highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and provide new avenues for
intervention in the management of CRC.
To examine genetic alterations that affect response to anti-EGFR therapy, we selected 137
CRCs from liver metastases that were KRAS wild-type as determined by Sanger sequencing
(Supplementary Table 1). To elucidate genetic alterations in these cancers, we enriched for
neoplastic cells using patient-derived tumorgrafts and performed exome sequencing of
tumorgraft and matched normal DNA (Supplementary Tables 1–2). This approach identified
sequence changes and copy number alterations in >20,000 genes with an average coverage
within the target regions of nearly 150-fold for each sample (Supplementary Tables 3–4).

Author Manuscript

Sequence analyses of 135 of 137 tumors identified a median of 117 somatic mutations in
each cancer. Two tumors displayed an elevated number of somatic alterations (2979 and
2480 changes per exome), consistent with a mutator phenotype. Common CRC driver genes
were identified at expected frequencies in the tumors analyzed (Supplementary Tables 3–5).
Eight tumors were identified as having KRAS alterations that were not initially detected by
Sanger sequencing and were excluded from further analysis, resulting in 129 KRAS wildtype tumors.

To evaluate whether identified alterations were associated with resistance to EGFR
inhibitors, we determined tumorgraft response to cetuximab therapy for 116 of the 129
KRAS wild-type CRCs (Figs. 1, 2). The volume of each tumorgraft was evaluated at three
and six weeks and tumors were categorized as showing disease progression, regression, or
stabilization. Among tumorgrafts with disease progression (increase in tumor volumes over
35%) or suboptimal stabilization (increase in tumor volumes between 20 and 35%), we
detected alterations in all genes known to be involved in EGFR therapeutic resistance:
NRAS codon 12 or 61 mutations (7 cases), BRAF V600E mutation (3 cases), MET
amplification (3 cases), and ERBB2 amplification (4 of 5 cases). Additionally, 3 of 4 tumors
with alterations in exon 20 of PIK3CA and 4 of 5 tumors with protein truncating or
homozygous deletions of PTEN were resistant to anti-EGFR blockade.

We evaluated potential mechanisms of resistance that have not been previously described in
CRC. We focused on cell surface receptors or members of the EGFR signaling pathway to
identify candidate genes that were altered in therapy-resistant tumors (Fig. 2, Extended Data
Fig. 1; Supplementary Tables 3–4). We observed point mutations affecting the ERBB2
kinase domain, including in two tumors with the same change at V777L and another tumor
harboring an L866M mutation, as well as a sequence change in the ectodomain at S310Y, all
of which correlated with cetuximab resistance. Although amplification of ERBB2 has been
reported in CRCs9,10,14, sequence alterations of this gene have not been linked to therapeutic
resistance to anti-EGFR blockade. These data suggest that somatic mutations in ERBB2 may
provide an alternative mechanism for ERBB2 pathway activation that is complementary to
ERBB2 amplification in CRC. Similarly, we found sequence alteration in the kinase domain
of EGFR (V843I) in one case that showed tumor growth in the presence of cetuximab.
Although EGFR kinase alterations are rare in CRC15,16, the observed case suggests that in
principle such changes may provide a mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.
We identified alterations in additional protein kinase receptors in tumors resistant to
cetuximab treatment: amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR1 and
sequence alterations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFRA. Each of these
was altered in four of the 129 CRC samples analyzed (8 samples total, 6%). FGFR1 is a
known driver in human cancers17 and has been reported to be amplified in different tumor
types. PDGFRA is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is known to be mutated in gastro-intestinal
stromal tumors18. The detected sequence alterations in PDGFRA, including a mutation that
affected the same residue in two different patients (R981H), were all located in or near the
catalytic domain of the protein. Similar to ERBB2 and MET, the receptors encoded by these
genes transmit signals through the RAS/MEK cascade and when mutated can lead to
constitutive activation of oncogenic pathways17,19.

Author Manuscript

We further examined candidate alterations within the RAS pathway and observed a K57R
change in the mitogen activated protein kinase gene MAP2K1 in a cetuximab-resistant case.
Alterations of MAP2K1 at the same or nearby residues have been previously described in
various cancers, are adjacent to the catalytic domain, and have been shown to confer IL-3independent cell growth in vitro, suggesting that this mutation may be functionally active20.
Overall, the enrichment of mutations in these pathways in the resistant tumorgrafts was

statistically significant (p<0.001, Welch Two Sample t-test) and suggests that alterations in
any of these members may be sufficient to render cells insensitive to EGFR inhibition.
To extend the observations, we analyzed 65 cetuximab-naïve samples from patients who
were subsequently treated with anti-EGFR therapy as part of clinical trials or standard of
care. We detected coding alterations in genes known to be involved in EGFR therapeutic
resistance, including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN sequence mutations, and
amplification of MET and ERBB2 (total of 25 cases with mutation in at least one resistance
gene). In the remaining 40 cases, we confirmed observations of alterations in several genes
with novel resistance mechanisms, including sequence changes in ERBB2 and PDGFRA
(Supplementary Tables 1–3).

Although some tumors respond to cetuximab, virtually all CRC patients develop disease
recurrence. In our analyses, 22 tumors were from patients that received cetuximab within six
months prior to resection (Supplementary Table 1). We examined whether alterations in
these cases may have arisen as acquired (secondary) resistance to therapy. Two of these 22
tumors had somatic sequence changes in EGFR (G465R or G465E) affecting domain III of
the extracellular portion of the receptor. Structural analyses suggested that these mutations
were likely to affect cetuximab binding as they were located at the interface of EGFR –
cetuximab interaction (Fig. 3A, Extended Data Fig. 2). Interestingly, G465 is structurally
adjacent to residue S492 that has been shown, when altered, to interfere with cetuximab
binding11 (Fig. 3A). We sequenced pre- and post-therapy specimens for the two patients
(CRC104 and CRC177) whose tumors harbored the ectodomain mutations. In both cases,
we confirmed the EGFR mutations in the post-cetuximab metastases while the original pretreatment specimens did not have detectable alterations (Fig. 3B–C).

Among CRC patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, only 12–17% have durable responses to
anti-EGFR monotherapy4,6. We wondered whether such responses may be due to alterations
in genes that confer therapeutic sensitivity. EGFR was found to be amplified in two tumors
that showed either regression (CRC98, 26 fold amplified) or disease stabilization (CRC400,
3 fold amplified) (Fig. 2) consistent with previous observations21,22. Given the importance
of EGFR signaling in CRC, we analyzed other pathway members that were preferentially
mutated in responsive tumors and identified IRS2, a cytoplasmic adaptor that mediates
signaling between receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream targets (Fig. 2., Supplementary
Table 6) (p<0.05, Welch Two Sample t-test). IRS2 had amplifications or sequence alterations
in 7 tumors (10%) that showed increased sensitivity or stable disease when treated with
cetuximab. Expression analyses of 100 CRC tumorgrafts with wild-type KRAS, NRAS,
BRAF, and PIK3CA identified increased IRS2 levels as a significant predictor of cetuximab
sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 3). A few tumors that were not responsive to cetuximab
harbored IRS2 alterations together with known resistance changes including those in MET
or BRAF. These observations suggest that IRS2 mutations may predict anti-EGFR
sensitivity in cases without other mechanisms of resistance to EGFR therapy. We and others
have previously identified alterations in IRS2 in CRCs and other tumor types, but no reports
to date have linked the effects of these alterations to therapeutic sensitivity14,23.

To evaluate the role of these novel alterations, we performed functional assays in NCI-H508,
a cetuximab-sensitive CRC cell line that does not harbor known resistance-conferring
mutations24,25 and displays a 3-fold gene copy number gain of the IRS2 gene
(Supplementary Tables 3–4). We found that ectopic introduction of either EGFR G465E or
MAP2K1 K57N into NCI-H508 cells induced resistance to EGFR inhibition and increased
activation of downstream signals, which were not affected by EGFR blockade (Extended
Data Fig. 4A–B). Conversely, knockdown of IRS2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted
in reduced sensitivity to cetuximab and less pronounced activation of ERK and AKT
following ligand stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 4C). This is consistent with the role of
IRS2 as a scaffold/adaptor protein that amplifies signals downstream from tyrosine kinase
receptors.

Given the poor outcome of patients diagnosed with late stage CRC, we investigated whether
mutant genes observed in individual cases may be clinically actionable using existing or
investigational therapies. We identified somatic alterations with potentially actionable
consequences in 100 of the 129 patients (77%) (Supplementary Table 7). To test whether any
of the identified alterations may be successfully targeted in tumors with cetuximab
resistance, we used the tumorgrafts to perform proof-of-principle trials for targeted therapies
and evaluated the signaling consequences of these therapies in vivo (Fig. 4 and Extended
Data Fig. 5–10). We chose a cetuximab-resistant tumor with FGFR1 amplification
(CRC477) and examined whether inhibition of both FGFR1 and EGFR would be more
effective than inhibition of EGFR alone. We confirmed resistance to cetuximab alone and, as
may be expected using a single inhibitor, the tumorgraft was also resistant to monotherapy
with the selective FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398, which is currently in clinical trials (Fig.
4A). However, combination of BGJ398 with cetuximab led to a substantial and durable
suppression of tumor growth in all treated mice. This model confirmed that combinatorial
therapies may be effective in overcoming EGFR therapeutic resistance in tumors with
alterations in other cell surface receptors.

Author Manuscript

An analogous approach was used to evaluate the EGFR small-molecule inhibitor afatinib in
tumor CRC334 containing sequence change V843I in the protein kinase domain of EGFR.
Similar to our observations for FGFR1 targeting, treating tumorgrafts with afatinib or
cetuximab alone was not effective but the combination resulted in marked and long lasting
tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 4B). We also found that combinations of MEK and ERK
inhibitors in tumorgraft CRC343 (MAP2K1 K57N), and the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib and
cetuximab in tumorgraft CRC525 (PDGFRA R981H), exerted strong antitumor activities
(Fig. 4C and D), although the effect was short-lived in the PDGFRA mutant tumor.
Targeting of ERBB2 mutations in cetuximab-resistant CRC tumorgrafts has been recently
demonstrated using dual HER2-targeted therapy in a separate study (Kavuri SM et al., in
press). Consistent with the observed higher efficacy of combination therapies, we found that
the impact of therapies on downstream signals was stronger when tumors were targeted by
drug combinations compared with single-agent treatments (Extended Data Fig. 5–10).
Next, we evaluated alternative therapeutic approaches in tumors with secondary cetuximabresistant alterations in the EGFR ectodomain. Although previous reports have shown that
cetuximab-resistant tumors with S492R alterations in EGFR are sensitive to panitumumab11,

tumorgrafts with EGFR G465E mutation were poorly sensitive to panitumumab (Fig. 4E).
Structural analyses indicate that the S492 residue is in the cetuximab binding site within
EGFR domain III while G465 is located in the center of the region in which the epitopes of
both antibodies overlap26 (Extended Data Fig. 2). This lack of sensitivity was not due to
absence of EGFR dependence as kinase inhibition of EGFR using afatinib resulted in
reduction of tumor growth (Fig. 4E). To explore whether EGFR inhibition by antibodies
targeting epitopes far from G465 might overcome resistance we used Pan-HER
(Symphogen), a monoclonal antibody mixture that binds EGFR epitopes different from
those recognized by cetuximab and panitumumab27 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Similar results
using Pan-HER were observed in CRC177 with EGFR G465R mutation (Fig. 4F).

Our genomic analyses have detected essentially all previously known mechanisms of
resistance to cetuximab in CRC. The results identified novel candidate mechanisms of
primary and secondary resistance through alterations affecting EGFR, its downstream
signaling pathway, and other cell surface receptors (Extended Data Fig. 1). These alterations,
together with KRAS, comprise over three quarters of cetuximab resistant tumors and suggest
that the vast majority of mechanisms of primary resistance have now been determined and
can be identified prior to the initiation of anti-EGFR treatment.

Author Manuscript

Some of the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR therapy provide new avenues for
intervention, including amplification of FGFR1 and mutations of PDGFR1, ERBB2, and
MAP2K1. As we have shown, combinations of therapies targeting both the protein products
encoded by resistance genes as well as EGFR or other signaling partners are likely to be
crucial for inhibiting the multiple genetic components within a tumor. Although
combinatorial treatments in tumorgrafts often led to arrest of tumor growth rather than
regression, disease stabilization is prognostically relevant and is the most common
consequence of EGFR-targeted therapies in responsive CRC patients4. The high fraction of
tumors with actionable alterations suggests that additional combinatorial therapies may be
clinically useful for CRC patients.

Author Manuscript

An unexpected finding was the identification of IRS2 alterations as a novel mechanism of
sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Our genetic and functional data suggest that IRS2
alterations may identify tumors that are dependent on receptor signaling and therefore
sensitive to its therapeutic inhibition. Consistent with this prediction are reports that IRS2
amplification is a significant indicator of response to the IGF1R inhibitor figitumumab in
colorectal and lung cancer cell lines28. Given the interaction of IRS2 with multiple cell
surface receptors, we would predict that combinatorial inhibition of these receptors in
tumors with IRS2 alterations may provide additional avenues of intervention in such
patients.
This study highlights information that may be obtained through the integration of large-scale
genomic and targeted therapeutic analyses in CRC and provide an unprecedented view into
mechanisms of sensitivity as well as primary and secondary resistance to EGFR blockade.
This information provides a framework for analysis of responses to targeted therapies in
CRC and suggests interventional clinical trials using combinatorial therapies based on
potentially actionable alterations.

The study population consisted of matched tumor and normal samples from 137 colorectal
cancer patients that underwent surgical resection of liver metastases at the Candiolo Cancer
Institute (Candiolo, Torino, Italy), the Mauriziano Umberto I Hospital (Torino) and the San
Giovanni Battista Hospital (Torino) from 2008–2012. Informed consent for research use was
obtained from all patients at the enrolling institution prior to tissue banking and study
approval was obtained from the ethics committees of the three centers. Tumors with KRAS
alterations at codons 12, 13 and 61 that were detected using Sanger sequencing were not
included in the study. From the resected tumor samples, tumorgraft models were established
as described below. Following exome sequence analyses, 8 tumorgrafts were detected to
have KRAS mutations (patients CRC18, CRC58, CRC68, CRC237, CRC312, CRC328,
CRC344, CRC382) and were excluded from further analyses. To assess genomic similarity
between tumorgrafts and the tumors from which they were derived, 18 pre-implantation liver
metastases were analyzed through targeted next generation sequencing and compared to the
corresponding tumorgrafts. Pathological analyses showed that tumor cellularity of the
metastatic samples ranged from 15% to 90% (average 59%), supporting the need for
enrichment of tumor cells through growth of tumorgrafts. Targeted next generation
sequencing revealed that all the clonal alterations identified in these tumorgrafts were
present in the tumors from which they were derived (Supplementary Table 3), similar to
previous comparisons of tumorgrafts and primary tumors in CRC29. To extend observations
of alterations in resistance mechanisms that we have identified in tumorgrafts, an additional
65 patient-derived cetuximab-naïve clinical samples from patients who were subsequently
treated with EGFR blockade through standard of care or various clinical trials including
NCT00113763, NCT00891930, NCT00113776, and NCT0112645030 were analyzed
through targeted genomic analyses (Supplementary Table 9). Available clinical information
for all samples is shown in Supplementary Table 2.
Tumorgraft models and in vivo treatments

Author Manuscript

Tissue from hepatic metastasectomy in affected individuals was fragmented and either
frozen or prepared for implantation as described previously9,31. NOD/SCID (nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) female mice (4 to 6 weeks old) were used for
tumor implantation. Nucleic acids were isolated from early passaged tumorgrafts. The
remaining tumorgraft material was further passaged and expanded into treatment groups.
The size of the animal groups (n = 5–6) and schedule of measurements (1 measurement at
baseline and 5 sequential weekly measurements on treatment) were calculated to detect a
difference of tumor volumes between mice treated with monotherapy and mice treated with
combination therapies. Therefore, 3 comparisons were considered as primary objective for
each experiment. To preserve a family-wise error of 5% (1 side), a Bonferroni correction
was applied and a type 1 error of 0.017 for each of the three comparisons was considered.
This resulted in a power of 80% to detect a standardized comparison of 0.70. Animals with
established tumors defined as an average volume of 400 mm3 were treated with vehicle or
drug regimens, either as a single-agent or in combination as indicated: cetuximab (Merck,
White House Station, NJ) 20 mg/kg/twice-weekly i.p.; BGJ398 (Sequoia Research Products,

Research Products), 100 mg/kg/once-daily by oral gavage; panitumumab (Amgen, Thousand
Oaks, CA), 20 mg/kg/twice-weekly i.p.; afatinib (Sequoia Research Products), 20 mg/kg/
once-daily by oral gavage; AZD6244 (Sequoia Research Products), 25 mg/kg/once-daily by
oral gavage; SCH772984 (ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN), 75 mg/kg/once daily i.p.; Pan-HER
(Symphogen), 60 mg/kg twice-weekly i.p. To evaluate sensitivity to cetuximab
monotherapy, each tumorgraft was evaluated at three and six weeks in 12 or 24 mice
(depending on individual models) that were randomized to treatment and control arms at a
1:1 ratio. For assessment of tumor response to therapy, we used volume measurements
normalized to the tumorgraft volume at the time of cetuximab treatment initiation.
Tumorgrafts were classified as follows: (i) tumor regression with a decrease of at least 35%
in tumor volume (39 cases, 34%), (ii) disease progression with at least a 35% increase in
tumor volume (36 cases, 31%), and (iii) disease stabilization with a tumorgraft volume at
levels <35% growth and <35% regression (41 cases, 35%). Tumors displaying regression or
stabilization continued treatment for additional 3 weeks. Tumor size was evaluated once per
week by caliper measurements and the approximate volume of the mass was calculated.
Statistical significance for tumor volume changes was calculated using mixed-design
ANOVA (repeated measures) when all mice were available for measurements in each
treatment group at each timepoint, and two-way ANOVA when one or more mice died
accidentally over the course of the experiments. Results were considered interpretable when
at least half of mice per treatment group (n = 3) survived until the pre-specified endpoints
(minimum, 3 weeks of treatment). All mice alive at endpoint were included in the analysis
(CRC477: 6 mice treated with placebo or cetuximab, 4 mice treated with BGJ398, 3 mice
treated with cetuximab + BGJ398; CRC334: 5 mice treated with cetuximab + afatinib, 6
mice per treatment group in all other arms; CRC525: 5 mice per treatment group in all arms;
CRC343: 5 mice treated with AZD6244 + SCH772984, 6 mice per treatment group in all
other arms; CRC104: 4 mice treated with panitumumab + afatinib, 6 mice per treatment
group in all other arms; CRC177: 5 mice per treatment group in all arms). Operators
allocated mice to the different treatment groups during randomization but were blinded
during measurements. In vivo procedures and related biobanking data were managed using
the Laboratory Assistant Suite (LAS), a web-based proprietary data management system for
automated data tracking32. All experiments were conducted with approval from the Animal
Care Committee of the Candiolo Cancer Institute, in accordance with the Italian legislation
on animal experimentation.
Sample preparation and next-generation sequencing

DNA was extracted from patient’s tumor, early passage tumorgrafts developed from liver
metastases, normal samples (adjacent non-cancerous liver or peripheral blood), and from
normal tissue of the same mouse strain as those used to grow the xenografts using the
Qiagen DNA FFPE tissue kit or Qiagen DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, CA). Additional
analyses were performed for CRC334 after afatinib anti-EGFR therapy and tumorgraft
regrowth (indicated in footnote of Supplementary Table 4). Genomic DNA from tumor and
normal samples were fragmented and used for Illumina TruSeq library construction
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions or as previously
described33. Exonic or targeted regions were captured in solution using the Agilent

SureSelect v.4 kit or a custom targeted panel according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) (Supplementary Table 9). The captured library was then purified
with a Qiagen MinElute column purification kit and eluted in 17 μl of 70°C EB to obtain 15
μl of captured DNA library. The captured DNA library was amplified in the following way:
Eight 30uL PCR reactions each containing 19 μl of H2O, 6 μl of 5 × Phusion HF buffer, 0.6
μl of 10 mM dNTP, 1.5 μl of DMSO, 0.30 μl of Illumina PE primer #1, 0.30μl of Illumina
PE primer #2, 0.30 μl of Hotstart Phusion polymerase, and 2 μl of captured exome library
were set up. The PCR program used was: 98°C for 30 seconds; 14 cycles (exome) or 16
cycles (targeted) of 98°C for 10 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds; and
72°C for 5 min. To purify PCR products, a NucleoSpin Extract II purification kit (MachereyNagel, PA) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end sequencing,
resulting in 100 bases from each end of the fragments for exome libraries and 100 or 150
bases from each end of the fragment for targeted libraries, was performed using Illumina
HiSeq 2000/2500 and Illumina MiSeq instrumentation (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Primary processing of next-generation sequencing data and identification of putative
somatic mutations

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Somatic mutations were identified using VariantDx33 custom software for identifying
mutations in matched tumor and normal samples. Prior to mutation calling, primary
processing of sequence data for both tumor and normal samples were performed using
Illumina CASAVA software (v1.8), including masking of adapter sequences. Sequence reads
were aligned against the human reference genome (version hg18) using ELAND with
additional realignment of select regions using the Needleman-Wunsch method34. Candidate
somatic mutations, consisting of point mutations, insertions, and deletions were then
identified using VariantDx across the either the whole exome or regions of interest.
VariantDx examines sequence alignments of tumor samples against a matched normal while
applying filters to exclude alignment and sequencing artifacts. In brief, an alignment filter
was applied to exclude quality failed reads, unpaired reads, and poorly mapped reads in the
tumor. A base quality filter was applied to limit inclusion of bases with reported phred
quality score > 30 for the tumor and > 20 for the normal. A mutation in the tumor was
identified as a candidate somatic mutation only when (i) distinct paired reads contained the
mutation in the tumor; (ii) the number of distinct paired reads containing a particular
mutation in the tumor was at least 2% of the total distinct read pairs for targeted analyses
and 10% of read pairs for exome and (iii) the mismatched base was not present in >1% of
the reads in the matched normal sample as well as not present in a custom database of
common germline variants derived from dbSNP and (iv) the position was covered in both the
tumor and normal. Mutations arising from misplaced genome alignments, including
paralogous sequences, were identified and excluded by searching the reference genome.
Potential alterations were compared to mouse sequences from experimentally obtained
mouse whole-exome and targeted sequence data as well as the reference mouse genome
(mm9) to remove mouse-specific variants. Candidate somatic mutations were further filtered
based on gene annotation to identify those occurring in protein coding regions. Functional
consequences were predicted using snpEff and a custom database of CCDS, RefSeq and
Ensembl annotations using the latest transcript versions available on hg18 from UCSC
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Predictions were ordered to prefer transcripts with canonical

start and stop codons and CCDS or Refseq transcripts over Ensembl when available. Finally
mutations were filtered to exclude intronic and silent changes, while retaining mutations
resulting in missense mutations, nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or splice site alterations. A
manual visual inspection step was used to further remove artifactual changes. Amplification
analyses were performed using the Digital Karyotyping approach35 by comparison of the
number of reads mapping to a particular gene compared to the average number of reads
mapping to each gene in the panel, along with a minor allele fraction analysis of
heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contained within each gene. For
comparison of somatic alterations in tumorgraft and pre-implantation material, we
considered all alterations where the mutation was present in at least 20% of the read pairs in
the tumorgraft samples. To evaluate whether mutant genes observed in individual cases may
be clinically actionable using existing or investigational therapies, we examined altered
genes that were associated with 1) FDA-approved therapies for oncologic indications, 2)
therapies in published prospective or retrospective clinical studies, and 3) ongoing clinical
trials for patients with CRC or other tumor types.
Gene expression analyses
Data were obtained using a HumanHT-12 v4 Illumina beadarray technology. Following data
normalization, genes were collapsed to the probe displaying highest mean signal. Gene
expression values were then Log2-transformed and centered to the median (Supplementary
Table 10). IRS2 expression in 100 tumorgrafts with wild-type forms of KRAS, NRAS,
BRAF, and PIK3CA was compared to cetuximab response by one-way ANOVA and
Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test.
Statistical analyses for genes with somatic alterations

Author Manuscript

Using the approach previously described36, we analyzed 24,334 somatic mutations
(nonsynonymous and synonymous single base substitutions plus indels) identified in the
protein coding sequence of 127 tumorgraft samples, after samples with KRAS hotspot
mutations (codons 12 or 13) and those with a mutator phenotype were excluded. We
implemented the following statistical framework to identify significantly mutated genes by
incorporating background mutation rates, gene length, and base composition.

Author Manuscript

Inspired by previous works37,38, our model defines gene-specific background mutation rates,
which capture exome-wide as well as gene-specific sequence-based parameters. We define 8
exhaustive and disjoint sequence-based dinucleotide contexts: C in CpG, G in CpG, C in
TpC, G in GpA, and all other A, G, C, T. We represent the occurrences of each context in the
entire protein coding sequence by Ni, and in each gene of interest by gi. Subsequently, we
identify the dinucleotide context for all single base substitution (SBS) somatic mutations
identified and derive the counts of mutations in each context over all CDS (protein coding
sequence) (ni). We derive the expected probability of observing a mutation in a base
occurring in the CDS of a gene of interest as follows:

(1)

(2)

where fi denotes the fraction of bases in dinucleotide context i in the entire CDS, where a
mutation has been observed. The context parameters Ni and gi are defined as the total
number of occurrences of each context sequenced across all of the samples; therefore
following the simplifying assumption of full coverage of the entire protein coding sequence,
and assuming K samples total, these parameters will be K times those of a single haploid
exome.

Author Manuscript

Following the definition of fi, we derive the background probability of observing at least
mg,obs mutations in a gene of interest, using the binomial tail probability of Lg trials with
mg,obs successes and Pmut probability of success in each trial. Here, Lg represents the length
of the CDS of the gene times the number of samples.
(3)

We use an equivalent formulation to model the statistical significance of observing qg,obs
insertions/deletions (indels) in a gene of interest. The background indel frequency (Pindel) is
defined as the number of indels recovered in the entire CDS of the sequenced samples
divided by the length of the entire CDS available in these samples.
(4)

Author Manuscript

The two statistical tests described above (3,4) reflect the significance of mutation counts in a
gene, but are blind to the protein-level consequence of mutations. To capture the impact of
mutation on protein, we apply an extension of the tests above that examines enrichment for
nonsynonymous mutations in the set of single base substitution mutations identified in a
gene of interest. We define a background, gene-specific ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous (NS/S) mutations, given the exome-wide NS/S ratio in each dinucleotide
context (ri) and the sequence composition of each gene as follows. Note that gi has the same
definition as in (1).

Given the NS/S ratio for a gene of interest, the probability of an observed mutation in the
gene being nonsynonymous is:

Following this step, the binomial tail probability of observing
mutations in a gene of interest is:

from the total of mg,obs

Author Manuscript

The three test statistics (3, 4, 7) rely on three distinct measures for calling a gene
significantly mutated: the counts of single base substitutions, the counts of indels, and the
relative counts of nonsynonymous to synonymous single base substitutions. Assuming the
independence of these measures, given gene-specific parameters of gi and Lg, we combine
them using Fisher’s combined probability test to derive a measure of overall significance for
each gene of interest (combined p-value). We acknowledge the fact that Fisher’s combined
probability test is best suited to p-values derived from continuous probability distribution
functions; however, it has been shown that its application to p-values derived from discrete
probability distributions results in conservative estimates of p-value.
Finally, we apply Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction method to combined pvalues to control for multiple testing.
Statistical analyses for therapeutic resistance or sensitivity

Author Manuscript

Statistical models for tumor growth were implemented for each of four mutation profiles that
were correlated to resistance or sensitivity to cetuximab treatment. Group A samples had
ERBB2 mutations and/or amplification, MET amplification, EGFR mutations affecting the
ectodomain or kinase domain, NRAS mutation, BRAF V600E, FGFR1 amplification,
PDGFRA mutations affecting the kinase domain and MAP2K1 K57N. Group B samples had
ERBB2 mutations, EGFR mutations affecting the ectodomain or kinase domain, FGFR1
amplification, PDGFRA mutations affecting the kinase domain or MAP2K1 K57N. Group C
samples had amplification of EGFR or a mutation or amplification of IRS2 while group D
samples had amplification or mutation of IRS2. As IRS2 alterations are likely to be
predictive of anti-EGFR response in cases without other mechanisms of resistance to EGFR
therapy, we excluded two samples that harbored a MET amplification or BRAF mutation
from Group C and D. For each group, Wilcoxon rank sum and two sample Welch t-tests
were used to evaluate differences in the mean tumor growth between samples with mutation
and those without.
Protein structure modeling

Author Manuscript

The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor in
complex with the Fab fragment of cetuximab was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB
entry #1YY9). This PDB entry contains a complex of 3 biomacromolecules including the
extracellular portion of EGFR, cetuximab Fab Light chain, and cetuximab Fab Heavy chain.
The EGFR-cetuximab complex was visualized using Deep View Swiss-pdbviewer
(SPDBV_4.10_PC).

NCI-H508 and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 and Iscove
medium, respectively. Cell lines were authenticated for genetic identity by short tandem
repeat profiling (Cell ID, Promega, Fitchburg, WI) and routinely PCR-tested for
mycoplasma contamination (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany). EGFR G465E and
MAP2K1 K57N in the PS100069 lentiviral vectors were custom-cloned by and purchased
from OriGene (Rockville, MD). The MISSION lentiviral pLKO.1-puro shRNA vector
targeting IRS2 (target sequence: GTGAAGATCTGTCTGGCTTTA), as well as the nontargeting control vector, were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All vectors were
produced by lipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Monza, Italy)-mediated transfection
of 293T cells. Primary antibodies included: rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr1068-EGFR (ab5644)
(Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom); rabbit anti-EGFR (D38B1), rabbit anti-IRS2
(L1326), rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473-AKT (D9E), rabbit anti-AKT (11E7), rabbit antiphospho-Thr202/Tyr204-ERK (D13.14.4E), rabbit anti-ERK (137F5) (Cell Signaling
Technology, Billerica, MA); mouse anti-DDK (4C5) (Origene); mouse anti-tubulin (DM1A)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Proliferative response was assessed with an ATP content
assay as an indicator of cellular viability. On day 0, cells were plated at clonal density (20
cells/μl) in complete medium. On day 1, serially-diluted cetuximab or vehicle (PBS) was
added to the cells. On day 6, cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo (Promega) using
Victor X4 (PerkinEmler, Waltham, MA) or GloMax (Promega) microplate luminometers.
Pharmacodynamic analyses

Author Manuscript

Tumorgrafts were embedded in paraffin and subjected to immunoperoxidase staining with
rabbit monoclonal antibodies against phospho-S6 (Ser235/236, clone D57.2.2E, Cell
Signaling Technology, Billerica, MA) or phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, clone
D13.14.4E, Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with secondary antibodies,
immunoreactivities were revealed by incubation in DAB chromogen (Dako, Cernusco sul
Naviglio, Italy). Images were captured with the Leica LAS EZ software using a Leica DM
LB microscope (Mannheim, Germany). For morphometric quantitation, 5 fields/section at
40× from two tumors from two different mice for each treatment modality (n = 10) were
analyzed using ImageJ. Immunoreactivity for phospho-ERK and phospho-S6 was quantified
by spectral segmentation of images in two layers: one layer excluded stroma and empty
spaces (such as lumens); the second layer measured DAB positivity. The percentage of
immunoreactive cells was calculated as DAB positivity divided by total cancer cell area.
Software outputs were manually verified by visual inspection of digital images.

those recognized by cetuximab

Author Manuscript

A) The H383 (green) residue and the S484/G485 residues (light blue) in EGFR domain III
are critical for the binding of Pan-HER anti-EGFR antibodies 1277 and 1565, respectively27.
Antibodies 1277 and 156527 bind to an epitope distinct from that of cetuximab, which may
contribute to the superior tumor growth inhibition in the presence of mutations at residue
465. Mutations identified in this study affecting G465 (red) and the S492 amino acid
(yellow) previously reported to confer cetuximab resistance11 are shown for reference.
Similarly to mutations affecting S492, the alterations at 465 that we identified in this study
(G465R and G465E) involve changes from a nonpolar uncharged side chain to large
electrically charged arginine or glutamic acid residues, respectively, and predict resistance to
cetuximab. B) Critical EGFR amino acids selectively recognized by both cetuximab and
panitumumab as determined by phage screening are shown in blue and include P373, K467,

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of integrated genomic and therapeutic analyses

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of genomic alterations on sensitivity to anti-EGFR blockade, we
performed whole exome and copy number analyses of 129 early passage tumorgrafts and
targeted analyses of 55 patient tumors, all of which were KRAS wild-type (top box).
Twenty-two of tumorgrafts were from patients that had been previously treated with antiEGFR therapy. 116 of these tumorgrafts were evaluated for response to cetuximab in
preclinical therapeutic trials (bottom left box). Integration of genomic and therapeutic
information was used to identify candidate resistance and response genes, and to design
preclinical trials using novel compounds to overcome resistance to EGFR blockade (bottom
right box).

Waterfall plot of tumor volume changes after cetuximab treatment, compared with baseline,
in 116 KRAS wild-type tumorgrafts. Alterations related to therapeutic resistance or
sensitivity are shown in the indicated colors (complete list of alterations are in Tables S3, S4
and S6). For the following genes a subset of alterations are indicated: MET amplification;
FGFR1 amplification; PDGFRA kinase domain mutations; BRAF V600 hotspot mutations;
PTEN homozygous deletion or truncating mutations; PIK3CA exon 20 mutations; EGFR
ecto- and kinase domain mutations and amplifications. The maximum threshold for tumor
growth was set at 200%.

mutations in two CRCs with acquired resistance to cetuximab. Cetuximab-naïve samples
were sequenced to investigate the presence of EGFR G465 mutations (red) prior to
treatment. For each sample, the fraction of mutant tags is indicated. c, As a control for tumor
cellularity, for each lesion the fraction of TP53 mutant reads (vertical axis) was plotted
against the fraction of reads with EGFR ectodomain mutations (horizontal axis).
