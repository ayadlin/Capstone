Abstract
Cisplatin and its analogues are the most commonly used agents in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we investigated a possible role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and degradation in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Cisplatin treatment led to an
increase in initial EGFR phosphorylation at Y1045, the binding site of ubiquitin ligase, Casitas B-lineage
lymphoma (c-Cbl), followed by ubiquitination in the relatively cisplatin-sensitive cell lines. However, cisplatin-resistant cell lines underwent minimal EGFR phosphorylation at the Y1045 site and minimal ubiquitination. We found that EGFR degradation in response to cisplatin was highly correlated with cytotoxicity in
seven head and neck cancer cell lines. Pretreatment with EGF enhanced cisplatin-induced EGFR degradation and cytotoxicity, whereas erlotinib pretreatment blocked EGFR phosphorylation, degradation, and
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Expression of a mutant Y1045F EGFR, which is relatively resistant to
c-Cbl–mediated degradation, in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the UMSCC11B human head and neck
cancer cell line protected EGFR from cisplatin-induced degradation and enhanced cell survival compared
with wild-type (WT) EGFR. Transfection of WT c-Cbl enhanced EGFR degradation and cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity compared with control vector. These results show that cisplatin-induced EGFR phosphorylation
and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation is an important determinant of cisplatin sensitivity. Our
findings suggest that treatment with an EGFR inhibitor before cisplatin would be antagonistic, as EGFR
inhibition would protect EGFR from cisplatin-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination
and degradation, which may explain the negative results of several recent clinical trials. Furthermore, they
suggest that EGFR degradation is worth exploring as an early biomarker of response and as a target to
improve outcome. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2862–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cisplatin and its analogues are among the most commonly
used and effective agents in the treatment of head and neck
cancers (1–4), as well as several other solid tumors, including
those of the lung, testis, bladder, and ovary (5–7). Cisplatin
induces cytotoxicity through the production of DNA damage
caused by the formation of cisplatin-DNA adducts (8), which
leads to irreparable DNA damage and, ultimately, cell death.
Cisplatin-DNA adduct formation might trigger downstream effects that could potentiate cisplatin toxicity. One
such potential downstream effect of cisplatin-induced

DNA damage that could affect cell survival occurs through
the degradation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). Cancer cell survival is maintained by EGFR
independent of its kinase activity. Weihua and colleagues
(9) found that the knockdown of EGFR with small interfering RNA led to cell death in an autophagic process. Nishikawa and Donato (10, 11) reported a central role for EGFR
expression in cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore,
Niwa and colleagues (12) used an antisense approach to
target EGFR to inhibit the growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), finding that treatment with
a combination of docetaxel and EGFR antisense oligonucleotides resulted in increased cytotoxicity and reduced
tumor volumes compared with monotherapy. Using this approach, Lai and colleagues (13) showed that intratumoral
EGFR oligonucleotide injection is safe and resulted in antitumor activity in patients with advanced HNSCC. Therefore,
it is hypothesized that agents which could induce or potentiate EGFR degradation would sensitize the cells driven by
EGFR.
We recently found that treatment of head and neck cancer cells with gemcitabine caused EGFR phosphorylation
and subsequent degradation, and that inhibition of EGFR

Role of EGFR Degradation in Cisplatin Sensitivity

degradation using the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 increased cell survival (14). As cisplatin is the most commonly
used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of HNSCC,
we sought to understand the possible role of EGFR phosphorylation and degradation in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity using specific genetic techniques rather than
potentially nonspecific proteasomal inhibitors. We found
that treatment with cisplatin, like gemcitabine, led to an increase in EGFR phosphorylation followed by degradation in
sensitive cell lines, and that this degradation strongly correlates with cytotoxicity. We then investigated the implications of cisplatin-induced EGFR degradation in the
rational design of combination therapy involving EGFR inhibitors and chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Cisplatin was acquired from Bedford Laboratories. Phosphorylated EGFR (pY845EGFR), c-Cbl, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Phosphorylated Y1045 (pY1045EGFR) antibody was obtained from Millipore. EGFR (Sc-03) and ubiquitin antibodies were acquired
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Erlotinib was kindly provided by Genentech. EGF was obtained from Sigma.
Cell culture. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
The human HNSCC cell lines UMSCC1, 10B, 11B, 12, 17B, 29,
and 33, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma ME-180Pt cells
were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas E. Carey (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). All cell lines were grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone).
For all in vitro experiments, cells were released from flasks
using PBS containing 0.01% trypsin and 0.20 mmol/L of
EDTA, and 6 × 105 cells were plated onto 100-mm culture
dishes 2 d before any treatment.
Immunoblotting. Cells were scraped into PBS containing a
sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche Diagnostic, Co.). Cells were incubated for 15 min on
ice in Laemmli buffer [63 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 2% (w/v) SDS,
10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue] containing 100 mmol/L of NaF, 1 mmol/L of Na3Vo4, 1 mmol/L
of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/mL of aprotinin.
After sonication, particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The soluble protein
fraction was heated to 95°C for 5 min, then applied to a 4% to
12% bis-tris precast gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer consisting of 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum
in TBS [137 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20]. Membranes were subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with 1 μg/mL of primary antibody
in blocking buffer, washed, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling). After three additional washes in TBS, bound
antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence plus

reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For quantification of relative protein levels, immunoblot films were scanned and analyzed using the ImageJ 1.32j software (NIH). Unless otherwise
indicated, the relative protein levels shown represent a comparison with nontreated controls.
Immunoprecipitation. Following treatments, cells were
trypsinized, washed twice with 1× PBS, and cell lysates were
prepared by incubation for 30 min on ice in fresh lysis buffer
[1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodacyl sulfate, 0.15 mol/L
sodium chloride, 0.01 mol/L sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1
mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/mL aprotinin,
0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 2 mmol/L EDTA, and 20 mmol/L ammonium molybdate]. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR was performed as
previously described (14).
Measurement of mRNA levels of EGFR in cells treated
with cisplatin. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems) and purified (Millipore Centrifugal Filter Units). Diluted cDNA was used to amplify GAPDH (F, 5′-GAG TCA ACG
GAT TTG GTC GT-3′; and R, 5′-TTG ATT TTG GAG GGA
TCT CG-3′) and EGFR (F, 5′-CTC AGC CAC CCA TAT GTA
CC-3′; and R, 5′-CGT CCA TGT CTT CTT CAT CC-3′) by
quantitative reverse-transcription PCR using SYBR green
chemistry (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and melting
curve analysis was carried out to confirm the specificity of
the product. The δδCt method was used to analyze the data
as described (15, 16) and GAPDH was used as control.
Clonogenic cell survival assay. Clonogenic assays were
performed using standard techniques (17). The fraction surviving each treatment was normalized to the survival of the
control cells. Cisplatin cell survival curves were fitted using
the equation SF = (C50)m / [(C50)m + Cm], in which SF is the
surviving fraction, C is the cisplatin concentration, C50 is the
concentration of cisplatin that produces a 50% cell survival,
and m is the slope of the sigmoid curve. The effects of EGF,
or erlotinib, on cisplatin-induced clonogenic death were calculated by comparing the ratio of the areas under the respective cell survival curves.
Plasmid constructions and transfections. A site-directed
mutagenesis approach was used to create the Y1045F substitution in the pEYFP-N1 vector. The mutation was confirmed by
sequencing the plasmid in the DNA sequencing core at the University of Michigan. Wild-type (WT) EGFR in the pEYFP-N1
vector was provided by Dr. Zhixiang Wang (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). The WT c-Cbl construct was
provided by Dr. Nancy Lill (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa).
UMSCC11B and CHO cells were transiently transfected with
the constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer.
Live cell imaging. Live cell imaging of CHO and
UMSCC11B cells transfected with WT EGFR and Y1045F
EGFR constructs was performed using an Olympus DP70
camera fitted in an Olympus 1X-71 microscope. All the
images were captured at ×60 magnification and processed

Results
EGFR degradation in HNSCC cell lines correlates with
cisplatin sensitivity. Our initial goal was to determine if
there was a correlation between cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and EGFR degradation. Cisplatin cytotoxicity was assessed by clonogenic survival analysis in seven HNSCC cell
lines, UMSCC1, 10B, 11B, 12, 17B, 29, 33, and in the cisplatin-resistant cervical carcinoma ME-180Pt cell line. We selected ME-180Pt cells for use along with the head and neck
cancer cell lines because platinum resistance in this cervical
cancer line has previously been reported to be associated
with higher expression of EGFR (10, 11). Our results revealed
that the UMSCC17B and 11B lines were the most sensitive,

and UMSCC1 and ME-180Pt were the most resistant, with
the other cell lines displaying intermediate sensitivity
(Fig. 1A). Based on these results and clinically achievable levels of cisplatin (18), we selected a 2-hour exposure to 10
μmol/L of cisplatin to assess the effects of cisplatin treatment on EGFR protein level by immunoblotting relative to
nontreated controls in each of the eight cell lines. We found
a direct relationship between relative EGFR levels at 72 hours
and surviving fraction after cisplatin treatment (R2 = 0.97;
Fig. 1A). For example, in response to 10 μmol/L of cisplatin,
the relatively cisplatin-sensitive UMSCC11B cell line showed
a 95% decrease in EGFR levels at 72 hours, whereas the relatively cisplatin-resistant ME-180Pt line showed almost no
change in EGFR levels at 72 hours (Fig. 1B).
We then sought to determine whether cisplatin, like gemcitabine, caused initial EGFR phosphorylation followed by
subsequent degradation in head and neck cancer cell lines.
We chose UMSCC11B as a representative cisplatin-sensitive
and UMSCC1 and ME-180Pt as cisplatin-resistant cell lines
for further studies. We observed increased phosphorylation
of EGFR at both the Y845 and Y1045 positions in (sensitive)

Figure 1. Effect of cisplatin on cell survival and EGFR degradation in various cell lines. Clonogenic survival assays were performed on eight cell lines
(UMSCC1, 10B, 11B, 12, 17B, 29B, 33, and ME-180Pt) to assess cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Each cell line was exposed to 10 μmol/L of cisplatin for 2 h,
then either plated for clonogenic survival or harvested at the indicated time points and immunoblotted for various total and phosphorylated proteins and
GAPDH (as a loading control). A, densitometric analysis was performed for total EGFR levels; ratios of EGFR protein levels at 72 h compared with
nontreated controls were plotted against survival fractions as assessed by colony formation assay. B, representative immunoblots of EGFR, pY845EGFR,
pY1045EGFR, pERK1/2, tERK1/2, and GAPDH from UMSCC1, ME-180Pt, and UMSCC11B cell lines. C, UMSCC1, ME-180Pt, and UMSCC11B cells
were treated with 10 μmol/L of cisplatin for 2 h and were immunoprecipitated (IP) for EGFR, then immunoblotted (IB) with ubiquitin at the indicated times. D,
after treatment with 10 μmol/L of cisplatin for 2 h, RNA was extracted at 24 and 72 h from UMSCC1, ME-180Pt, and UMSCC11B cells and real-time
PCR analysis for EGFR and GAPDH was performed. EGFR transcript levels were normalized to GAPDH levels at the same time point.

Role of EGFR Degradation in Cisplatin Sensitivity

Figure 2. Promotion of EGFR phosphorylation facilitates cisplatin-induced EGFR degradation, whereas inhibition of phosphorylation protects against
degradation. ME-180Pt cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) for 30 min and then treated with various doses of cisplatin for 2 h; medium was replaced
with drug-free medium and cells were plated for clonogenic survival assays (A) or harvested for immunoblotting at the indicated times (B). UMSCC11B
cells were treated with erlotinib (3 μmol/L) for 2 h and then treated with various doses of cisplatin for 2 h. Medium was replaced with drug-free medium, and
cells were plated for clonogenic survival assays (C), or harvested at the indicated time points and immunoblotted for EGFR and GAPDH (D).

UMSCC11B cells. We also noted a moderate increase in the
phosphorylation of EGFR at the Y845 site, but little to no increase in phosphorylation of the Y1045 site in (resistant)
UMSCC1 and ME-180Pt cells. The pY845 and pY1045 EGFR
levels decreased by 72 hours in the cisplatin-sensitive
UMSCC11B cell line. However, in cisplatin-resistant UMSCC1
and ME-180Pt, pY845 EGFR levels remained high at 72 hours.
These results showed that the phosphorylation of EGFR at
Y1045 was more strongly correlated with cisplatin cytotoxicity than the Y845 site and suggested to us that the Y1045 site
might be critical for the eventual degradation of EGFR in response to cisplatin. To determine if this observed EGFR
phosphorylation affected signaling, we analyzed the downstream mediators of EGFR signaling in these cell lines. As anticipated, pERK levels were significantly increased in
UMSCC11B by 2 hours and then decreased at 72 hours in a
similar manner to pEGFR levels. In cisplatin-resistant
UMSCC1 and ME-180Pt, we noticed an initial moderate increase in pERK levels, which did not decrease appreciably
by 72 hours, also consistent with pEGFR levels.
Role of EGFR ubiquitination in cisplatin-induced EGFR
degradation. To determine whether the decrease in EGFR
levels was due to decreased production or increased degradation, we assessed ubiquitination of EGFR at 2 and 6 hours
after treatment with cisplatin in cisplatin-sensitive and
cisplatin-resistant cell lines. In the sensitive cell line
UMSCC11B, we observed EGFR binding to ubiquitin in response to cisplatin (Fig. 1C), whereas in the relatively
resistant cell line ME-180Pt, there was no increase in ubiquitination of EGFR at 2 and 6 hours after cisplatin treatment.
This lack of ubiquitination was congruent with the lack of
EGFR degradation in these cells. UMSCC1 cells showed a
slight increase in ubiquitinated EGFR at 6 hours, but not
as substantial as was observed in UMSCC11B cells. Therefore,
ubiquitination of EGFR in the three cell lines was directly

correlated with levels of Y1045 phosphorylation of EGFR in
response to cisplatin. We further carried out EGFR transcript
analysis in UMSCC1, ME-180Pt, and UMSCC11B cells. Realtime PCR results showed an increase in EGFR transcript
levels in response to cisplatin at both 24 and 72 hours compared with controls in UMSCC11B (Fig. 1D). These results
suggested that the decrease in EGFR levels was occurring
at the protein level, and its transcript level might be undergoing a partially compensatory upregulation. In the case of
UMSCC1 and ME-180Pt, EGFR transcript levels did not increase at 24 and 72 hours but in fact slightly decreased for
ME-180Pt (Fig. 1D). We also analyzed the effects of cisplatin
on EGFR degradation after blocking protein synthesis using
cyclohexamide (50 μg/mL) in UMSCC11B cells. EGFR degradation was more rapid in the case of cells treated with the
combination of cisplatin and cyclohexamide compared with
cyclohexamide alone (Supplementary Fig. S1), confirming
that EGFR degradation was occurring earlier than it was detected through immunoblotting, and suggesting that the increase in transcription of EGFR was partially compensating
for the loss of protein.
Effects of EGF and erlotinib on cisplatin-induced EGFR
degradation. We next hypothesized that if EGFR phosphorylation were critical for its eventual degradation, then pretreatment with EGF would enhance cisplatin-induced EGFR
degradation whereas erlotinib would protect EGFR from degradation. For these experiments, ME-180Pt (resistant) cells
were treated with EGF (10 ng/mL) for 1 hour before cisplatin
was added to the cells. As we anticipated, EGF induced rapid
EGFR degradation by 24 hours after treatment with cisplatin
(Fig. 2A). Cell survival data for EGF and cisplatin combination showed a significant decrease in clonogenic survival
with combined cisplatin and EGF compared with cisplatin
alone in ME-180Pt cells (Fig. 2B). Conversely, pretreatment
of UMSCC11B (sensitive) cells with erlotinib (3 μmol/L) for

2 hours before the addition of cisplatin protected EGFR from
cisplatin-induced degradation at 72 hours, supporting a critical role for EGFR phosphorylation in cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation (Fig. 2C). Likewise, pretreatment with erlotinib significantly protected UMSCC11B cells from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2D). Erlotinib pretreatment also
protected UMSCC1 cells from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings emphasize the important role of initial EGFR phosphorylation followed by degradation in cisplatin cytotoxicity.
Effects of Y1045F EGFR construct on cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation and cytotoxicity in CHO cells. We next
hypothesized that blocking EGFR phosphorylation at the
Y1045 residue, which is necessary for binding with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and thus required for EGFR degradation,
would protect cells from cisplatin-induced toxicity. We initially tested our hypothesis in a system with no endogenous

expression of EGFR to avoid the confounding effects of native EGFR. We selected CHO cells that were EGFR negative
(19) but upon transfection with EGFR constructs are able to
not only express EGFR but also to activate normal downstream signaling events (20, 21). We used WT EGFR and
Y1045F EGFR constructs in the N1-EYFP vector backbone
to monitor changes in EGFR levels and localization in response to cisplatin in live cells. CHO cells were transfected
with either WT EGFR or Y1045F EGFR constructs, treated
with cisplatin, and assessed for EGFR levels at 24 and 72
hours after treatment (Fig. 3A). We detected a more rapid
disappearance of WT EGFR when compared with Y1045F
EGFR, verifying that the Y1045 site is important for EGFR
degradation. Immunoblotting data also confirmed these results (Fig. 3A, middle). We then assessed the role of EGFR
degradation in cisplatin toxicity. As expected, expression of
the Y1045F EGFR construct in CHO cells induced significant

mutant forms of EGFR were transfected into CHO or UMSCC11B cells. A, CHO cells were treated with cisplatin (10 μmol/L) for 2 h and representative
images were taken at 2, 24, and 72 h or harvested on either day 1 or day 3 for immunoblotting. B, CHO cells were treated with various doses of cisplatin,
harvested on day 1, and plated for colony formation assay. The dose-modifying factor is defined as the area under the curve of mutant over WT
EGFR–transfected cells. C, UMSCC11B cells were transfected with the Y1045F and WT EGFR constructs. Cells were treated with cisplatin (3 μmol/L)
for 2 h and images were taken at 2, 24, and 72 h or harvested for immunoblotting at 72 h. D, UMSCC11B cells were treated with various doses of cisplatin,
harvested on day 1, and plated for colony formation assay.

EGFR-expressing cells (dose modifying factor, 1.5; Fig. 3B).
Effects of Y1045F EGFR construct on cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation and cytotoxicity in UMSCC11B cells.
Next, we sought to extend our findings on the critical role
of the 1045 phosphorylation of EGFR to a head and neck cancer cell line. We transfected UMSCC11B cells with WT or
Y1045F EGFR constructs and treated cells with cisplatin to
monitor the effects on transfected EGFR in these cells. Similar to our results in CHO cells, we found a more rapid decrease in WT EGFR compared with Y1045F EGFR in response
to cisplatin (Fig. 3C). In addition, although the high endogenous levels of EGFR make it more difficult to detect a difference in EGFR levels after transfection of the mutant, we
found that Y1045F-transfected cells were protected from cisplatin-induced EGFR degradation (Fig. 3C). Importantly, cells
expressing the Y1045F EGFR construct were significantly
protected from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 3D).
These results, especially when combined with those obtained
in the CHO system described above, strengthen the importance of Y1045 phosphorylation of EGFR in cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation and resulting cytotoxicity.
Effects of WT c-Cbl overexpression on cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation and cytotoxicity in UMSCC11B cells. To
further assess the role of EGFR degradation in cisplatininduced cytotoxicity in head and neck cancer, we decided
to accelerate ubiquitination by enhancing the ability of
c-Cbl to bind EGFR. Therefore, we transfected UMSCC11B
cells with a control vector and WT c-Cbl constructs and
assessed the effects on EGFR degradation and cytotoxicity.
We found that cells transfected with WT c-Cbl showed enhanced EGFR degradation compared with control vectortransfected cells (Fig. 4A). WT c-Cbl–transfected cells had a
greater sensitivity to cisplatin than cells transfected with
control vector construct (Fig. 4B). We further found that after
cisplatin treatment, WT c-Cbl–expressing cells underwent
increased ubiquitination of EGFR compared with cells expressing the control vector (data not shown). These results
confirm that a sufficient degree of EGFR degradation (in this
case, achieved by enhancing c-Cbl activity to degrade ∼90%
of EGFR) increases cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity.

Discussion
In this study, we show that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in head and neck cancer is critically dependent on
the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of EGFR.
This conclusion is supported by our findings that (a) decreased EGFR levels after cisplatin treatment correlate
with decreased clonogenic survival; (b) stimulation of
EGFR phosphorylation and degradation (by treatment with
EGF) before cisplatin treatment increases cytotoxicity; and
(c) inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and degradation
(by pretreatment with erlotinib) before cisplatin diminishes
cytotoxicity. Using distinct genetic methods of preventing
and accelerating EGFR degradation, we then confirmed
that preventing degradation decreases cisplatin cytotoxicity, whereas promoting EGFR degradation increases cisplatin cytotoxicity. These findings elucidate a new step in
the process by which cisplatin produces cell death and
suggest that enhancing EGFR degradation may be a novel
way of overcoming cisplatin resistance in head and neck
cancer cells. Furthermore, our findings provide insight into
maximizing the therapeutic benefit of EGFR inhibitors
when used in combination with chemotherapy.
Substantial evidence now shows that radiation and chemotherapy induce EGFR phosphorylation and activation of
downstream survival pathways. For example, Benhar and colleagues (22) reported that cisplatin-induced EGFR phosphorylation coincides with DNA adduct formation, suggesting that
a DNA damage sensor activates (directly or indirectly) EGFR
and downstream cell survival pathways. Others have suggested that cisplatin induces EGFR activation through a p38
mitogen-activated kinase and that this activation leads to
downstream effectors such as protein kinase B/AKT (23). In
addition, phosphorylated EGFR could undergo nuclear translocation and interact with DNA protein kinase (24) and could
also mediate DNA repair (25). Likewise, ionizing radiation
produces EGFR activation and nuclear translocation, which
stimulates repair mechanisms (24). Nuclear localization of
EGFR has also been found to be important for its role as a
transcription factor that activates genes required for cell
growth and proliferation (26). Inhibition of this activation of

downstream survival and repair signals by treatment with an
EGFR inhibitor after chemotherapy causes dramatic potentiation of cell death (14, 27), which has clinical implications as
described below.
In contrast to EGFR activation after chemotherapy and
radiation, the role of treatment-induced EGFR degradation
has been much less appreciated. Our prior finding that
gemcitabine causes EGFR degradation and cell death (14)
and the results of our current study show that radiation-1
and chemotherapy-induced degradation causes cell death
downstream of the initial DNA damage. Our findings are in
agreement with a recent study showing that the loss of EGFR
could induce autophagic cell death (9) and that antisense oligonucleotides against EGFR could produce clinical responses (13).
Thus, the degradation of EGFR might decrease the ability of
cells to repair damaged DNA, leading to increased cytotoxicity.
Our studies are consistent with several preclinical studies
that have shown a direct correlation between EGFR activation and sensitivity to cisplatin (28–31). In particular, Christen
and colleagues (32) reported that the stimulation of ovarian
carcinoma cells with EGF sensitized cells to cisplatin, independent of the mitogenic effects of EGF. Similarly, Nishikawa
and colleagues (10) found that the cisplatin-resistant cervical
carcinoma cell line ME-180Pt (used in our study) was sensitized to cisplatin by EGF pretreatment. Although the mechanism by which EGF sensitized cells to cisplatin was not
elucidated, we would hypothesize that EGF increased EGFR
activation and subsequent degradation.
As we now know that both cisplatin treatment and EGF
stimulation could cause EGFR phosphorylation leading to receptor degradation, it is of interest to compare the mechanisms of these two processes. EGFR is internalized and
degraded following stimulation with EGF through binding
with c-Cbl at the phosphorylated Y1045-EGFR residue (33),
which is a docking site for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (33,
34). Similarly, in response to treatment with cisplatin, we
found that EGFR is phosphorylated at the Y1045 site, ubiquitinated and degraded through c-Cbl, which occurs in degradation after ligand binding. Thus, it seems that EGFR
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation after EGF
stimulation resemble the results from cisplatin treatment, although differences might still emerge with further study.
Irrespective of the exact mechanism of cisplatin-induced
EGFR degradation, our results suggest that that the schedule
of EGFR inhibition and chemotherapy could have a crucial
effect on the effectiveness of therapy. We have found that
the activation of EGFR is necessary for its subsequent degradation and resultant chemosensitization. Under these conditions, the addition of an EGFR inhibitor before cisplatin
treatment prevents EGFR activation, thereby resulting in a cytoprotective effect. In contrast, treatment with chemotherapy or radiation first, leading to EGFR activation, followed by
an EGFR inhibitor (depriving the cell of downstream “life”
and DNA repair signaling) stimulates degradation and has
a synergistic cytotoxic effect (27, 35). This is consistent with

previous studies examining combination treatment with
EGFR inhibitors and chemotherapy, in which it has been
suggested that EGFR phosphorylation in response to chemotherapeutic agents (29, 36) or antimetabolites (37, 38) is
necessary for the chemosensitization benefit of added EGFR
inhibitors. Thus, our findings might provide the underlying
biological rationale to the paradoxical clinical observations
that although EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy could
increase treatment efficacy, the converse schedule could
actually be antagonistic (39).
It may be possible to develop new methods of potentiating
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity by discovering new ways of increasing cisplatin-induced EGFR degradation. Under conditions of cellular stress, the molecular chaperone heat shock
protein 90 (Hsp90) regulates the stability of several oncoproteins (40). Yang and colleagues (41) have reported that the
association of mutant EGFR with Hsp90 decreases its downregulation mediated by c-Cbl binding. It is also known that
ErbB-2 can bind to both EGFR and Hsp90 directly. Whether
an EGFR-Hsp90 interaction (directly or through ErbB-2) is
involved in cisplatin-induced EGFR activation and degradation is not known at this time. In addition to EGFR and
stress-related molecular interactions, it would also be interesting to explore if the interaction between EGFR and DNAPK plays a role in cisplatin-induced cell death.
In summary, we show here that EGFR phosphorylation
and degradation is a determinant of cisplatin cytotoxicity
in head and neck cancer cells, and that this degradation is
mediated by c-Cbl. At present, the mechanism of cisplatininduced signaling in EGFR degradation is not known. Regardless of the mechanism of degradation, our results suggest that
the incorporation of EGFR inhibitors into therapy may be
most effective following cisplatin administration and may
even be antagonistic if given before cisplatin. Thus, our results indicate that EGFR inhibitors should be used after
chemotherapy to facilitate EGFR degradation and chemosensitization. These findings also indicate that agents
which facilitate EGFR degradation should be explored in
overcoming cisplatin resistance.
