ABSTRACT
K-Ras mutations are frequently detected in pancreatic and colon cancers, which
are associated with the resistance to MEK inhibitors targeting the Ras pathway.
Identifying the underlying mechanisms for the acquired resistance is essential for
the future clinical development of MEK inhibitors. Here, we identified that Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) was significantly activated
following the MEK inhibition using AZD6244, PD98059 and Trametinib in K-Ras mutant
pancreatic and colon cancer cells. The STAT3 activation may be important for the
MEK inhibitor resistance in these K-Ras mutant cancer cells. We have shown that
dual inhibition of STAT3 and MEK using the STAT3 inhibitor LY5 and MEK inhibitor
Trametinib exerts significant anti-tumor cell efficacy in K-Ras mutant pancreatic and
colon cancer cells in vitro. In addition, Trametinib showed increased suppression on
tumor growth in vivo in STAT3 knockdown pancreatic cancer cells compared with
tumor growth of control cells without STAT3 knockdown. Taken together, our results
suggest the induced STAT3 activation as a possible mechanism for the resistance to
MEK inhibitor and demonstrate the potentials of a combination therapy using MEK and
STAT3 inhibitors in pancreatic and colon cancers harboring K-Ras mutant proteins.

INTRODUCTION

codon 13, 17, 34, or 61; COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer) database [5]. In pancreatic cancer,
mutations are essentially seen only at the codon 12, with
rare exceptions at codon 13 [5-7]. Mutations at codon
12 are commonly found of substitution of glycine with
aspartic acid (G12D), valine (G12V), cysteine (G12C)
or others [8] resulting in a conformational change of a
protein site located near the bound nucleotide (GTP) and
leads to constitutive activation of the mutated Ras proteins
independently of growth factor stimulation. In colon
cancer, the most frequent mutations in K-Ras are guanine
to adenine transitions and guanine to thymine-conversion

Ras proteins play a direct causal role in human
cancers. Oncogenic mutant Ras proteins are highly
prevalent in multiple human tumors (~30% of all human
tumors), with mutations of K-Ras being the major clinical
problem [1]. Oncogenic K-Ras mutations occur in 90%
of pancreatic and 45% of colorectal carcinomas [2], and
these mutations are associated with the resistance to MEK
inhibitors [3, 4]. K-Ras mutations in cancers are localized
frequently at codon 12 and much less commonly at

with 90% of the somatic point mutations occurring at
hotspot codon 12 (G12D, 70%) or 13 (G13D, 30%) in
exon 1 [9-11]. Moreover, cancers with a high prevalence
of K-Ras mutations, such as pancreatic carcinomas,
colorectal cancers and lung cancers are difficult to
treat. Clinical outcomes are poor even with aggressive
and toxic medical interventions [12, 13]. Suppressing
K-Ras mutants has become a promising concept for new
therapies. Recently, inhibitors of K-Ras mutants have been
developed and tested to show some activity in cancer cell
lines and tumor models [14, 15]. However, K-Ras mutant
have been proven highly difficult to drug, and no small
molecular K-Ras mutant inhibitors are available for
clinical trials yet. This places the K-Ras mutants target
in the so-called difficult-to-drug target category [16, 17].
With the failure of directly inhibiting K-Ras mutant,
inhibiting downstream effectors of K-Ras appears a
promising alternative [18]. K-Ras signals via downstream
effectors such as MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 signaling
cascade [19-21]. It has been shown MAPK signaling plays
a more important role in tumor maintenance than PI3K
signaling in K-Ras mutant pancreatic and lung tumors
[22, 23]. Drug development efforts have mostly focused
on components of the classical Ras-activated MAPK
pathway. As part of this pathway, MEK1/2, a dual-specific
kinase required for activation of ERK1/2, plays crucial
roles in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and inhibition of
apoptosis, therefore, MEK1/2 inhibition is an attractive
therapeutic strategy in a number of cancers. Inhibiting the
downstream effector MEK1/2 has proven to be effective
in preclinical studies. Several MEK inhibitors (AZD6244,
trametinib and others) have been developed and are
under investigation in clinical studies in colon cancer
[24-26] and pancreatic cancer [27, 28]. MEK inhibitors
have the potential to inhibit tumors dependent on MAPK
signaling pathway. Unfortunately, drug resistance limits
their efficacy in some patients. Resistance to MEK
inhibitors has been reported in pancreatic cancer and colon
carcinoma with Ras mutations. However, the underlying
mechanism is not very clear. Elucidating the mechanism
of cancer cell resistance to MEK inhibitors is critical for
the development of more effective therapies.
Our preliminary results have shown that the MEK
inhibition in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells
and colon cancer cells unexpectedly induced STAT3
phosphorylation/activation. STAT3 is an oncogene, which
is constitutively activated in multiple types of human
cancers and contributes to cancer progression [29, 30].
STAT3 activation can stimulate oncogenic transformation
in cultured cells and tumor formation in nude mice [31].
In contrast, STAT3 deficient fibroblasts are resistant to
transformation by a variety of oncogenes [32,33]. STAT3
is activated (persistent phosphorylation of STAT3) in
many human pancreatic [19, 34, 35] and colon cancer
cells [36-41]. However, STAT3 is not persistently active in
normal pancreatic tissues and not required for pancreatic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

development or homeostasis [42]. Activation of STAT3 is
also a marker of poor prognosis in human colon cancer
[43]. Persistent STAT3 signaling is an attractive target
due to its role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis,
invasion, angiogenesis and immune suppression [29].
Furthermore, STAT3 inhibition can promote apoptosis of
human pancreatic [44-48] and colon cancer cells [36, 38,
49] in vitro and in vivo. Since STAT3 phosphorylation/
activation can be induced by MEK inhibitors, we
hypothesize that the combined treatment with STAT3 and
MEK inhibitors would have enhanced therapeutic effects
in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer and colon cancer cells
compared with MEK or STAT3 inhibitor alone.
In this study, we observed that STAT3 pathway
activation is a hallmark response to MEK inhibition in
K-Ras mutated cells, and found that co­inhibition of STAT3
and MEK mediators could overcome this resistance.
Phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 can also occur
upstream upon the activation of Janus kinases (JAKs). We
further assessed the anti-tumor effects of JAK2/STAT3
inhibitor and MEK inhibitor as single agents and in various
combinations in K­-Ras mutated pancreatic and colon cells
in vitro, as well as nude mice tumor model in vivo. The
results may provide a basis for further development of
novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of K-Ras
mutant cancer.

RESULTS
Increased STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation
induced by MEK inhibitors in K-Ras mutant
pancreatic cancer cells
MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, showed activity in K-Ras
mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer in clinical
trials [50] and is being investigated for pancreatic cancer
therapy in phase II clinical trials [28]. To investigate
whether MEK inhibitors activate JAK2/STAT3 signal
pathways, we examined the effects of MEK inhibitors in
K-Ras mutant cancer cell lines. First, we tested the effects
of AZD6244 in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells.
Pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 (G12D) and Capan-1
(G12V) were treated with 10 μM of AZD6244 for 2472 hours. As expected, AZD6244 effectively inhibited
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2) in the two cell lines
(Figure 1A and 1B). Interestingly, AZD6244 induced
STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation, P­
-STAT3 (Y705), in
both PANC-1 and Capan-1 cells at the different time point,
but it did not increase P-STAT3(S727) in Capan-1 cell
(Figure 1A and 1B). To further determine whether STAT3
activation was associated with MEK inhibition, we tested
another small molecule MEK inhibitor PD98059 [51] in a
different K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cell line, AsPC1 (G12D). As anticipated, PD98059 increased P-STAT3

(Y705) and P-STAT3 (S727) in AsPC-1 (G12D) cells.
However, P-STAT3 (S727) was not markedly increased
(Figure 1C). AZD6244 and PD98059 are not approved
for clinical use by the FDA. Trametinib, another MEK
inhibitor, has been approved for treating melanoma
[52,53]. So, we tested trametinib in the AsPC-1 (G12D)
and HPAC (G12D) cells. Similarly, P-STAT3(Y705)
was significantly increased in AsPC-1 and HPAC cells
after 24 or 48 hours of the treatment with trametinib at
different concentrations, while P-STAT3 (S727) was not
markedly increased (Figure 1D and 1E). Here, remarkable
increases in P-STAT3(Y705) upon MEK inhibition were
observed in all four pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figure
1) whereas, slight increases in P-STAT3(S727) were
observed in three cancer cell lines (Figure 1A, 1C and 1E).
In the Capan-1(Figure 1B) and AsPC-1(Figure 1D) cells,
P-STAT3(S727) was virtually unchanged or decreased.
These results suggest that activation of STAT3 upon MEK
inhibition is mainly by phosphorylation of Tyr705 residue.
Src family kinases have been found to activate

STAT3 and linked to drugs resistance in some cell lines
and patient samples [54]. We therefore examined the
activation of the Src proteins in K-Ras mutant pancreatic
cancer cells (AsPC-1 as a representative). In AsPC-1 cells
with the treatment of AZD6244, PD98059 or trametinib
resulted in a slight increase of P-Src (Y416) (Figure 1C
and 1D), suggesting the activation of P-STAT3 may not
be dependent on Src family kinases. JAK and GP130
are direct upstream effectors of STAT3. Overexpression
of JAK and GP130 can directly activate STAT3 [55].
We also assessed the effect of MEK inhibitors on
signal transduction involving the IL6-GP130/JAK/
STAT3 pathway. JAK3 phosphorylation and GP130
were moderately increased. Interestingly, P-JAK2 was
significantly induced in all investigated pancreatic cancer
cell lines (Figure 1C and 1D). Taken together, these results
suggest that JAK2 may be the main upstream kinase
that activates the STAT3 signaling in response to MEK
inhibitors.

Increased STAT3 phosphorylation induced by
MEK inhibition in K-Ras mutant colon cancer
cells

the molecular significance and therapeutic implications
of mutations in the K-Ras pathway, we also assessed the
phosphorylation of ERK and STAT3 after treatment with
those kinases inhibitors. Cancer cell line HCT116 was
treated with trametinib (5μM) alone, or in combination
with one of the following agents: ruxolitinib (2.5μM,
JAK2 inhibitor), tofacitinib (2.5μM, JAK3 inhibitor) or
KX2-391 (2.5μM, Src inhibitor). Under these conditions,
ERK phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of
trametinib (Figure 3). However, STAT3 phosphorylation
was also induced by trametinib along with the MEK
inhibition in the HCT116 cells. Expectedly, increased
STAT3 phosphorylation induced by trametinib was down
regulated by ruxolitinib (JAK2) inhibition, and partially
by tofacitinib (JAK3) inhibition. But the phosphorylation
of STAT3 was not decreased by the inhibition of Src
family kinases in the cell lines (Figure 3A). These results
suggest that the trametinib-induced phosphorylation of
STAT3 may through the JAK2/STAT3 signal transduction
pathway.
We also performed immunoblots to gauge the effects
of a combination of MEK inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor
in the K-Ras mutant HCT116 cell lines (Figure 3B).
When cells were treated with trametinib in combination
with ruxolitinib (JAK2 inhibitor), the trametinib induced
activation of STAT3 was inhibited. Given the promising
response of HCT116 cells to the dual inhibition of the
JAK2/STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways, we further

Trametinib inhibited phosphorylated ERK1/2
(P-ERK1/2) in K-Ras mutant colon cancer cell lines
HCT116 (G13D), LS174T (G12D) and DLD-1 (G13D)
(Figure 2). Surprisingly, trametinib also induced
phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 (P-­STAT3 Y705),
but not P-STAT3 (S727). Trametinib decreased ERK
phosphorylation in K-Ras mutant colon cancer cells,
while it also induced a strong expression of P-JAK2 and a
moderate expression of P-JAK3, the upstream kinases that
phosphorylate STAT3 (HCT116 cells as a representative,
Figure 2C). However we did not observe increases in Src
phosphorylation in K-Ras mutant colon cancer cells. Our
novel results suggest that the activated/phosphorylated
Tyr705 of STAT3 (P­
-STAT3 Y705) promotes cancer
cell survival and causes feed-back resistance to MEK
inhibitors.

JAK2/STAT3 activation is key mediators of
resistance to MEK inhibitors in K-Ras mutant
cells
Activation of STAT3 can be through one of these
kinases, JAK2, JAK3 or the Src family kinases. To explore

Effect of the expression of STAT3 protein on
MEK inhibition

investigated the effects of a combination of the STAT3selective inhibitor LY5 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib
in K-Ras mutant cell lines (Figure 3C). The combined
treatment of LY5 and trametinib also synergistically
inhibited ERK phosphorylation and STAT3 activation
induced by trametinib in the HCT116 cell line. These
findings provide additional evidence for that STAT3
activation in response to MEK inhibition mediates the
antagonistic effects of the MEK inhibitors in K-Ras
mutant colon cells.

To confirm the essential role of the STAT3 pathway
in resistance to MEK inhibition, we knocked down
STAT3 in K-Ras mutant AsPC-1 cell line. In cell viability
assays, knockdown of STAT3 in the AsPC-1 cells resulted
in enhanced sensitivity to AZD6244/trametinib. The
knockdown cell lines, AsPC-1 (STAT3-shRNA), showed
that the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50)
were at least 5-fold lower than their parental cells (AsPC1) and control cells (AsPC-1, vector) (Figure 4). MEK
inhibition had small effects in the parental cells AsPC-1

were treatment with trametinib (5 µM) or combined LY5 for 24 hr, and P-STAT3(Y705), STAT3 and P-ERK1/2 levels were determined by

inhibitors. AsPC-1 cells were infected with shRNA against STAT3 and non-targeted shRNA (Vector). Those cancer cell lines were treated
with trametinib at the indicated dose for 24 hr. The expressions of P-STAT3, P-ERK1/2 and STAT3 were detected on western blots, GAPDH
served as a loading control. IC50 was determined as described in the materials and methods.

Combinational inhibition of MEK and STAT3
pathways in K-Ras mutant pancreatic and colon
cancer cells

and the control AsPC-1(vector), while it had significant
effects on inhibiting cell viability of the AsPC-1(STAT3shRNA) cell lines. These results suggest that activation
of STAT3 stimulated by MEK inhibition is necessary for
cancer cell survival. Therefore, STAT3’s inhibition may
be a potential strategy for overcoming the MEK inhibitor
resistance. We then examined the expression levels and
phosphorylation of STAT3 protein after MEK inhibition.
In control cells AsPC-1 (vector), increasing doses of
trametinib for 24 hours caused a decrease in P-ERK,
but an increase of P-STAT3 (Y705). In AsPC-1 (STAT3shRNA), P-ERK was also inhibited by the treatments
(Figure 4), but no P-STAT3 (Y705) was detected.
To further validate our hypothesis and verify that
the effect of resistance to MEK inhibitors is correlated
to STAT3 activation, we stably express a known
constitutively active STAT3, STAT3-C [31], in cancer
cells. The inhibition of cell viability of AZD6244 in AsPC1 cells was also partially reversed by the transfection with
STAT3-C expression (Figure 5). AsPC-1 (Vector) cells
not transferred with STAT3-C are still relatively sensitive
to AZD6244 inhibition. Our results show that STAT3-C
can at least partially rescue MEK inhibition. These results
provide additional evidence to support that the resistance
to MEK inhibitors is through the induction of endogenous
STAT3 protein in cancer cells. Collectively, knockdown
of STAT3 in AsPC-1 cells significantly sensitized the cells
to AZD6244 and trametinib treatment, and activation of
the STAT3 pathway by the constitutively active STAT3
induced the resistance to AZD6244. These results suggest
that STAT3 pathway activation may play an important role
in developing resistance to MEK inhibitors.

Biochemical feedback loops and cross-talk may
drive primary resistance to MEK-inhibitors [56, 57]. This
provides a rationale for combining MEK-inhibitors with
Raf, PI3K, FGFR or EGFR inhibitors [58]. Since STAT3
signaling is involved in cell survival and drug resistance
[10, 59-61], the undesired STAT3 activation by MEK
inhibitors could potentially introduce resistance to MEK
inhibitors in clinical trials. Therefore, this novel finding
provides a rationale for a combination of MEK inhibitors
and STAT3 pathway modulators to afford more effective
therapy of K-Ras mutant cancer.
Because JAK2 coordinately mediate MEK inhibitors
that induced P-STAT3, this induction was inhibited by
combinational treatment of ruxolitinib or LY5 as detected
by western blot analysis (Figure 3). To examine whether
the resistance can be reversed by JAK2/STAT3 inhibition,
combination of several small molecular inhibitors
were investigated to inhibit both the MEK and STAT3
pathways. AsPC-1 cell viability assays were assessed upon
exposure to the different agents alone and in combination.
As shown in Figure 6A, AsPC-1 cell viability was
remarkably reduced with the combination of MEK
inhibitor (AZD6244) and JAK1/2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib).
In contrast, MEK inhibitor or JAK1/2 inhibitor as a single
agent was not very effective on cancer cell viability.
Similar results were obtained by co-treatment with
trametinib and ruxolitinib (Figure 6A). The synergistic
effects were also obtained by the combined treatment of
LY5 and trametinib in AsPC-1 and Capan-1 cells (Figure
6B). The rationale to choose LY5 in our studies is that LY5
is a potent STAT3-selective small molecular inhibitor. LY5

alone (or knockdown STAT3) did not inhibit P-ERK1/2
but appeared to slightly induce P-ERK1/2 (Figure 4), and
AZD6244 or trametinib alone, as well as the combination
blocked P-ERK1/2. Similar results were observed with
a combination of MEK and STAT3 inhibitors in K-Ras
mutant HCT-116 and LS174T colorectal cancer cells
(Figure 6C), which further support the hypothesis that
inhibiting dual MEK and STAT3 pathways in K-Ras
mutant cells can increase sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

of STAT3 inhibition (ruxolitinib or LY5) and MEK
inhibition, showed a synergistic antitumor effect in K-Ras
mutant cell lines. Therefore, we next sought to investigate
whether combination treatment may also inhibit the colony
formation capability. AsPC-1 cells were treated with
AZD6244, LY5 or the combination of the two for 2 hours.
After the treatment, the same number of viable cancer cells
was seeded at very low cell densities (1000 cells/60mm
dish) and cultured in fresh medium without drugs for 2
weeks. Cells were then fixed and stained and the plates
were scanned. As shown in Figure 7A, the cancer cells
showed a decreased ability to recover and form colonies
following combination treatment with AZD6244 and LY5.
The results demonstrate that the combination treatment
exhibited stronger inhibition of the colony forming ability
than a single agent, and indicate the benefit and rationale
to block both MEK and STAT3 oncogenic pathways in
K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells.

inhibitors enhanced inhibition of cell viability compared
with the treatment of a single agent in all tested cell lines

Cell migration is an important process in tumor
metastasis. In order to assess the effect of a dual inhibition
of MEK and STAT3 pathways on cell migratory ability, a
wound healing assay was performed on HPAC, HCT116
and DLD-1 cells. As shown in Figure 7B, after the creation
of a wound, cells were treated with different inhibitors and
allowed to grow and migrate into the wound for 24 hours.
HPAC cells migrated to fill the scratched area within 24
hours. Treatment with LY5 or trametinib also resulted
in a decreased ability for cells to migrate and heal the
created wound, but the combined treatment of trametinib
and LY5 completely prevented this migration. Consistent
with above result, co-treatment also significantly blocked
HCT116 and DLD-1 cells to migrate through scratched
area (Figure 7C and 7D).

the (S + T) group with a dual inhibition, tumors appeared
to grow slightly at the beginning, but remained essentially
static over the 5 weeks’ treatment. Although trametinibtreated AsPC-1(Vector) xenografts (V + T) impaired tumor
growth, its effect was not stronger than in AsPC-1(STAT3shRNA) xenografts (S + T) mice (Figure 8A and 8B). The
result suggests that MEK or STAT3 signaling pathway
alone is able to maintain proliferation. Inhibiting only one
of the MEK and STAT3 signaling pathways would not be
effective. Therefore, in vivo, a dual inhibition of MEK
and STAT3 signaling pathways would be much more
effective in K-Ras mutant cancer cells. Taken together,
both in vitro and in vivo results suggest that STAT3 plays
a critical role in K-Ras mutant cells in response to agents
inhibiting MEK. We did not observe any statistically
significant changes in body weight of mice used in the
experiments (Figure 8C). Immunoblotting analyses were
done to confirm the mechanisms of action of trametinib.
Interestingly, P-ERK was increased in the knockdown
STAT3 group, which is consistent with what observed in
cell experiments (Figure 8D).

Co-inhibition of the STAT3 and MEK signaling
pathways inhibits the tumor growth of K-Ras
mutant xenograft models
To determine the impact of STAT3 inhibition on
tumor growth in vivo, we subcutaneously injected AsPC1(STAT3-shRNA) and AsPC-1(Vector) cells into nude
mice on either side of the abdomen. Mice were then
treated with trametinib by daily oral gavage. Knockdown
STAT3 (STAT3-shRNA) did not reduce the size of
xenograft tumors compared with AsPC-1(Vector) group.
In contrast, simultaneous inhibition of MEK and STAT3 (S
+ T) significantly reduced tumor growth compared to those
control groups (Figure 8A curve in blue). Interestingly, in

DISCUSSION
Activating K-Ras mutations occur at a frequency
of 90% in pancreatic and 45% in colorectal carcinomas.
Currently, there have been no specific inhibitors for this
oncogene [2]. Efforts to block oncogenic Ras activity
are focused on downstream pathways. Inhibiting the
downstream effector MEK1/2 has proven to be effective
in preclinical and clinical studies in patients with

melanoma, pancreatic, colon and lung cancers. So far,
11 MEK inhibitors have entered clinical trials. Among
them, trametinib has been approved as cancer therapies
[62]. Unfortunately, the clinical success of MEK inhibitors
as single agents has often been limited by toxicity, low
efficacy and drug resistance in K-Ras mutant cancers.
Recently, more evidence has emerged to suggest that
feedback activation of other pathway may limit the
efficacy of MEK inhibitors in K-Ras mutated cancers
[63]. Despite intensive study, the molecular and genetic
mechanisms for drug resistance remain poorly understood.
Preclinical studies have identified distinct mechanisms
by which cells acquire resistance to MEK inhibition,
including amplification of mutant BRAF [64], PI3K
upregulation [23], EGFR activation [54] or mutations in
the allosteric pocket of MEK, which can directly block the
inhibitor binding to the MEK kinase or induce constitutive
MEK kinase activity. Dual inhibition of these pathways
has provided benefit in some patients [65]. In this study,
we identified the JAK2/STAT3 pathway as a key mediator
of the resistance to MEK inhibition in K-Ras mutant
pancreatic and colon cancer cells.
The mechanism of STAT3 activation following
MEK inhibitor treatment appeared complex. We initially
identified that the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT3 mainly at Tyr705 residue.
Since AZD6244 is not approved for cancer therapy, we
then confirmed our observations with the FDA approved
MEK selective inhibitor trametinib, which showed similar
results of activating STAT3 mainly through Tyr705
phosphorylation. In tumors, where STAT3 was implicated
for oncogenesis, activation of STAT3 was found to be
the result of phosphorylation at both Ty705 and Ser727
residues. The role of STAT3 phosphorylation at Ty705 in
tumorigenesis is well established. However, the function
of phosphorylated Ser727 remains controversial at the
moment. Our results indicate that MEK inhibition induced
marked Tyr705 phosphorylation but only a slight Ser727
phosphorylation in the majority of K-Ras mutant cancer
cell lines. The differences we found in Tyr705 and Ser727
phosphorylation of STAT3 are in line with the latter
report [66], supporting the Tyr705 phosphorylation as an
activating factor. The function of Ser727 phosphorylation
may depend on the specific gene and cell type.
We further confirmed that inhibition of the STAT3
pathway by STAT3-specific shRNA or LY5 [67,68]
sensitized K-Ras mutated cancer cells to MEK inhibitor
treatment in vitro and in vivo. In our study, stable cell
lines expressing shRNA constructs against STAT3 in the
K-Ras mutant AsPC-1 cell lines enhanced sensitivity to
AZD6244 and trametinib, and activation of the STAT3
pathway with the constitutively active form of STAT3
induced resistance to AZD6244. Also, inhibiting the
STAT3 pathway by LY5 enhances the ability of MEK
inhibitors to inhibit cancer cell viability. Small molecule
inhibitors that directly inhibit STAT3 are not yet approved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by FDA for therapeutic use. However, compounds that
inhibit upstream effectors of the STAT3 pathway, such as
RTKs, Src and JAKs, are clinically available. Interestingly,
our study shows that inhibiting Src or JAK3 does not
cause extensive cell death compared with inhibiting
STAT3 directly. In contrast, JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib,
significantly suppressed tumor cells viability in the K-Ras
mutant cancer cells, which indicates that JAK2-STAT3
signaling contributes to the drug resistance in this model.
Consistent with our findings, a combination of MEK and
JAK2 inhibitors showed remarkable anti-cancer activity in
these K-Ras mutant cancer cells [69,70].
Our study indicates that inhibition of the single
SAT3 or MEK pathway in the xenograft assay did not
markedly reduce tumor growth, but dual inhibition
of STAT3 and MEK pathways resulted in significant
suppression of tumors, with subsequent slight tumor
growth, and stop growing over the 5 weeks after treatment.
The STAT3 shRNA tumors, however, showed a marked
increase in phosphorylation of ERK after knockdown
STAT3. The results suggested that ERK activation could
compensate with the STAT3 inhibition to maintain
proliferation and survival. This may also explain that
knocking down STAT3 group alone did not reduce the
size of xenograft tumors compared with AsPC-1(Vector)
group.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we explored novel compensatory
mechanisms by which K-Ras mutant cells resist the MEK
inhibitors. Our results provide the new evidence for the
MEK inhibition can increase the expression and activation
of STAT3 in K-Ras mutant pancreatic and colon cancer
cells. Using genetic, functional, and pharmacologic
inhibition, we have demonstrated that dual inhibition of
STAT3 and MEK signaling pathways significantly reduced
viability of pancreatic and colon cancer cells. Our study
not only provides insight into the molecular mechanism
of MEK inhibitor resistance but also suggests a novel
combination therapy of STAT3 and MEK inhibitors could
be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and/or
overcoming resistance of MEK inhibitor in patients with
colorectal and pancreatic cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Selumetinib (AZD6244, MEK inhibitor), trametinib
(GSK1120212, MEK inhibitor), KX2-391 (Src inhibitor)
and tofacitinib (CP-690550, JAK3 inhibitor) were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).
PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) and ruxolitinib (INCB081424,
14482

Oncotarget

JAK1/2 inhibitor) were purchased from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA, USA). LY5 (STAT3 inhibitor [67]) was
synthesized by Chenglong Li’s Lab (College of Pharmacy,
The Ohio State University). The drug compounds were
dissolved in sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a
20 mM stock solution stored at -20˚C.

AsPC-1 cells were plated in 6-well plate and grew to
70 - 90% confluence. Cells were then transfected with
3.0 μg of STAT3-C plasmid using 10 μL Lipofectamine
2000 Reagent in opti-MEM. After overnight transfection,
growth medium was replaced with a fresh complete
DMEM medium with 10% FBS. 48 hours after
transfection, cells were split 1:5~1:50 into single cell.
After 72 hours, transfected cells were placed under
selection with 400µg/ml of G418. Clones from the
transfected cells were isolated and grown under G418.
Colones were confirmed by Western Blotting analysis.
AsPC-1 cells expressing constitutive STAT3 were treated
with AZD6244 (1–25µM) or DMSO. Cell viability was
determined by MTT assay in 96-well plates as described
in this paper.

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, HPAC
and AsPC-1) and human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116,
LS174T and DLD-1) were purchased from ATCC (the
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA).
All above cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.
The Capan-1 cell lines was provided by Dr. Mitch Phelps
(The Ohio State University) and cultured in Iscove’s
Modified Dubecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented
with 20% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell
lines were cultured in a humidified 37 ˚C incubator with
5% CO2. Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic, Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 4.5g/L D-glucose,
L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, OptiMEM reduced
serum medium and Iscove’s Modified Dubecco’s Medium
(IMDM), both containing L-glutamine, were all purchased
from Gibco (Grand Island, NY).

MTT cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
3000 cells per well and cultured for 24 hours. For cell
viability experiment, different concentrations of drugs
were added in triplicate to the plates for 24-72 hours at 37
˚C. 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) viability assay was done according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany). The absorbance was read at 595 nm. Halfmaximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined
using Sigma Plot 9.0 software (Systat Software Inc., San
Jose, CA). Each experiment was repeated 3 times. Data
are given as mean ± SD.

Cell transfection

Western blot analysis

shRNA knockdown: The human STAT3 gene-specific
shRNA plasmid, along with control shRNA plasmids were
purchased from Addgene. Stable clones were prepared
by transfecting AsPC-1 cells in 6-well dishes with 3 μg
of each of the shRNA plasmids, using Lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, in each
well of 6-well plates, 2.0 × 105 AsPC-1 cells were grown
in 2 mL DMEM culture medium without antibiotics to 50
- 70% confluence. Growth medium was replaced with 2
mL of freshly prepared Opti-MEM medium. Cells were
then transfected with 3.0 μg of shRNA plasmid using
10 μL Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent. At 6 hours posttransfection, growth medium was replaced with a fresh
complete DMEM medium with 10% FBS. 72 hours
after transfection, the cells were placed under selection
with 4.0µg/ml of puromycin, splitting 1:5 when the cells
reached confluency. Clones from the transfected cells were
isolated and grown under puromycin. Western blot assay
was used to detect the expression of P-STAT3 and STAT3
in the cells.
STAT3-C transfection: The STAT3-C (a murine
STAT3) was a constitutively active form of STAT3,
which was cloned into vector with a Flag epitope [31].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were harvested after treatment with drugs or
DMSO at 60-80% confluence for 24-72 hours then lysed
in cold RIPA lysis buffer containing a cocktail of protease
inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitor. The lysates were
subjected to 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were incubated with a
1:1000 dilution of specific primary antibody and 1:10000
HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Primary antibodies
including phospho-STAT3 (Tyrosine 705), phosphoSTAT3 (Ser727), STAT3, phospho-AKT (Serine 473),
phospho-ERK1/2 (Threonine 202/Tyrosine 204), phosphoJAK2(Tyr1007/1008), phospho-JAK3 (Tyr980/981),
phospho-Src (Tyrosine 416) and GAPDH, and secondary
antibody are all from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA, USA). Membranes were analyzed using enhanced
chemiluminescence Plus reagents and scanned with
the Storm Scanner (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc,
Piscataway, NJ).

gavage. The first day of drug treatment was termed day
0. The maximum diameter (a) and minimum diameter
(b) of the tumor were measured with a vernier caliper
every 2 days, and at the same time, the behavior, diet, and
weight of nude mice were observed. The tumor volume
(V) was calculated according to the formula: volume =
(π/6) ab2. At the end of treatments, tumors were harvested
from euthanized mice, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored in -80oC. Tumors tissue homogenates were lysed
and separated by SDS-PAGE to examine the expression
of P-ERK and P-STAT3.

Cells were grown to 60–80% confluent in 10 cm
plates and then pre-treated with drugs or DMSO for 2-6
hours. Then the treated cells were trypsinized, stained with
trypan blue and counted. 1000 cells were then seeded in
60 mm plates in duplicate and allowed to grow for 2-3
weeks until the colonies were visible. Cells were washed
with PBS twice and fixed with cold methanol at -20 °C
for 10 min. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet
(25% methanol) at room temperature for 10 min. After
the staining, the plates were washed with distill water and
dried.

Statistical analysis

Cell migration assay (in vitro wound-healing
assay)

Significance of correlations was done using
GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired t tests were used
for analyses assuming Gaussian populations with a 95%
confidence interval. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
Differences were analyzed with the Student t test, and
significance was set at P < 0.05.

HPAC, DLD-1 and HCT-116 cells migration were
detected using the wound-healing assay described by
Xiao et al. [68]. Briefly, when cells grew into confluent
monolayer in plate, we scratched the cells in same width
using yellow tip and washed once to remove non-adherent
cells. After washing, cells treated with LY5 (2µΜ/1µΜ),
trametinib (1μM) or DMSO. Cells were allowed to
migrate into scratched area for 24-72 hours and images
were captured with a microscopic camera system. The
percentage of wound healing was calculated by the
equation: (percent wound healing) = average of [(gap area:
0 hour) − (gap area: 24-72 hours)]/ (gap area: 0 hours)
[68].

Animal studies

CONFLICTS INTEREST

All animal studies were conducted in accordance
with the standard procedures approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the
Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital
(Columbus, OH). The approved protocols were designed
to minimize the numbers of mice used and to minimize
any pain or distress. Mice were acclimatized at the
Animal Facility for 1 week before being injected with
cancer cells. For analysis of tumorigenicity, AsPC1(vector) control or AsPC-1 STAT3 shRNA cells (5×106
cells/mice) were mixed with an equal volume of PBS
and Matrigel (Invitrogen) in a total of 100 μL and were
injected subcutaneously into the flank of 6-week-old,
weighing 20 to 25 g, athymic female nude mice. All
mice were maintained under barrier conditions. After
1 week, tumor mass reaching 6 mm in diameter was
judged as a successful model and mice were randomly
divided into four groups (n=4). Drug treated group of
animals were given MEK inhibitor trametinib 0.30mg/kg/
