BACKGROUND: A carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimen was used as primary postoperative therapy in
infants with central nervous system (CNS) tumors to limit renal and ototoxicity and to target systemic exposure. METHODS: Fifty-three patients aged <age 3 years with embryonal CNS tumor medulloblastoma (n
¼ 20), ependymoma (EP, n ¼ 21), choroid plexus carcinoma (CPCA, n ¼ 5), and primitive embryonal neoplasms including atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n ¼ 7) were treated with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. Radiation therapy was used only for residual disease at the end of chemotherapy or
disease progression. RESULTS: The response rate after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was 34% (complete
response, 13.8%; partial response, 20.7%). Myelosuppression was the dominant toxicity; 2 patients had toxic
deaths related to thrombocytopenia with trauma. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 49%  7%, and the
progression-free survival (PFS) was 31%  7%, with a median follow-up of 11.4 years (range, 5.2-15.0 years).
For medulloblastoma, the 5-year PFS was 26%  9%; for EP it was 33%  10%; for CPCA it was 80%  18%;
and for primitive neuroectodermal and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors it was 0%. Localized EP patients
with gross total resection who did not undergo radiotherapy had a 5-year PFS of 57%  17% and OS of 71%
 16%. Two patients developed late second malignancies; 1 was associated with germline p53 mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that carboplatin has similar activity to cisplatin in otherwise similar
regimens. Five-year survival data are comparable to those reported in other recent studies, including highdose chemotherapy studies. Of note is the marked activity in CPCA and gross totally resected EP. Cancer

population.7-20 Although Duffner et al. demonstrated
that cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens led to objective response rates of 40% overall, the median time-toprogression was only 6 months to 9 months.1 More recent
studies have demonstrated that certain subgroups of
patients have been cured by postoperative cisplatin-based
chemotherapy alone.4,5 Grill et al. reported the feasibility
of chemotherapy alone in younger patients with ependymomas (EPs)5 and medulloblastomas (MBs),4 with 4year progression-free survival (PFS) for EP of 22%, and 5year PFS for gross totally resected M0 MB of 29% (confidence interval, 18%-44%). Geyer et al. demonstrated that
a more intensive chemotherapy regimen led to avoidance
of radiation therapy (RT) in 58% of MB patients, with a
5-year overall survival (OS) and PFS of 43%  3% and
27%  3%, respectively.2 Finally, Rutkowski et al.
reported that among M0 MB patients, dose-intense
chemotherapy with intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate led to 5-year PFS and OS of 68%  8% and 77%
 8%, respectively.3
Here, we report results of a phase II study of a carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimen and its effects on
response and survival in infants and young children with
CNS tumors. This regimen differs from some other published reports with respect to the use of carboplatin
instead of cisplatin in otherwise similar combination regimens with the use of 99Tc plasma clearance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between May 1992 and April 1996, 54 children with primary intracranial CNS tumors were treated in a collaborative, limited-institution study. Eligibility included
children being of age <3 years at diagnosis, with histological confirmation of MB, primitive neuroectodermal
tumors (PNET), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, choroid plexus carcinoma (CPCA), or EP. Patients were
required to have an estimated life expectancy of at least 8
weeks, as well as normal hepatic and renal function for
their age. The parents of all patients signed a document of
informed consent consistent with institutional and federal
guidelines, which outlined the investigational nature of
the treatment.
Surgical resection was carried out with the intent of
maximal safe resection. The extent of resection was
defined as: gross total resection (GTR), resection of all
3244

visible tumor confirmed by postoperative neuroimaging;
near total resection, less than total but >90% resection;
subtotal resection, <90% but >50% resection; biopsy,
<50% resection. All patients had the extent of resection
confirmed with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which were generally obtained within
the first 72 hours of surgery. Postoperative neuraxis evaluation included lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology
and spinal MRI, generally done within 10-14 days of surgery, followed by the assignment of Chang M stage.21

Chemotherapy
The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m2 along with mesna on Day 1, and carboplatin at a dose targeted to produce a systemic exposure
(area under the curve) of 6.5 on Day 2, based on 99Tc renal clearance measurements of glomerular filtration rate,
as previously described22; etoposide (VP-16) 100 mg/m2
was given intravenously on Days 1 and 2, after cyclophosphamide and carboplatin. Granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (5 lg/kg) was given for 10-14 days starting on
Day 3. Each cycle was 3 weeks in duration. The total
scheduled duration of therapy was 16 cycles. Delays in
administration beyond Day 28 or grade 4 hematological
toxicity (defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500/
mm3 or platelet count of <25,000/mm3) led to an initial
20% reduction in the cyclophosphamide dose; the second
dose of VP-16 was eliminated in patients with persistent
myelotoxicity. Carboplatin doses were reduced only if
previously described dose modifications were insufficient
to avoid grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Toxicities were
graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria,
version 1.
Therapy was held if serum creatinine was greater
than twice the pretreatment level. Once the serum creatinine was less than twice the pretreatment level, 99Tc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) plasma clearance
was repeated, and the carboplatin dose was recalculated.
Blood counts, chemistries, renal (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and 99Tc DTPA plasma clearance), and
audiological evaluations were performed regularly. MRI
of brain was performed after cycles 2 and 4 and thereafter
every 4 courses until completion of therapy, every 3
months for during year 2, every 4 months during years 3
and 4, and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with

initially positive neuraxis staging had spinal MRI and
CSF cytology at the same intervals. Patients whose neuraxis staging was negative initially, had spinal MRIs performed after cycle 8 of chemotherapy, at completion of
scheduled chemotherapy, and every 6 months for the first
18 months after completion of therapy.
Response was determined at the completion of 2
cycles of chemotherapy by comparing the product of the
largest 2 cross-sectional diameters of the tumor before and
after chemotherapy. A complete response (CR) was
defined as the disappearance of all tumors. A partial
response (PR) was defined as at least a 50% decrease in tumor size. Patients with a <50% change in size were considered to have stable disease (SD). Progressive disease
(PD) was defined as an increase of >25% in size or the
appearance of any new lesion. For patients with >1 evaluable site of disease, overall response was determined by the
site showing the least response. Thus, patients with an
objective response at either the primary or metastatic site
and disease progression at the remaining site were considered to have disease progression overall.

Radiation Therapy
RT was planned only for those patients with neuraxis dissemination at diagnosis, those with residual disease at the
completion of chemotherapy, those who discontinued
chemotherapy early (<12 cycles) as a result of toxicity, or
those with disease progression. In the above groups, RT
was to start as soon as possible after allowing for appropriate treatment planning. The RT dose and volume were
adjusted according to age, diagnosis, and extent of disease
(as indicated below). All patients with M0 disease received
conventional fractionation (CF) at 150-160 centigrays
(cGy)/day. Patients with M þ disease received hyperfractionated (HF) schedules using 110 cGy twice daily with a
6-hour interfraction interval. Patients with EP were given
CF posterior fossa RT only: 48 Gy, 51 Gy, or 54 Gy,
respectively, for ages <18 months, 18-30 months, or >30
months at the time RT was given. Patients with MB,
CPCA, or PNET were treated with craniospinal RT to
doses of 27 Gy CF (35.2 Gy HF for Mþ), 30 Gy CF
(40.7 Gy HF for Mþ), or 34.5 Gy CF (48.4 Gy HF for
Mþ), respectively, for ages <18 months, 18-30 months,
or >30 months at the time RT was given. Subsequent

volume plus 2-cm margins delivered a total of 48 Gy CF
(55 Gy HF for Mþ), 51 Gy CF (60.5 Gy HF for Mþ), or
54 Gy CF (66 Gy HF for Mþ), respectively, based upon
the age criteria noted above.

Statistical Considerations
OS was measured from the date entered into the study to
death from any cause or last date of contact. PFS was
measured from the date entered into the study to the date
of disease progression, death because of tumor, or last
contact. Five patients were censored at the dates of second
malignancy (n ¼ 2) and death because of hematological
toxicity (n ¼ 2) or death unrelated to tumor progression
or toxicity (cause unknown, n ¼ 1) with respect to PFS,
but are considered failures at these dates in the estimate of
event-free survival (EFS). Distributions of PFS, EFS, and
OS were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.23
Standard errors for the Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated by the method proposed by Peto and coworkers.24
Analyses of the relationships between clinical and treatment factors versus outcome were performed using the
log-rank test or the exact log-rank test when the number
of failures was small. Exact tests were performed using
StatXact (Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge,
Mass). Survival estimates are based on follow-up observations as of October 2007.

RESULTS
Tumor Histology, Disease Extent and
Degree of Resection
One patient who, on central pathology review, had a diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma was declared ineligible.
Among the 53 eligible patients, the concordance between
institutional diagnosis and central review diagnosis was
100%. There were 29 males and 24 females with a median
age of 2.15 years (range, 0.18-3.97 years).
Table 1 outlines the initial tumor location, M stage,
and extent of resection by tumor category of the 53 eligible patients. There were 20 patients with MB; 21 with
EP; 5 with CPCA; and 7 with other primitive embryonal
neoplasms (3 supratentorial primitive neuroepithelial
tumors, 1 medulloepithelioma, 2 pineoblastoma, 1 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor). Neuraxis staging was

for extent of resection.
Response to Chemotherapy
Among the 53 eligible patients, 30 patients had measurable disease. One patient withdrew consent before completion of the first 2 courses of chemotherapy and is not
evaluable for response. Thus, 29 patients with measurable
disease were assessable for response after completing 2
cycles of chemotherapy. The overall objective response
rate (CR þ PR) in these 29 patients was 34% (CR,
13.8%; PR, 20.7%); 62.1% experienced SD and 3.4%
3246

PD. Among 23 GTR/M0 patients, 22 remained in complete and continuous remission (CCR) after 2 cycles of
chemotherapy, and 1 patient experienced PD after 2
cycles. Table 2 shows the responses among the various tumor subgroups. Among patients evaluable for response,
15 patients received 12 cycles of chemotherapy with at
least SD. An additional 14 completed <12 cycles free of
progression.

Table 3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet counts
<25  103/mm3) was the most common event,
followed by neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count
<500/mm3). Among these 53 patients, 8 stopped
chemotherapy early because of hematologic toxicity
after a median of 10 cycles (range, 3-11 cycles). There
were 2 toxic deaths; both were intracranial hemorrhages associated with trauma during periods of
thrombocytopenia.

Nonhematologic toxicities were infrequent. Allergic
reactions to carboplatin were observed in 4 patients, and
only 1 patient had a >20% increase in creatinine from pretreatment baseline. Ototoxicity was uncommon; 3 patients
experienced grade 3 ototoxicity after 8-12 courses of therapy. Cyclophosphamide-related grade 1 hematuria was
observed in 1 patient twice during course 12 of therapy.

Use of RT and Subsequent Outcome

completed at least 12 cycles of chemotherapy in CR or
CCR and thus did not receive consolidative x-ray therapy
(XRT) per protocol. Six patients did not complete chemotherapy because of noncompliance (n ¼ 4) and toxic
death (n ¼ 2). Hence, 38 patients were potentially eligible
for protocol-directed or salvage RT for the following reasons: completing at least 12 cycles of chemotherapy with
PR or SD (n ¼ 6), experiencing progression before completing chemotherapy (n ¼ 24), or early termination of
chemotherapy because of toxicity (n ¼ 8). Eighteen
received RT and 20 did not because of parental (n ¼ 18)
or physician (n ¼ 2) preference.
Among the 9 patients completing at least 12 cycles
of chemotherapy in CR or CCR, 5 (50%) remained in
CCR at a median of 12.4 years (range, 5.2-13.7 years)
from study entry; 3 had PD at a median of 1.7 years
(range, 1.2-4.7 years), and 1 patient developed a second
malignancy at 6.2 years from study entry.
Six patients completed at least 12 cycles of chemotherapy with PR or SD. Although all were to receive consolidative RT according to protocol, only 1 did and
remained progression-free until developing a second
malignancy at 2 years from study entry. Four of 5 who did
not receive consolidative RT had PD at a median time of
1.8 years (range, 1.3-2.1 years) from study entry, and 1
remained progression free at 10.2 years. Among the 4
patients who had PD, 3 received salvage RT, and 1 also
underwent high-dose chemotherapy; all 4 remained alive
at last follow-up without subsequent progression of their
disease.
Twenty-four patients experienced PD before completing chemotherapy (median number of courses, 7;
range, 1-13). Twelve received scheduled salvage RT, and
6 remained free of subsequent progression with a 4-year
second PFS of 42%  13%. Among the 12 who did not
receive RT, all patients progressed or died within 2 years
of study enrollment.
Fourteen patients had early termination of chemotherapy because of toxicity (n ¼ 8), noncompliance (n ¼
4), or toxic deaths (n ¼ 2). Of the 8 with toxicity (median
number of cycles, 10; range, 3-11), 5 patients received
consolidative RT, and 3 of these (MB [n ¼ 2], ependymoma [n ¼ 1]) remained failure free at 10.3, 11.2, and
14.8 years from study entry. Two of the 5 patients progressed at 1.4 and 2.1 years from study entry. Three
patients with toxicity-related early termination of chemo3248

therapy did not receive consolidative RT, and all have
died, at 2.0, 3.9, and 9.6 years from study enrollment.
Two patients with Mþ disease at diagnosis completed chemotherapy free of progression (MB n ¼ 1,
CPCA n ¼ 1). The patient with CPCA died of a second
malignancy free of her original tumor. The remaining
patient did not receive adjuvant XRT and remains alive at
15.6 years from study enrollment.

Survival and Prognostic Factors
For the 24 patients who remain alive, the median followup from diagnosis is 11.4 years (range, 5.2-15.0 years).
Table 4 lists the 5-year survival data for all patient groups
in the current study as well as other recent studies. The 5year OS and PFS (standard error) for the entire group of
53 patients are 49%  7% and 31%  7%, respectively.
The 5-year PFS for histological subgroups is shown in
Figure 2.
Among the 6 M0 MB patients with a GTR, PFS
and OS at 5 years were 40%  18% and 33%  16%,
respectively. As specified in the protocol, 2 patients who
completed chemotherapy without progression did not
receive RT, and both remain disease-free. Three others
progressed on chemotherapy, underwent salvage RT, and
died of their disease. One patient had a toxic death (head
trauma and thrombocytopenia). Among all M0 patients
with MB, regardless of extent of resection, 5-year EFS,
PFS, and OS were 33%  14%, 38%  15%, and 44%
 15%, respectively.
Among the 9 M0 ependymoma patients who underwent GTR, EFS, PFS, and OS at 5 years were 56% 
15%, 56%  15%, and 78%  13%, respectively. Five
patients completed chemotherapy and did not receive
RT; 4 remain disease-free at last follow-up, and 1 patient
died of a second malignancy without recurrence of his ependymoma. Among the 4 remaining M0 GTR ependymoma patients, 2 received RT after early termination of
chemotherapy because of toxicity; 1 of the 2 progressed
1.8 years after local RT and underwent radiosurgery; both
patients were disease-free long term (11.2 years and 14.5
years from diagnosis); 2 others experienced disease progression with chemotherapy, but were successfully salvaged with RT, with 1 surviving at 13.8 years from
diagnosis and 1 dying from disease at 3.9 years from
diagnosis.

their disease before receiving RT and were evaluable for
patterns of failure during or after the completion of chemotherapy. Among this group, 10 (71%; 4 MB, 6 EP),

including 4 who were initially Mþ, had recurrences only
at their primary tumor site. Four (29%; 3 MB, 1 EP) had
both local and distant recurrences, 3 of whom were initially free of distant disease. Of note, no initially M0
patient had an isolated distant recurrence.
One patient with M3 MB received 12 courses of
chemotherapy before experiencing PD, then underwent
radiotherapy at 5 years of age (5450 cGy locally and 3520
craniospinal irradiation [CSI]) and developed multiple
radiotherapy-related complications, 6 years after coming
off study. These included transient ischemic episodes, a
cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, and
esophageal strictures requiring regular esophageal
dilatations.
Two patients developed second malignancies. One
patient with CPCA developed treatment-related

DISCUSSION
This report documents 1 of the longest clinical follow-up
periods for any published contemporary prospective primary chemotherapy regimen for CNS tumors in infants
and young children.1-6,25,26 The median follow-up time
in the current series is 11.4 years, compared with a range
of 5.2 to 15.0 years for the other series.
Alkylating and platinating agents such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin have remained the backbone of
most infant CNS tumor chemotherapy regimens. Previous data from this institution have demonstrated that carboplatin and cisplatin are similar with respect to disease
response and survival rates among newly diagnosed
patients with embryonal tumors.27 Geyer et al.2 have also
3250

demonstrated similar response rates to induction therapy
in young children with malignant brain tumors randomized to receive either carboplatin or cisplatin-based therapy. Moreover, the carboplatin-based maintenance
regimen in the study by Geyer et al. led to EFS, similar to
previously reported results of cisplatin-containing
regimens.2
The clinical features (male:female ratio, age, %
GTR, % Mþ) of the current study cohort are similar to
other recent infant CNS tumor studies, with the exception
of the report by Chi et al.,6 which included patients up to
10 years of age at diagnosis, leading to a greater median
age (38 months) than present in other studies.
OS of patients with PNET was significantly worse
compared with EP (P ¼ .005), MB (P ¼ .064), and
CPCA (P ¼ .02). Similarly, nonmetastatic EP (P ¼ .06)
had better PFS and OS than those with other histologies.
Table 2 details the response rates in the current
study compared with those of other recent series. With
the exception of poorer response rates in ependymoma in
this series, the objective response rates among patients
with similar tumor types are similar to other recent studies. Although Chi et al. reported a 91% response rate in
patients with MB, it is important to note that the intensity

of treatment (conventional chemotherapy including
methotrexate plus high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue) and greater age of the patients (57%
of patients were >3 years of age) are substantially different
from this and the other series listed.6
Comparison of the 5-year PFS for the various tumor
groups in the current study to those of other recent studies
(Table 4) demonstrates substantial overlap. For patients
with MB, the 5-year PFS of 26%  9% in the current
report is similar to most other series. Rutkowski et al’s
study reporting a 5-year PFS of 58%  9% represents the
best results reported in the literature for patients with
MB.3 With respect to the better risk M0, GTR MB
patients, those in the current series who completed chemotherapy and did not receive irradiation had a 5-year PFS
of 40  18% (EFS of 33  16%). This result is similar to
all but Rutkowski et al., who reported a PFS of 68  8%
and Dhall et al. who reported a 5-year EFS of 64 
13%.28 Of note, the Rutkowski series also used a carboplatin-based regimen, but added intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate.3 Despite the encouraging PFS in
that report, 82% of the group demonstrated neuroimaging evidence of leukoencephalopathy even without the use
of radiation therapy. The neuropsychologic function of
both groups was diminished, although the decrement was
greater in the irradiated group. This raises concern over
the ‘‘functional efficacy’’ of this approach.
For patients with ependymoma, the 5-year PFS of
33%  10% is very similar to that of the other reported
studies in Table 4 (5-year PFS range, 27%  8.4% to
32%  6%). Among patients with M0 GTR ependymoma who completed chemotherapy without being irradiated, the 5-year PFS was 57%  17%, similar to other
reports.4,29
Although the numbers are small, the 80% 
17% 5-year PFS for the 5 patients with CPCA was
excellent. All had GTR. One patient with Mþ disease
had eventual CR to chemotherapy and survived progression-free for 19 months, but developed a second
malignancy. None of the other 4 surviving CPCA
patients received RT. These data suggest that the current study may improve the outcome of CPCA,3,4
although in M0 patients with GTR other reports show
50% to 80% PFS after surgery alone.30,31

reports2-5,29 that suggest chemotherapy alone is curative

for some subgroups of infants and young children with
CNS tumors. Our results compare favorably to those of
other regimens with respect to outcome. We also confirm
earlier reports that RT is capable of salvaging a proportion
of patients with recurrent tumor after chemotherapy.17,25,26 The 5-year freedom from secondary progression is 48% overall; 58% in the ependymoma group and
38% in the MB group. However, this observation must be
viewed within the context of unacceptably poor neuropsychologic function after CSI RT.17
OS and PFS of most patient groups differed little
between 2 and 5 years postdiagnosis in this and other
studies; there were few relapses beyond 2 years postdiagnosis. These data suggest that extending the duration of
conventional chemotherapy regimens beyond 12 cycles
may not significantly alter outcome.2,30,31 The patterns of
failure in this and other studies are quite similar, dominated by local and local þ distant events; isolated distant
events are uncommon. The above suggests that better and
earlier local control is necessary, perhaps the use of early
local conformal XRT may limit the local and local þ distant relapse rates with acceptable toxicity.
The major toxicity of the current regimen was myelosuppression. Hematologic toxicity was similar to that of
other regimens.1,2 Only 5 (11%) patients treated with the
current carboplatin-based regimen had grade 3 hearing loss,
in contrast to 34% and 25%, respectively, in the cisplatinbased regimens reported by Mason et al.32 and Duffner et
al.1 Similar to Geyer et al’s results in the carboplatin-induction arm,2 only 2% of patients in the current study had clinically significant changes in renal function. Two (4%) toxic
deaths, secondary to head trauma associated with thrombocytopenia, were reported in the current series, compared
with 17 (8%) toxic deaths in Geyer’s more dose-intense carboplatin-based regimen.2 Overall, the combined toxicities
associated with the current regimen compare quite favorably
with those reported for other regimens.
This study confirms that a moderately dose-intense
carboplatin-based regimen is associated with response and
outcome similar to those reported for cisplatin-containing
regimens in MB, EP, and CPCA, and lacks significant
ototoxicity or renal toxicity. These results are bolstered by
the long duration of follow-up and similar results reported
by Geyer et al.,2 demonstrating equal efficacy and more
acceptable toxicity for carboplatin versus cisplatin-based
regimens.
