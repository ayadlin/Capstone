Development Attenuates Bone Destruction and
Increases Limb Use

Abstract
Studies in animals and humans show that blockade of nerve growth factor (NGF) attenuates both
malignant and nonmalignant skeletal pain. While reduction of pain is important, a largely unanswered
question is what other beneﬁts NGF blockade might confer in patients with bone cancer. Using a mouse graft
model of bone sarcoma, we demonstrate that early treatment with an NGF antibody reduced tumor-induced
bone destruction, delayed time to bone fracture, and increased the use of the tumor-bearing limb. Consistent
with animal studies in osteoarthritis and head and neck cancer, early blockade of NGF reduced weight loss in
mice with bone sarcoma. In terms of the extent and time course of pain relief, NGF blockade also reduced
pain 40% to 70%, depending on the metric assessed. Importantly, this analgesic effect was maintained even in
animals with late-stage disease. Our results suggest that NGF blockade immediately upon detection of tumor
metastasis to bone may help preserve the integrity and use, delay the time to tumor-induced bone fracture,
and maintain body weight. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7014–23. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer in bone tissue is typically the result of tumor
metastases from a distant site, and cancers having the highest
prevalence of bone metastases (lung, prostate, and breast) are
the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide (1, 2). In the
United States, in 2013, the estimated number of new cases of
cancer in the lung (228,190), prostate (238,590), and breast
(234,580; ref. 3), combined with the known prevalence of bone
metastasis in lung, prostate, and breast cancer (<36%, <90%,
65%–75%, respectively; ref. 4), results in the estimate that
460,000 new cases of bone metastases will be diagnosed. Once
cancer metastasis to bone (CMB) occurs, it is usually incurable
(unless the metastases are limited to very few sites). However,
advances in cancer treatments continue to dramatically
increase survival rates, thus patients with metastatic disease
and suffering with malignant skeletal pain are living years to
decades beyond their initial cancer diagnosis. Maintenance of
the functional status of patients with CMB requires proactive
management as CMB can cause excruciating bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord and nerve compression synDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Arizona College of Medicine,

dromes, weight loss, derangements of calcium and phosphate
homeostasis, and decline in the ability to load and use tumorbearing bones cannot be viewed individually but rather as
interactive events ultimately contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, and diminished quality of life (2, 5).
In the past decade, progress has been made in understanding what drives CMB. Bisphosphonates and the RANK ligand
inhibitor, denosumab, have been approved for treatment of
both pain and preventing bone fracture (6, 7). A therapy
showing promise in blocking pain induced by CMB and
nonmalignant skeletal pain is inhibition of nerve growth factor
(NGF) and its primary receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor type 1
(TrkA; refs. 8–10). In breast, sarcoma, and prostate mouse
models of CMB, anti-NGF signiﬁcantly attenuates bone cancer
pain (11–15). In addition, in humans, anti-NGF attenuates
moderate-to-severe skeletal pain due to osteoarthritis or low
back pain (16, 17). While animal and human studies suggest
that blockade of NGF/TrkA effectively alleviates malignant and
nonmalignant skeletal pain, most efforts at developing novel
therapies to block or sequester NGF or TrkA were not initially
developed to treat skeletal pain but rather to block/attenuate
tumor growth and metastasis. Extensive in vitro studies show
that NGF and/or TrkA drive the growth and metastasis
of breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and prostate tumor cells
(18–20). Moreover, in vivo studies show that anti-NGF inhibits
ethylnitrosourea-induced carcinogenesis in mice and rats
(21), and either anti-NGF or siRNA against NGF inhibits breast
cancer tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft
model (22).
In the current study, we directly address these CMB patient
issues by using a primarily osteolytic model of bone cancer

that drives tumor-induced bone loss, bone fracture, loss of the
use of the tumor-bearing limb, and weight loss. We explore
whether early administration of anti-NGF can attenuate these
pathologic features. In addition, we have modiﬁed and reﬁned
our bone disease progression and behavioral end points to
more closely mirror end points used in human clinical studies
in patients with CMB.

Materials and Methods
Surgical procedures and drug treatment
Mice. Experiments were conducted with adult C3H/HeJ
mice (Jackson Laboratories) approximately 4- to 8-week-old,
weighing 25 to 30 g at time of tumor cell injection. Mice were
housed in accordance with NIH guidelines under speciﬁc
pathogen-free conditions in autoclaved cages maintained at
22 C with a 12-hour alternating light/dark cycle and access to
food and water ad libitum. All procedures adhered to the
guidelines of the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues
of the International Association for the Study of Pain (23) and
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ). Experiments were initiated with 90 mice, out of which a total of 85
mice were included for data analyses: na€ve (n ¼ 8), sham
surgery (n ¼ 13), NCTC 2472 (femur-injected) þ vehicle (n ¼
36), NCTC 2472 (femur injected) þ anti-NGF (n ¼ 24), NCTC
2472 þ vehicle (muscle-injected; n ¼ 4). To allow for careful
attention to both surgical treatments and behavioral pain
assessments/analyses, each experiment typically involved 12
to 16 mice, comprising of different experimental groups.
Cells. NCTC 2472 cells (ATCC CCL-11, ATCC), derived
from a culture of subcutaneous areolar and adipose connective tissue (taken from a normal 82-day-old male C3H/HeJ
mouse), aggressively stimulate osteoclast activity upon intramedullary femoral injection, and produce a bone histopathology resembling that found in human osteolytic bone
cancer (24, 25). Authentication/testing carried out by ATCC
conﬁrmed the post-freeze viability, growth properties, morphology, absence of mycoplasma, species, sterility, and development of sarcomas upon injection into mice. NCTC 2472
cells were stably transfected to express GFP to enable visualization. In vitro and in vivo tumor cell characteristics of
GFP-transfected NCTC 2472 cells (growth rate, bone resorption rate, induction of bone cancer-related pain), were temporally, behaviorally, and physically identical to that of nontransfected NCTC 2472 cells (26). Upon thaw, GFP-transfected
NCTC 2472 cells were cultured according to ATCC recommendations, passaged for at least three, but not more than
20 passages (less than 3 months), and veriﬁed mycoplasma-free
before injection into mice. Additional information is included in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Surgery. Injection of NCTC 2472 cells directly into the
intramedullary space of the mouse femur was done as previously described (13, 27–33). To prevent the patella from
becoming displaced postarthrotomy, muscles were secured
back in position using a horizontal mattress suture. In addition, after surgery, animals were individually housed and
allowed to recover for one week before being handled for

behavioral and radiologic assessment. Additional information
included in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Anti-NGF treatment. The anti-NGF sequestering antibody (mAb911), kindly provided by Dr. David Shelton
(Rinat/Pﬁzer), blocks the binding of NGF to both TrkA (tyrosine kinase receptor type 1, NTRK1) and p75 (neurotrophin
receptor, LNGFR), and inhibits TrkA autophosphorylation (34).
Anti-NGF has no effect on healthy bone (11–14, 35–37), its
plasma half-life is 5 to 6 days in the mouse, and it does not
appreciably cross the blood–brain barrier (38). In this study,
the dose used (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was based on previous studies
(11), and it was delivered starting at day 7 after cancer cell
injection, and every 5 days thereafter.
Assessment of bone cancer disease progression and pain
Mice were assessed for bone cancer disease progression,
functional status, and both spontaneous and movementevoked pain, to measure end points that are clinically relevant
to the patient with bone cancer (2, 9). Behavioral testing was
performed on the same days as radiologic assessment to enable
comparison between pain behavior and bone destruction.
Each method of behavioral assessment was performed by the
same experimenter who was blinded to the drug treatments.
Radiology. High resolution X-ray images of cancer or
vehicle-injected femurs were obtained several days before
surgery (baseline), and immediately following weekly behavioral assessments, using a Faxitron MX-20 digital cabinet X-ray
system (Faxitron/Bioptics). Mice were lightly anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine (0.005 mL/g, 50 mg/10 kg, s.c.) to
enable consistent placement of the animal for radiologic
assessment. Faxitron settings were optimized for radiologic
assessment of cortical or trabecular bone destruction. Animals
were excluded from the study if a patella displacement was
identiﬁed through radiography (see Supplementary Material
and Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1).
Bone scoring. To quantify the extent of bone destruction,
and to separately analyze disease progression at the distal and
proximal aspects of tumor-bearing femora, a 10-point bone
scoring method was used, in which the distal and proximal
halves of each femur were scored separately on a previously
validated scale of 0 to 5 (28, 33), and then the scores for each
femur half were summed (maximum possible score of 10). For
each femoral aspect, bone scores were deﬁned as: 0, normal
bone with no signs of destruction; 1, small pits (1–3 in number)
of bone destruction; 2, increased pitted appearance (4–6 in
number) and loss of medullary bone; 3, loss of medullary bone
and erosion of cortical bone; 4, full thickness unicortical bone
loss; and 5, full thickness bicortical bone loss and displaced
skeletal fracture (Fig. 1).
Time-to-fracture. The radiographic endpoint "time-tofracture" was deﬁned as the time (day) after surgery when a
fracture was identiﬁed through radiography.
Spontaneous nocifensive behavior. Mice were placed in
small raised Plexiglas chambers (11.5  6.8  7.5 cm) with a
wire grid ﬂoor, acclimated for 30 minutes (until cage exploration and major grooming activities ceased), and then their
movements were videotaped from below using Sony Handycam DCR-SR68 cameras. Time spent in "nocifensive" behavior

Figure 1. Sarcoma-induced bone destruction. High-resolution
radiographs of the mouse femur illustrate progressive bone destruction
following intramedullary injection of sarcoma cells. To measure the extent
of bone destruction, each femur was divided into two equal-length
aspects (distal and proximal), and bone destruction scores for each
aspect were separately determined. For each femoral aspect,
radiographs were scored on a 0–5 scale: 0 (normal), no signs of bone
destruction; 1 (mild), small pits (1–3 in number) of bone destruction; 2
(moderate), increased pitted appearance (4–6 in number) and loss of
medullary bone; 3 (severe), loss of medullary bone and erosion of cortical

was assessed during a 5-minute observation period (between
minutes 15–20 of the ﬁlmed behavior). Nocifensive behavior
was deﬁned as: (i) full guarding (lifting the affected limb and
holding it against its body), (ii) reduced weight-bearing (affected limb is not completely held up against its body and some
weight is borne on it), (iii) tending to the affected limb
(abnormal grooming behavior directed solely to affected limb),
and (iv) sporadic hopping (intermittent jumps without utilizing affected limb). See Supplementary Material and Methods
for additional information, including videos of mice showing
different types of spontaneous nocifensive behavior.
Limb use (movement-evoked pain). Limb use in an open
ﬁeld was assessed as previously described (28). The mouse was
placed in the middle of a large Plexiglas box (40  50  20 cm)
containing a mirror on the end facing the observer (for
increased visibility of limb use), and observed while walking/running in a continuous motion over a 2-minute period.
Movements were categorized as follows: limping, guarding,
ﬂinching, nonuse of limb, hunched posture, slow-to-get-upand-go, walking slow, stiff/uneven gait, tilted stance, splayed
limb, dragging of toes, and refusal to move. Movement of the
affected limb was rated on the following scale: 0 ¼ normal
walking, þ1 point assigned for each additional type of abnormal movement or posture observed (up to a total of 12).
Dynamic weight bearing. The percentage of weight borne
by each limb of a freely moving animal was measured using a
ﬂoor-instrumented dynamic weight bearing system (DWB,
BioSeb EB Instruments). Data are presented as percent weight

Signiﬁcance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Characterization of bone cancer pain model
Experimental investigation in our optimized model involved ﬁrst baseline behavioral assessment and X-ray analysis
of na€ve mice, followed by selection of animals with comparable values and their random assignment to treatment
groups (vehicle or therapy). To monitor disease progression,
high-resolution radiographs of the mouse femur were taken
at various time points after surgery. Radiologic evidence of
bone destruction presents as radiolucent areas, typically
observed in the distal and proximal aspects of the femur at
early time points of disease progression. As time and disease
progress, multiple focal radiolucencies are accompanied by
loss of medullary bone, erosion of cortical bone, and ultimately, fracture (Fig. 1).
At day 0 (surgery), arthrotomies were performed, alternately
between vehicle- and therapy-designated mice. Postsurgical
pain, as exhibited by sham [Hank's balanced salt solution
(HBSS)-injected] mice, typically peaked at day 3 after the
arthrotomy, and approached baseline values by day 7 after
surgery (Fig. 2). Spontaneous nocifensive behavior exhibited by
NCTC 2472-injected mice was temporally differentiated into
"surgical pain" and "bone cancer pain." Postsurgical pain in
NCTC 2472-injected mice was similar to that experienced by
sham mice, peaking at day 3 after surgery and signiﬁcantly
lessened by day 5 after surgery. However, at day 7 after surgery,
the observed proﬁles of nocifensive behavior for HBSS- and
NCTC 2472-injected mice typically started to diverge, with
tumor-bearing mice increasing in nocifensive behavior with
time. At days 10 and 14 after surgery, nocifensive behavior
exhibited by cancer cell–injected mice was approximately 3
and 6 times that of day 7 after surgery, respectively, and this
rapid rise in cancer-induced bone pain extended to day 18 after
surgery, at which time it was approximately 8-fold higher than
that at day 7 after surgery. After day 18 after surgery, nocifensive behavior in NCTC 2472-injected mice steadily increased,
although at a less rapid pace, and was approximately ten times
that of day 7 after surgery at the end of the study (day 30).
Collectively, these data demonstrated that our bone cancer

To demonstrate the importance of location of cancer cell

our study a group of "muscle-injected" animals wherein NCTC
2472 cells were injected directly into the muscle adjacent to the
femur. Despite the development of large tumor volumes,
"muscle-injected" animals did not exhibit nocifensive behavior

To determine the effect of anti-NGF on NCTC 2472-induced
bone destruction, mice were administered injections of either
vehicle (PBS) or anti-NGF in PBS (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Anti-NGF
therapy was initiated at day 7 after surgery, and repeated every
5 days. At days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after cancer cell injection,
mouse femurs were radiologically assessed for evidence of
bone destruction. At day 7, before the administration of the
ﬁrst dose of anti-NGF, minimal bone destruction was observed
for both treatment groups. By day 21 (after three doses of antiNGF), a signiﬁcant decrease in bone destruction was achieved
with anti–NGF-treated animals, and continued through day 28

but not involving the bone) is the critical factor in the intensity of bone cancer pain, experiments were performed in which murine NCTC 2472 sarcoma-producing
cells were injected either directly into the intramedullary space of the mouse femur or into the muscle directly adjacent to the femur. Representative high-resolution
radiographs of a naïve mouse femur (A), a femur from a bone-injected mouse (B), and a muscle-injected (C) mouse at day 28 after cancer cell injection revealed the
greater tumor volume present in the muscle-injected mouse than in the femur-injected mouse. D, tumor volumes dramatically increased following

Anti-NGF therapy attenuates bone cancer-induced
weight loss
Weight maintenance in patients with cancer remains an
important clinical challenge. In our preclinical model, a loss of
20% of baseline weight was a severe physiologic event requiring
removal from the study and euthanasia. Our data show that at
day 28 after cancer cell injection, when there was signiﬁcant
disease progression and bone destruction, mice treated with
anti-NGF therapy had only lost approximately 2% of their
baseline weight, whereas vehicle-treated mice had lost approximately 6% of their baseline weight (Fig. 5).

Anti-NGF attenuates spontaneous and movementevoked bone cancer pain behaviors
To determine the efﬁcacy of anti-NGF in reducing bone
pain in both early- and late-stage bone cancer disease,
spontaneous nocifensive behavior exhibited by vehicle- and
anti–NGF-treated mice was analyzed with respect to bone
score (Fig. 6A). Mouse movements deﬁned as "nocifensive"
were full guarding, reducing weight-bearing and abnormal
grooming of the affected limb, and also sporadic hopping
using the nonaffected limb (see Materials and Methods and
Supplementary Videos). Spontaneous nocifensive behavior
associated with a bone score of 0 was minimal for both
treatment groups (approximately 25–30 seconds, 8%–10% of
the 300-second assessment period), and was reﬂective of the
pain experienced the week following cancer cell injection

by the fact that at day 28 after NCTC 2472 cell injection, the
percent of anti–NGF-treated mice with evidence of fracture

due to the surgical procedure. This pain was not NCTC 2472induced bone cancer pain (Figs. 2 and 4B).
Bone scores of 1–2, indicative of mild bone destruction
and early-stage bone cancer disease, in vehicle-treated mice
were associated with a mean spontaneous nocifensive
behavior of 195.0  5.3 seconds. In contrast, in anti–NGFtreated mice, bone scores of 1–2 were associated with a
mean spontaneous nocifensive behavior of 85.0  22.9
seconds. Thus, anti-NGF treatment reduced pain in earlystage bone cancer by approximately 56%. Bone scores of 3
and 4, indicative of moderate bone destruction and midstage
bone cancer disease progression, in vehicle-treated mice
were associated with mean spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of 203.8  13.5 and 255.3  17.6 seconds, respectively.

129.2  15.5 and 91.6  26.1 seconds, respectively. Taken
together, these data demonstrated that anti-NGF treatment
reduced pain in midstage bone cancer disease by approximately 40% to 60%. Bone scores of 5–6 and 7–10, indicative
of severe to extreme bone destruction (with fracture), in
vehicle-treated mice were associated with mean spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of 272.0  12.0 and 261.3  11.6

bone scores of 5–6 and 7–10 were associated with mean
spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of 93.0  32.4 and 70.4 
25.6 seconds, respectively. Taken together, these data show
that anti-NGF treatment reduced the time spent in spontaneous nocifensive behavior in mice suffering with latestage bone cancer disease by approximately 70%.

The efﬁcacy of anti-NGF in reducing bone pain in both earlyand late-stage bone cancer disease was also revealed by
analysis of spontaneous nocifensive behavior exhibited by
vehicle- and anti–NGF-treated mice with respect to time (day)
following cancer cell injection (Fig. 6B). At day 14 after cancer
cell injection, vehicle-treated mice had a mean spontaneous
nocifensive behavior of 158.8  20.3 seconds. This indicated
that approximately 50% of the total 300-second assessment
period the mice exhibited pain-related behaviors. In contrast,
anti–NGF-treated mice had a mean spontaneous nocifensive
behavior of 28.5  6.8 seconds, illustrating that cancer-induced
bone pain had been reduced 6-fold. At days 21 and 28 after
cancer cell injection, vehicle-treated mice had mean spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of 237.3  14.1 and 244.8  16.5
seconds, respectively. However, at these same time points,
anti–NGF-treated mice had signiﬁcantly reduced mean spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of 114.8  14.8 and 102.9  24.3
seconds, respectively. Taken together, these data show that at
days 21 and 28, when mice had severe to extreme bone
destruction, anti-NGF treatment resulted in mice spending
approximately 30% to 40% of the total 300-second assessment
period in spontaneous nocifensive behavior as opposed to
approximately 80% as in the case of vehicle-treated mice.
The ability of anti-NGF treatment to reduce pain-related
behaviors in both early- and late-stage bone cancer disease
was also revealed by analysis of dynamic weight bearing and
limb use in vehicle- and anti–NGF-treated mice with respect
to time (day) following cancer cell injection (Fig. 6C and D).
Measurement of dynamic weight bearing in the mouse is
equivalent to the human clinical measure of the ability to
load the tumor-bearing bone. In vehicle-treated mice, the
weight borne for the tumor-bearing limb progressively
decreased over the course of the study; at day 28 after
cancer cell injection, the ability of the tumor-bearing hind
limb to bear weight had been reduced by more 70% (Fig. 6C).
In contrast, anti-NGF treatment reduced bone cancer–
induced pain enough that the animal was capable of preserving the ability of the tumor-bearing hind limb to bear
weight. At days 21 and 28 after cancer cell injection, the
percent weight borne by tumor-bearing hind limbs of vehicle-treated mice (18.4  2.4, 16.6  3.2, respectively) was
signiﬁcantly less than that of anti–NGF-treated mice (45.7 
2.2, 46.6  2.3, respectively). Assessment of mouse limb use
in an open ﬁeld, comparable with assessment of gait, posture, and the spontaneous use of the affected limb in
humans, demonstrated that anti-NGF treatment prevented
limb use impairment. A total of 12 different mouse movements or postures were included as evidence of limb
impairment (see Materials and Methods). At day 28 after
cancer cell injection, vehicle-treated mice had signiﬁcantly
more limb impairment, indicated by a higher limb use score
(4.0  0.3) than anti–NGF-treated mice (2.2  0.2; Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In the current study, we used a mouse model of sarcomainduced bone cancer and showed that early treatment with
anti-NGF reduced tumor-induced bone destruction, delayed

7020

time-to-fracture, and increased the use of the tumor-bearing
limb. In addition, as suggested in previous studies in animal
models of osteoarthritis (39) and head/neck cancer (40), early
blockade of NGF also reduced weight loss in animals with bone
cancer. In terms of the extent and time course of pain relief,
blockade of NGF reduced bone cancer pain by 40% to 70%,
depending on the pain measure being assessed, and this
analgesic effect was maintained even in animals with latestage disease.
NGF and bone cancer disease progression
In the current study, NGF blockade delayed bone cancer
disease progression; measured by time-to-fracture, tumorinduced bone destruction, and tumor-bearing limb use.
What the speciﬁc mechanisms that maintain the integrity
and use of bone remain unclear, but previous data in both
older individuals and those with CMB have suggested that
exercise and loading of the bone promotes bone health.
Previous studies in human clinical trials in patients with
moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain showed that antiNGF attenuated this pain by 40% to 50%. However, within
this group, a small but signiﬁcant number of patients
receiving the highest dose of anti-NGF and naproxen
required earlier-than-expected joint replacement. Whether
this earlier-than-expected joint replacement was caused by
overuse of the arthritic joints due to the robust pain relief
provided by anti-NGF, or was a direct effect of blocking NGF
on the maintenance and formation of adult bone remains
unknown (10). However, in patients with CMB, fracture of
the tumor-bearing bone is a highly undesirable event as
active tumor-induced bone destruction makes stabilization
and repair of the fractured bone problematic.
NGF and weight loss
A second major ﬁnding of the present study is that antiNGF in this model of sarcoma-induced bone cancer reduced
weight loss at late-stage time points. This anti-NGF inhibition of weight loss conﬁrms and extends what was previously reported in a rat model of Freund's induced osteoarthritis (39), and a mouse model of head/neck cancer (40),
where anti-NGF markedly reduced weight loss. Currently, we
do not know whether this inhibition of weight loss in
the present study was due to blockade of a circulating
anticachexia effect or reduction in pain/disease progression,
which allows the animal to maintain an appetite. Anti-NGF
may indirectly affect weight loss by impacting the circulating
levels of variety of cytokines (e.g., TNFa, IL6, and leptin)
proposed to be involved in the regulation of body mass and
cachexia. Chronic anti-NGF antibody treatment did not
promote weight gain in normal rodents (39), thus the
relationship between anti-NGF and weight is not straightforward. Given that opiates (commonly used to relieve
cancer pain) have not been shown to reduce weight loss in
patients (41), pain reduction and weight maintenance in the
patient with cancer appear not to be directly correlated.
However, what is clear is that as CBM progresses, maintenance of body weight and muscle mass has an important
impact on the functional status of the patient.

NGF Reduces Bone Cancer Disease Progression

Pain induced by tumor growth in bone versus muscle
A third aim of the current study was to examine whether
tumor growth per se would be correlated with the extent of
pain. To explore this possibility, we compared the pain induced
by injection of NCTC 2472 cells into the bone versus the pain
induced by injection of the same tumor cell line into the
overlying muscle. Interestingly, while there was a clear increase
in pain when tumor cells were injected, conﬁned, and grew
within the bone, there was negligible pain following injection of NCTC 2472 cells into the muscle, despite the development of a tumor mass >50 that in bone. These data extend
previous data showing that it is not size, but rather location
and speciﬁc nerve innervation, that inﬂuences tumor-induced
pain (8, 9, 11, 42, 43).
Early versus late administration of anti-NGF following
cancer metastasis to bone
Current clinical trials are examining or considering examining the blockade of NGF/TrkA in terms of being an analgesic
and not a disease-modifying agent. However, the current data
suggests that whether anti-NGF can reduce tumor-induced
bone destruction, time-to-fracture, weight loss, and CMB pain,
and also maintain the functional status of patients, then early
rather than late administration of anti-NGF following the
initial diagnosis of CMB appears warranted. Currently, following diagnosis of CMB, where the initial diagnosis of CMB is
frequently mild-to-moderate bone pain, patients usually are
put on the WHO "analgesic ladder" for treatment of cancer
pain, which consists of NSAIDs alone, then NSAIDs þ weak
opiate, and ﬁnally NSAIDs þ strong opiate. However, NSAIDs
inhibit bone formation and opiates have numerous side effects,
including nausea, dizziness, constipation, and somnolence (9).
In contrast, blockade of NGF or TrkA has remarkable efﬁcacy
in attenuating skeletal pain, and a total of 11,000 patients that
received anti-NGF for nonmetastatic skeletal pain had relatively few side effects (16).
One major concern with administering anti-NGF to humans
with late-stage disease bone cancer pain is that the patient

Preclinical versus clinical measures of bone cancer
disease progression and pain
Essential to the translational success of an emerging
therapy is its validation in a preclinical animal model that
incorporates end points directly translatable to those that
can be used in human clinical trials. In the clinic, commonly
measured end points for bone cancer disease progression
and functional status include radiologic assessment of bone
destruction and time-to-fracture (5), weight loss (45), evaluation of gait and weight-bearing (46, 47), and pain (48–50).
As illustrated in Fig. 7, preclinical (mouse) measures incorporated in the current study to monitor disease progression,
functional status, and pain closely mirror the human clinical
measures used.
Limitations and conclusions of the study
To provide a clinically relevant animal model of bone
cancer pain, we originally developed and have recently
optimized a mouse model in which mouse NCTC 2472
osteolytic sarcoma-producing cells are injected directly into
the intramedullary space of the femur, following which the
injection site is sealed with bone cement (13, 27–33).

facilitate the bench-to-beside
translation of preclinical data

critical that the preclinical animal
model incorporate end points that
are directly translatable to end
points that can be used in human
clinical trials. To that end, we have
included in our bone cancer model
a variety of preclinical measures of
disease progression, functional

typically will already be on NSAIDs þ strong opiate, making it
difﬁcult to discern even an analgesic effect. However, in clinical
trials if anti-NGF is given early (immediately upon diagnosis of
CMB), and anti-NGF does have the positive effects on maintaining bone health, preventing bone fractures and weight loss,
and reducing skeletal pain, early therapy with anti-NGF may
signiﬁcantly help in maintaining the functional status and
quality of life of the patient. This would be especially true in
a population of breast cancer patients who are young women
(20–44 years old), and in the early or midstage of their careers
and/or raising a family. As survival times of these young
women with metastatic breast cancer have signiﬁcantly
increased (44), an important and unmet objective is to maintain their functional status and quality of life without the
unwanted side effects of currently available therapies.

Surgical implantation of NCTC 2472 cells directly into the
femoral intramedullary space enables a preclinical animal
model that mirrors the development of bone cancer pain
and bone remodeling in humans. The critical advantage of
this method of bone cancer induction is that tumor cells are
conﬁned within the marrow space of the femur and prevented from invading surrounding soft tissue. However, this
surgical procedure itself causes nocifensive behavior that is
observed in the ﬁrst week following surgery, and consequently, an important consideration in optimizing our bone
cancer model was to ensure that an appropriate number of
NCTC 2472 cells were injected such that assessment of
sarcoma-induced bone cancer pain was not confounded by
the presence of postsurgical (orthopedic) pain. Injection of
too high a concentration of NCTC 2472 cells would induce
signiﬁcant tumor burden and bone destruction within a few
days after surgery and preclude differentiation between the
pain caused by the arthrotomy from that of cancer-induced
changes in bone remodeling.
Additional limitations of the current study are that the
in vivo analysis was only performed using one tumor cell
line, and that a single species and gender was used in the
current study. However, previous work from our laboratory
has investigated the effect of anti-NGF on bone cancer pain
using implantation of breast cancer and prostate cancer
cells (11, 12, 14, 15). These previous studies and the current
study show anti-NGF effectively attenuates bone pain in all
three mouse models of bone cancer pain.
Concerning the potential for observer bias in the analysis of
pain behavior, we believe that due to the preventive measures
taken in this work we have precluded, as much as humanly
possible, the occurrence of subjective and biased pain measurements. Personnel measuring pain behaviors and analyzing
X-rays were scrupulously blinded to the therapy treatments.
Parameters for spontaneous nocifensive pain and limb use
were speciﬁcally delineated before the start of this work, and
videotaping of mice enabled careful (and repeat) analysis of
limb movements. Use of a commercial, ﬂoor-instrumented

dynamic weight bearing system enables objective measurement of weight borne by both ipsilateral and contralateral
hind limbs.
The major conclusions of the current study are that early,
sustained sequestration of NGF reduces tumor-induced bone
destruction, delays time-to-fracture, increases use of the
tumor-bearing limb, and reduces weight loss in animals with
bone cancer. Blockade of NGF reduced bone cancer pain by
40% to 70%, depending on the pain measure being assessed,
and this analgesic effect was maintained even in animals with
late-stage disease. Given the potential effects of sequestration
of NGF on disease progression, weight loss and pain, and the
side effect proﬁle observed with the 11,000 individuals who
have received anti-NGF therapy to date (16), early rather than
late blockade of NGF may improve the functional status and
quality of life of patients with CMB.
