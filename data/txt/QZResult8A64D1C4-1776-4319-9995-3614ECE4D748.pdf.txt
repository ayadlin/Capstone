Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), represent promising agents for new therapeutic
approaches of infected wound treatment, on account of their antimicrobial and wound
closure activities, and low potential for inducing resistance. However, therapeutic
applications of these AMPs are limited by their toxicity and low stability in vivo.
Previously, we reported that the 23 amino-acid designer peptide TP3 possessed
antimicrobial activities. Here, we analyzed the wound closure activities of TP3
both and in vivo. TP3 at doses of up to 40 μg/ml did not affect the viability of baby
hamster kidney cells. Furthermore, TP3 was found to be highly effective at combating
peritonitis and wound infection caused by MRSA in mouse models, without inducing
adverse behavioral effects or liver or kidney toxicity. TP3 treatment increased survival
by 100% at 8 days after infection, and accelerated the progression of proliferation,
remodeling, and maturation of infected wounds. Taken together, our results indicate
that TP3 enhances the rate of survival of mice infected with the bacterial pathogen
MRSA through both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects. Overall, these
results suggest that TP3 may be suitable for development as a novel topical agent
for treatment of infected wounds.

INTRODUCTION

against a variety of microorganisms [6, 7].
Tilapia piscidin 3 (TP3) is an AMP isolated
from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and was
characterized as early as 2012. Tilapia piscidin 3, also
known as TP3, is a 23 amino acid peptide that starts with
phenylalanine (F) and ends with histidine (H) [8]. TP3 is
a pore forming peptide with an α-helix structure, which
confers selective cytolytic activity against bacteria. In
addition to disrupting bacterial membranes, Tilapia α-helix
AMPs have been reported to stimulate immunogenicity,
induce a TH1 cellular immune response, and serve as
adjuvants for vaccines in fish [9]. TP3 has antimicrobial
activity against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria
[8]. Furthermore, clinical case studies have shown that
application of AMPs to severely infected cutaneous

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent
particularly promising agents for new therapeutic
approaches of infected wound treatment, as they possess
antimicrobial and wound closure activities, and offer
little opportunity for the development of resistance [1, 2].
AMPs are short amino acid chain molecules involved in
the first line of defense against invading pathogens [3].
In addition to host defense, they are also involved in the
modulation of innate immunity [4]. Piscidins are cationic
AMPs expressed by fish mast cells [5]. The piscidin family
consists of structurally-related mature peptides of 21~44
residues that possess an amphipathic α-helical structure,
which suggests that piscidins have bactericidal activities

wounds can clear the infection and improve healing [10].
In addition, previous studies have confirmed that AMPs
have immunomodulatory function [11]. A recent study
reported that AMPs may promote resistance to bacterial
infections by stabilizing the cytoskeleton network in host
cells [12]. Thus, TP3 has many features consistent with
antibiotics, but potentially has broader applications, and
may avoid or reduce concerns of bacterial resistance.
The skin functions as a physical barrier against
microbial pathogens. Once this physical barrier is
disrupted by wounding, however, microbial pathogens
can gain access to tissues [13]. A major problem with
skin injuries is the high risk of infection. To treat
wound infections, several antibiotic drugs, such as
chloramphenicol, gentamicin, neomycin, and bacitracin,
are applied topically to open sores. However, the routine
use of topical antibiotics leads to the progressive decline
of therapeutic efficacies of these antibiotics due to the
development of antimicrobial resistance [14-16]. Hence,
there is a strong need for the development of new classes
of drugs for the treatment of infected wounds.
Treatment with effective antimicrobial agents
can both help reduce the risk of infection, and reduce
the overall time required for wound healing. Bacteria
can colonize wounds within 48 hours after injury, and
bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Streptococcus spp. may prolong the
inflammatory phase of wound healing [17]. Thus, topical
or systematic application of suitable antimicrobial
agents may prevent wound infection and/or accelerate
wound healing. Inflammation involves the release of
biologically active mediators, which attract macrophages
and lymphocytes to the wound area; these cells attack
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

foreign debris and microorganisms through phagocytosis
[18]. The goal of the current study was to examine the
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing
properties of TP3 treatment in MRSA-infected mice. We
investigated whether combination treatment of a mouse
model with peptide and non-peptide antimicrobial agents
can (i) improve the antimicrobial activity of the peptides,
(ii) identify novel candidates for antibacterial therapeutic
drugs, (iii) inhibit bacterial growth, and (iv) accelerate
wound healing.

RESULTS
In vitro toxicity and efficacy of TP3
We first studied the cell toxicity of TP3 in BHK-21
cells. Measurement of cell toxicity by neutral red, LDH,
and MTT assay revealed that TP3 at various concentrations
(up to 40 μg/ml) did not affect cell viability (Figure 1A1C). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for TP3
was > 3.9 μg/ml against MRSA. Similarly, > 3.9 μg/ml of
TP3 effectively killed MRSA suspended in 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (Figure 1D).

TP3 does not exert acute toxic effects in mice
Acute toxicity tests for TP3 were evaluated in mice
using the up-and-down procedure [19]. Mice received
TP3 at a limited dose of 2 mg/mouse via intramuscular
(i.m.) injection, and biochemical factors in the blood were
subsequently measured. The animals were continuously

observed for toxic symptoms for the first 3 hr after dosing.
Finally, the number of survivors was noted after 24 hr,
and these animals were then maintained for a further 6
days, with observations made daily. Serum samples were
collected by tail bleeding at 1, 3, and 6 days. TP3 did not
induce any significant changes in the levels of blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), total glucose (GLU),
or creatine phosphokinase (CPK). On the other hand,
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic
pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were significantly increased
at the first day after injection, but over time returned to
normal levels (Table 1). Our results suggest that TP3
does not induce systemic toxic effects, even at the highest
concentration tested (2 mg/mouse).

We proceeded to investigate the bactericidal effects
of TP3 in vivo, by monitoring the survival of mice infected
with MRSA prior to treatment with TP3 or antibiotic.
All untreated mice infected with MRSA died within 72
h of infection, whereas co-treatment with TP3 decreased
the mortality rate (Figure 2A). At 8 days after MRSA
infection, the survival rates were 100%, 80%, and 0% for
mice treated with TP3 (0.005 mg/g), vancomycin (0.01
mg/g), and methicillin (0.01 mg/g), respectively. The

(1x106 CFU/mouse), and independent groups (N = 5) were subsequently injected with TP3, vancomycin, and methicillin. The survival rate

survival rates of 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40%, respectively.

rates of lethality by 48 h in the untreated groups were
20% in mice infected with MRSA, and treatment with
TP3 or vancomycin significantly decreased the rate of
mortality (Table 2). Bacteriological evaluation revealed
that untreated mice infected with either strain exhibited
100% positive blood cultures and a high level of bacterial
colonization (with the numbers of CFU/g being no lower
than 106) for all organs tested (Table 2). TP3 treatment
significantly reduced the bacterial burden in all examined
organs compared to those of untreated controls (P <
0.05). These data indicate that TP3 can efficiently control
MRSA in the organs of infected mice. To determine the
curative potential, mice were first injected with MRSA
and then with TP3 (0.005 mg/g) 10, 60, 120, or 180 min
later. At these injection times, the MRSA experimental
groups exhibited survival rates of 100%, 80%, 60%, and
40%, respectively (Figure 2B). The survival rates of mice
treated with TP3 were consistently greater than those of
untreated mice (PBS-treated control mice). These data
indicate that immediate application of TP3 (0.005 mg/g) is
important to prevent severe infection. Application within
10 to 60 min of MRSA infection enabled TP3 to act as
an effective curative agent. As such, we proceeded to use
TP3 in wound healing infection experiments, and explored
antibacterial activity and the promotion of wound repair.

mice, and it is unlikely that this process can be significantly
improved. However, untreated infected wounds resulted
in death in the first week (Figure 3B). Treatment with
vancomycin resulted in a similar wound closure time
to the control, while wound closure was accelerated by
treatment with TP3 alone. Such an increase in wound
closure was not observed in uncontaminated wounds,
suggesting that TP3 may facilitate wound recovery by
combating infection. Unlike the uncontaminated wounds,
wound size was largely unchanged after one week in all
treatment groups (Figure 3B). By 14 days, wound size
in the TP3-treated group was smaller than that of the
vancomycin-treated group (P < 0.05). However, both
groups demonstrated full closure by the end of the 30th
day (Figure 3C).

Microbial loads in treated wounds
The increase in wound size in untreated
contaminated wounds, and the lack of closure in the
MRSA and MRSA+Meth (methicillin) treatment groups
(Figure 3B), suggested active wound infection. This
was supported by quantitative assessment of the wound
flora (Table 3). The initial inoculum of approximately
4.5~5.2x104 CFU/10 μl of each organism increased
to about 6.7~7.3x108 CFU/10 μl in the MRSA and
MRSA+Meth groups by day 3. Between days 3 and 5, the
colony counts in the MRSA+Vanc and MRSA+TP3 groups
decreased, with the most rapid decrease being observed
in the TP3 group (significantly different as compared to
the other groups at day 5). In clinical practice, attempts to
count MRSA colonies through culturing anaerobes from
skin wounds often result in underestimates, due to the
aerobic nature of the site. Thus, we evaluated the wounds
using Gram staining of tissues, to determine if anaerobes

Efficacy of TP3 at promoting in vivo wound
closure
First, we examined whether TP3 promoted healing
of wounds made in an aseptic manner (Figure 3A). We
did not observe any statistical difference between the
areas of untreated wounds and TegadermTM or antibiotictreated wounds, with all closing by day > 25. This was
not unexpected, as skin wounds heal efficiently in healthy

on the skin exceeded the counts achieved by quantitation
of aerobes (Figure 4A). Quantitation of the number of
Gram-positive organisms per high-power field in the upper

dermis reflected the quantitative cell counts. As expected,
bacterial loads were reduced more quickly upon treatment
with antimicrobial agents.

staining revealed accumulation of immune cells in the skin
of infected mice treated with MRSA (Figure 5).

The above data demonstrating enhanced wound
closure suggest that treatment with TP3 alone facilitate
maturation of the dermal matrix. We examined this
via routine histological analyses (Figure 4B). Dermal
maturation is normally assessed at the proliferation,
remodeling, and maturation stages. Wounds treated with
TP3 exhibited accelerated progression at all three of these
stages. Accelerated healing was also noted in the epidermal
compartment (Figure 4B). Wounds treated with TP3 were
multilayered as in normal skin, and fully mature by day
25. Keratinization and regeneration of the epithelium
showed no signs of irregularity, whereas wounds treated
with TegadermTM and MRSA+Vanc displayed impairment
in overall epidermal maturation as compared to the TP3
group. As such, we proceeded to examine whether TP3
promotes the innate immune response and cytokine
production after wound healing in infected mice. Giemsa

Mechanism of TP3 activity
Next, we examined the mechanism underlying the
direct antimicrobial activity of TP3. The ability of TP3
to modulate the immune cells of mice was measured
using IHC (Figure 6) and real-time PCR (Figure 7). IHC
with cell surface marker antibodies revealed a significant
increase in the infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes,
and CD8 (cytotoxic cells) in infected wounds treated with
antibiotic. Such infiltration of immune cells was reduced
in the TP3 group (Figure 6), which may be because AMPs
directly kill bacteria and thus reduce the area affected by
the mouse innate immune response. The pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL-6 acts as a potent modulator of innate
immunity, while the chemokine CXCL5 enhances the
recruitment of macrophages to tissue surrounding wounds

DISCUSSION

[20]. We analyzed wound tissue chemokine and cytokine
levels in MRSA-infected mice at 1, 3, and 5 days after
treatment. Inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-10, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), and
nitric oxide, modulate the wound-healing response [21].
MRSA-infected mice were used as a positive control to
confirm cytokine activation. TP3 treatment decreased
induction of TNF-α and IL-6. CXCL5 is well known to
have chemotactic and activating effects on neutrophils,
mainly during acute inflammatory responses [22]. TP3
treatment decreased CXCL5 as compared to the positive
controls (Figure 7).

Wound healing involves the precise orchestration
of inflammation, epithelialization, tissue granulation,
and remodeling. Some AMPs exert antimicrobial effects
by directly killing pathogens, or by indirect modulation
of the host defense system through enhancing immune
responsive cells [23]. Following our previous studies on
the effects of AMPs, we examined the suitability of TP3
as a wound-healing agent in a mouse model of MRSA
infection. Here, we used a clinically relevant model
suitable for elucidating the pathophysiology underlying
impairments of wound healing, and for testing novel
therapeutic agents. Our study is the first to analyze the
toxicity of TP3 in vitro. Cell toxicity assays (neutral
red, LDH, and MTT assays) were used to reveal that

antibodies against macrophages (M), lymphocytes (Lym), or CD8, as indicated. R = 3; N = 3. Magnification, x100. The length and height

TP3 did not affect cell viability at concentrations of up
to 40 μg/ml. Our systemic toxic effect analysis revealed
that injection of 2 mg/mouse TP3 does not cause serious
side effects in mice. No toxic or other side effects were
observed following treatment of mice with TP3, even at
relatively high concentrations (2 mg/mouse) within 60
minutes of exposure. TP3 was also demonstrated to have
anti-bacterial activity against MRSA in vitro, consistent
with a previous report that TP3 inhibits bacterial growth
[8]. TP3 demonstrated potent bactericidal activity when it
was administered to mice after challenge with MRSA. TP3
treatment resulted in 100% clearance of MRSA bacteria
from blood after 48 h. Moreover, MRSA CFU decreased
in the peritoneum, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph
nodes after 48 h of TP3 treatment. The data reported
here illustrate the potential anti-endotoxin properties
of TP3. We used our in vivo system to demonstrate that

intraperitoneal administration of 0.005 mg/g of TP3 was
effective at treating an MRSA infection, increasing the
survival rate, and reducing endotoxin and MRSA plasma
levels, as compared to antibiotic treatment. Taken together,
these findings highlight the utility of TP3 in treating
MRSA-infected mice.
We proceeded to evaluate the potential clinical
use of TP3 as compared with conventional antibiotics,
which are generally the last line of defense against MRSA
infections of wounds. Wound healing is associated with a
systemic pro-inflammatory state. Our recent clinical work
demonstrated that skin leukocyte infiltration is increased
during wound healing in patients [24]. Similar to these
clinical findings, we observed here increased leukocyte
infiltration in the skin of mice during wound healing. This
increase was most likely due to increased macrophage
infiltration associated with chronic inflammation.

while controls were untreated. At different days after infection, total RNA was isolated from the wound and reverse transcribed for use
in real-time qPCR analysis of TNF-α, IL-6, and CXCL5 gene expression. R > 3; n > 3. Values with different letters show significant
differences (P < 0.05), as determined by ANOVA. n.s., not significant; *, significant (P < 0.05); **, significant (P < 0.001).

Given the prophylactic efficacy of TP3, and its inability
to engender resistance, it may be suitable for situations in
which there is a high risk of infection.
3. Our model is valuable for future research on the
pathophysiology of wound healing, as well as for testing
new therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infection
during wound healing.

Although pre-injury chronic inflammation is deleterious
for wound healing, post-injury inflammation, generated
through sufficient leukocyte infiltration and cytokine
release, is necessary for wound healing. Peptide-based
wound healing studies have been reported previously
[2], and we applied this platform to demonstrate that TP3
facilitates the healing of infected wounds.
TP3 treatment caused a decrease in TNF-α, IL-6,
and CXCL5 at the site of infection on days 1, 3, and 5;
on the other hand, MRSA infection induced TNF-α and
IL-6. Both Gram-negative (LPS) and Gram-positive
(lipoteichoic acid) signature molecules cause up-regulation
of pro-inflammatory cytokines through processes that
are suppressed by cationic peptides [26]. Cytokines
IL-6 and IL-12 play a major role in innate immune
activation during wound healing [27]. Accumulation of
macrophages and lymphocytes at the wound-healing site
produce inflammatory responses, which are mediated by
chemokine CXCL5 gene expression [28]. Although TP3
itself caused a modest increase in IL-6 gene expression as
compared to the control, this was lower than that induced
by MRSA on day 1. The basis for the anti-inflammatory
effect of TP3 may be due to contributions from several
related mechanisms, including that of IL-10 [23].
Furthermore, TP3 reduced MRSA-induced TNF-α at the
wound site on day 1.
Drug development efforts focusing on regulation
of the innate defense system have been limited, in part,
because of the potential for inducing harmful sepsis
responses [29]. Indeed, most antibiotics stimulate the
release of bacterial pathogen-associated signature
molecule components [30], and thus contribute to the
risk of damaging inflammation and sepsis. We have
identified that TP3 can directly kill pathogens and reduce
inflammation caused by infection, and thereby has
potential to provide prophylaxis or treatment of a broad
spectrum of infections, while balancing or controlling the
attendant inflammatory response. In vivo data indicate
that TP3 treatment decreases macrophage and lymphocyte
recruitment at day 3 after infection. Macrophages have
been shown to (i) phagocytose and directly kill bacteria;
(ii) deprive bacteria of vital nutrients; (iii) produce
cytokines that influence the differentiation state and
growth of macrophages themselves and other immune
cells; and (iv) recruit other cells. In our study, TP3 induced
key chemokines that were likely to be responsible for
monocyte and/or macrophage recruitment to the site of
infection, and decreased inflammatory cytokines induced
by infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and mice
The Baby Hamster Kidney cell line (BHK-21)
was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media
(RPMI-1640) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
fetal bovine sera. Balb/c female mice were used for all
experiments. All mice were housed in cages under specific
pathogen-free conditions, and given water and standard
laboratory chow ad libitum during the experiments. All
animal handing procedures were in accordance with
National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU) guidelines.
All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of NTOU.

Reagents
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) (Cat no. 105175, Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) and Giemsa stain solution (Cat no.
51811826, Sigma, MO, USA) were used for histological
staining. Antibodies against macrophages (Cat no. 550282,
BD Biosciences, CA, USA), lymphocytes (CD3e) (Cat

and status were recorded every 24 h for up to 192 h. To
examine bacterial dissemination, mice were sacrificed
at 48 h after injection with antibiotics or TP3, and the

and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). The molecular masses and
purities of the purified peptides were respectively verified
by mass spectroscopy and HPLC. Synthetic peptides at
> 95% purity were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for the experiments. The TP3
sequence was FIHHIIGGLFSVGKHIHSLIHGH.
Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
were determined using standard protocols [32]. For
MIC assessment, compounds were diluted to final
concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62,
7.81, 3.9, 1.95, 0.97, 0.48, 0.24, and 0.12 µg/ml. Twenty
microliters of each dilution was mixed in a microtiter
plate well with 20 µl of the appropriate bacterial indicator
suspension and 160 µl of TSB for S. aureus to a total
volume of 200 µl. Three replicates were examined for
each S. aureus strain, compound, and concentration.
Positive controls contained water instead of compounds,
and negative controls contained compounds without
bacterial suspensions. Microbial growth was automatically
determined by optical density measurement at 600 nm
(Bioscreen C; Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland). Microplates
(catalog no. 3599; Corning, NY, USA) were incubated at
37°C. Absorbance readings were taken at hourly intervals
over a 24-h period, and the plates were shaken for 20 s
before each measurement. The experiment was repeated
twice. The lowest compound concentration that resulted
in zero growth by the end of the experiment was taken as
the MIC.

Mouse models for wound healing

To determine the toxicity of TP3, TP3 was
dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4)
and administered as intramuscular bolus injections in the
left thigh (2 mg/mouse). Mice were observed for signs
of systemic toxicity. To study the effect of treatment on
biochemistry, mice (n = 6 in each group) were treated with
PBS (control). Blood samples (0.2 ml) were collected on
days 1, 3, and 6 after the final injection of TP3, and used
to determine the serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase
(GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), total
glucose (GLU), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).

Female Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were used
for wound healing experiments. All mice were housed
individually to prevent fighting and further damage
to the wounds, and they were provided with food and
water ad libitum. Mice were maintained on a 12h light:
dark cycle at room temperature, and acclimatized to the
environment for at least a week before use in experiments.
All researchers wore caps, sterile gloves, gowns, and shoe
covers when handling mice. Hair was removed from the
back of the mice by shaving, and a full thickness wound
(1 cm in diameter) was then created in the exposed region.
Each wound was inoculated with 50 μl of broth mix
containing 106 CFU (colony forming units) of MRSA.
At 5 min after inoculation, 50 µl TP3 (2 mg/ml dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were applied to the
wound. Thirty minutes after treatment, wounds were
covered with Tegaderm (3M, St. Paul, MN) to maintain
uniformity, and to prevent the mice from removing the
treatments. Based on initial experiments, we examined
the wounds at 0, 3, 5, and 19 days post-injury, so as not
to disturb the infection [27]. Such examinations captured
the transitions from inflammatory to regenerative, and
regenerative to resolving phases of wound healing [28].
Animals were subsequently euthanized by CO2 inhalation
and the wounds assessed. Four individuals in each group
were examined at each time point for each experiment.
Each wound was measured and then removed from the
animal, with unwounded skin taken from the contralateral
dorsum as a control. Each biopsy was bisected with three

Therapeutic use in a mouse model of MRSA sepsis

Wound closure measurements

Female Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were injected
intraperitoneally with 106 CFU MRSA per mouse. Ten
minutes after MRSA injection, mice were injected
intraperitoneally with vancomycin (0.01 mg/g mouse
body weight), methicilin (0.01 mg/g mouse body weight),
or TP3 (0.005 mg/g mouse body weight). In a second set
of experiments, mice were given intraperitoneal injections
of TP3 (0.005 mg/g mouse body weight) at 10, 60, 120,

Tracings were taken immediately after injury. For
uncontaminated wounds, wound size was determined
every second day. For contaminated wounds, mice were
euthanized at days 3, 5, and 19, and tracings of the wound
edges were made. Wound areas were determined using
the Macintosh Adobe Photoshop program, Histogram
Analysis. The percentage of wound contraction was
calculated as follows: % Wound contraction = (A0 – At)/

the area of wound at the time of biopsy (every two days)
[30].

Kits (BIO-RAD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis was used to analyze gene expression,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The iQSYB®
Green Supermix (BIO-RAD, USA), 0.5 ml of cDNA, and
500 nM of specific primer pairs were used for selected
genes, and a primer pair for GAPDH was used for the
reference. Quantitative PCR was performed under the
following conditions: 40 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 30 s
at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The threshold cycle number
(Ct) was calculated with BIO-RAD software. Relative
transcript quantities were calculated using the ΔCt method
with GAPDH as the internal reference gene. ΔCt is the
difference in the threshold cycles of messenger (m)RNA
for selected genes relative to those of GAPDH mRNA.
Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate for each
experimental group.

Assessment of wound infection
Multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) commonly associated with human wound
infections were selected to generate a polymicrobial
solution. The MRSA strain is a clinical isolate from stool
obtained from Taipei City Hospital (Heping Fuyou branch)
[33]. The initial inoculum was prepared by culturing
aerobic bacteria in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) overnight at
37°C. Broths were subsequently centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 15 min, and resuspended in TSB with 15% glycerol,
or chopped meat extract with 15% glycerol (for aerobic
bacteria). The concentration was adjusted to 106 CFU/50
μl, and stored at -80°C. Prior to wound application, the
bacterial stocks were re-mixed. Microbial load was
determined by direct plating, followed by freeze-thaw
and CFU enumeration, in parallel with inoculations. The
inoculum was delivered by sterile pipettes to the center of
open wounds. After euthanasia (at day 0, 3, 5, or 19), two
bisected tissue segments were used to determine microbial
load using the protocol for human wound biopsy culture,
as stated in the UPMC Clinical Microbiology Laboratory
Procedure Manual. Tissue biopsies were weighed and
placed in 1.5 ml of TSB, and then homogenized in a tissue
grinder. A single drop of the homogenate was placed on
the slide and Gram stained for rough assessment (if one or
more bacteria are present within the oil immersion field,
the expected count in the tissue is at least 105 CFU/g).
Serial dilutions (1:10 [0.1 μl original solution plus 0.9
μl distilled water]) of the tissue homogenate were made
using distilled water. The CFU/g of tissue was calculated
as follows:
CFU/g = plate count (1/dilution) x 10/wt. of
homogenized tissue.

Statistical analysis
The experiments were conducted with three or
more replicates, and repeated at least three times. Error
bars represent the standard deviation, and significant
differences between groups (P < 0.05) were determined
using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Different letters
above the bars were used to indicate significant differences
between groups. Histological and in vivo study results
were representative of three independent experiments. A
group of 7 mice was used for each treatment, and each
experiment was repeated three times.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Skin tissues were removed and fixed as previously
described [34]. In brief, the cryosections were fixed with
4% formaldehyde, and the tissue samples were stained
with hematoxylin/eosin, Giemsa, or Gram stain. IHC was
analyzed by three independent investigators. Images were
taken using a BX-51 microscope (Olympus, Japan).

This work was supported by research funding and a
personal salary from the Marine Research Station (Jiaushi,
Ilan), Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology,
Academia Sinica (Taiwan), to Dr. Jyh-Yih Chen.
