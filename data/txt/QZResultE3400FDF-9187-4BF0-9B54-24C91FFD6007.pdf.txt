ABSTRACT
Here, we report the chemotherapeutic effect of honokiol, a phytochemical
from Magnolia plant, on human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Treatment of HNSCC cell lines from different sub-sites, SCC-1 (oral cavity), SCC5 (larynx), OSC-19 (tongue) and FaDu (pharynx) with honokiol inhibited their cell
viability, which was associated with the: (i) induction of apoptosis, (ii) correction of
dysregulatory cell cycle proteins of G0/G1 phase. Honokiol decreased the expression
levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mTOR and their downstream
signaling molecules. Treatment of FaDu and SCC-1 cell lines with rapamycin, an
inhibitor of mTOR pathway, also reduced cell viability of HNSCC cells. Administration
of honokiol by oral gavage (100 mg/kg body weight) significantly (P < 0.01-0.001)
inhibited the growth of SCC-1 and FaDu xenografts in athymic nude mice, which was
associated with: (i) inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, (ii) induction of apoptosis,
(iii) reduced expressions of cyclins and Cdks, and (iv) inhibition of EGFR signaling
pathway. Molecular docking analysis of honokiol in EGFR binding site indicated that
the chemotherapeutic effect of honokiol against HNSCC is mediated through its firm
binding with EGFR, which is better than that of gefitinib, a commonly used drug for
HNSCC treatment.

INTRODUCTION

needed. These new treatments can be given in combination
with available treatment options to lower the doses of
toxic drugs and to overcome drug resistance. An effective
treatment strategy must ensure treatment efficacy, reduced
toxicity and improved quality of life in the patients
suffering from HNSCC. Chemoprevention of cancer
can be considered as an appropriate complementary and
alternative strategy for HNSCC treatment.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
been reported to be overexpressed in approximately 90%
of HNSCC, and the overexpression of EGFR has been
associated with poor clinical outcomes of HNSCC [1012]. Therefore, EGFR is considered as a promising target
for the treatment of patients suffering from HNSCC.
Cetuximab (an FDA approved drug for the treatment of

Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck
(HNSCC) is a commonly occurring malignancy worldwide. Despite the advances in conventional therapies, the
overall survival rate for HNSCC has only been modestly
improved. Mortality rate has remained approximately
50% for the past three decades and is responsible for
approximately 20,000 deaths in the United States
annually [1-5]. Available therapies, including conventional
chemotherapy and surgical resection, are often associated
with considerable toxicity, drug resistance, impairment
of speech and swallowing functions [6-9]. Therefore,
the developments of new and promising strategies or
complementary and alternative therapies are urgently

HNSCC) and some other investigational drugs which
include the use of small molecule inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib)
target EGFR. However, the poor response rates, toxicity
and resistance of these drugs or inhibitors have limited
their use as therapeutic agents for HNSCC [13, 14].
Therefore, development of less toxic and less resistanceassociated alternative treatment options is urgently needed.
Some natural phytochemicals that are non-toxic
in nature with medicinal values can be considered as
promising candidates for the prevention and treatment
of cancers. These phytochemicals can be used as
complementary and alternative medicine and/or as
adjuvant therapy for the conventional cytotoxic therapies.
Honokiol (C18H18O2), a biphenolic compound, is such a
phytochemical and is a bioactive constituent found in the
bark and leaves of Magnolia plant. The diverse biological
and pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory,
antifungal, anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic, of
honokiol have been investigated in recent years [15-19].
The chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects of
honokiol have been reported previously in several tumor
models, including skin, breast, melanoma, non-small
cell lung cancer and prostate [15-19]. Anti-carcinogenic
effect of honokiol was also determined against HNSCC
cells using in vitro and in vivo models and EGFR was

recognized as a molecular target [13]. However, the anticarcinogenic potential of honokiol with definitive EGFR
binding using molecular docking analysis and molecular
mechanism has not been explored in HNSCC. We
hypothesize that honokiol inhibits the growth of HNSCC
cells by targeting and binding firmly with EGFR. To test
our hypothesis, we assessed the chemotherapeutic effect of
honokiol on HNSCC cell lines derived from different subsites, such as larynx (UM-SCC5), pharynx (FaDu), tongue
(OSC19) and oral cavity (UM-SCC1) [20].

RESULTS
Honokiol inhibits cell viability of HNSCC cells
The effect of honokiol on viability of HNSCC cells,
SCC-1, SCC-5, OSC-19 and FaDu, were determined
using an MTT assay. The cells were treated with different
concentrations of honokiol (0, 20, 40 and 60 µM) for
24, 48 and 72 h. A dose- and time-dependent inhibition
in viability of HNSCC cells was observed, as shown in
Figure 1. The reduction in the viability of the SCC-1 and
FaDu cells observed after treatment with honokiol ranged

manner. The HNSCC cells (SCC-1, SCC-5, OSC-19 and FaDu) were treated with various concentrations of honokiol (0, 20, 40 and 60
µM) for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h and cell viability was determined using the MTT assay. The data are expressed in terms of percent of control
cells (non-honokiol-treated) as the mean ± SD of 5 replicates. Significant difference vs. control group, *P < 0.05; ¶P < 0.01; **P < 0.001.

using the Alexa488 Apoptotic Cell Detection Kit using
flow cytometry, as detailed previously [20]. The number
of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined in terms of
the percentage of early-stage and late-stage apoptotic cells,
which are shown in lower right (LR) and upper right (UR)
quadrants of the FACS histogram, respectively (Figure
2A), and as detailed previously [21]. Treatment of the
FaDu and SCC-1 cells with honokiol for 48 h resulted in
a significant induction of apoptotic cell death in both cell
lines. The percentages of total apoptotic cells (UR+LR
quadrants) in FaDu cells after honokiol treatment ranged
from 18.1% (20 μM) to 44.4% (60 µM) compared to
only 7.8% in non-honokiol-treated control cells. Similar
range of apoptotic cell death after honokiol treatment was
observed in SCC-1 cells (Figure 2A).

respectively from 16% to 89% (P < 0.001) and 15% to
94% (P < 0.001) after 72 h (Figure 1). Under identical
conditions, similar effects were observed on treatment of
SCC-5 and OSC-19 cells with honokiol.

Treatment of HNSCC cells with honokiol induces
apoptosis
FACS analysis was performed to quantitate the
percentage of apoptosis in HNSCC cells. As honokiol
induced inhibition of cell viability was almost similar in
all the four cell lines studied, FaDu and SCC-1 cell lines
were selected for further investigation. FaDu and SCC1 cell lines were treated with various doses of honokiol
and quantitative analysis of apoptosis was determined

Cancer cell apoptosis is tightly regulated by
functions of the proteins of Bcl-2 family, and proteins
of Bcl-2 family act as promoters or inhibitors of cell
death [22-24]. Western blot analysis and subsequently
measurement of band densities revealed that treatment
of FaDu and SCC-1 cells with honokiol (0, 20, 40, 60
µM) for 48 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the
expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 whereas the
expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax was increased
with increasing doses of honokiol treatment (Figure 2B).
As shown in Figure 2B, honokiol treatment also resulted
in an increase in activated form of caspase-3 in both FaDu
and SCC-1 cell lines.

honokiol on these proteins was identical in both cell lines.

Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling,
inhibits cell viability of FaDu and SCC-1 cells
To verify honokiol-mediated adverse effects on cell
viability in HNSCC cells through EGFR/mTOR pathway,
FaDu and SCC-1 cells were treated with rapamycin (0,
1, 10, 20, 40 and 100 μM) for 24, 48 and 72 h, and the
effect on cell viability was determined using MTT assay.
Treatment of cells with rapamycin had no significant
effect on cell viability after the treatment of cells for 24 h,
while rapamycin reduced the cell viability in FaDu (20%72%) and SCC-1 (22%-49%) cells after 48 h treatment.
The inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell viability was
greater at 72 h time point than at 48 h (Figure 3B). The
effect of rapamycin was also determined on the mTOR
and its down-stream protein targets after treating the cells
with rapamycin for 48 h. The protein expression levels
of mTOR, 4E-BP1 and p70SK6 were decreased in a
dose-dependent manner after treatment with rapamycin
as analyzed by western blotting (Figure 3C), suggested
the involvement of mTOR pathway in inhibition of cell
viability in SCC-1 and FaDu cells by rapamycin.

Honokiol decreases the expression levels of cyclins
and Cdks in HNSCC cells
Cyclins and Cdks have been implicated to play
important roles in cell cycle regulation and that affect
the proliferation of cells [25, 26]. Therefore, the effect
of honokiol was determined on the levels of cyclins and
Cdks of G0/G1 phase following the treatment of FaDu and
SCC-1 cells with honokiol for 48 h. Western blot analysis
revealed that treatment of these cells with honokiol (0,
20, 40 and 60 μM) resulted in a concentration-dependent
decrease in the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin
D2. Similarly, decrease in the levels of Cdk4 and Cdk6
proteins was also observed after honokiol treatment, as
shown in Figure 2C.

siRNA knockdown of EGFR results in suppression
of HNSCC cell viability
In order to better understand the role of EGFR
in honokiol-mediated suppression of HNSCC cell
viability, the FaDu and SCC-1 cell lines were subjected
to knockdown of EGFR using siRNA transfection
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
downregulation of EGFR in cell lines was verified using
western blot analysis (Figure 4A). Transfected and control
cells were grown and cell viability was determined in both
cell lines using MTT assay. MTT assay analysis indicated
that the cell viability or proliferation potential of EGFR
knocked down cells was significantly decreased (P <
0.01) compared to control cells, as shown in Figure 4B.
Further, the treatment of EGFR siRNA transfected SCC-1
and FaDu cells with honokiol or gefitinib (an inhibitor of
EGFR) for 48 h did not result in significant inhibition of
cell viability compared to cells not treated with honokiol
or gefitinib (control cells) (Figure 4C).

Honokiol decreases the levels of EGFR, p-EGFR
and downstream targets of EGFR signaling
pathway in HNSCC cells
As it has been shown that EGFR is overexpressed
in approximately 90% of HNSCC [10-12], the effect of
honokiol was determined on EGFR in HNSCC cells after
treating the FaDu and SCC-1 cells with honokiol for 48 h.
Western blot analysis and measurement of band densities
indicated that treatment of FaDu cells with honokiol
resulted in reduction in the levels of EGFR and p-EGFR
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Similar effect
of honokiol on the levels of EGFR and p-EGFR was also
observed when SCC-1 cells were treated with honokiol
(Figure 3A).
As mTOR and its downstream signaling molecules
are the downstream targets of EGFR signaling mechanism,
we further checked whether inhibition of EGFR by
honokiol also affect the expression levels of mTOR and
associated signaling proteins. As shown in Figure 3A,
treatment of both FaDu and SCC-1 cells with different
concentrations of honokiol (0, 20, 40 and 60 μM)
decreased the levels of mTOR as well as the protein
levels of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K in both cell lines in a dosedependent manner. The pattern of inhibitory effect of

of drinking water and AIN76A diet by the mice in each
group was identical (data not shown) and the mice that
were administered honokiol did not exhibit impaired

movement and/or any other visible sign of physical
toxicity. The average body weight of the honokioladministered and non-honokiol-administered control mice
remained almost identical throughout the 5 weeks duration

Administration of honokiol reduces the
expressions of cell cycle regulatory proteins of G0/
G1 phase in tumor xenograft tissues

of the experimental protocol (Figure 5A).
The treatment of mice with honokiol resulted in
reduced growth of both FaDu and SCC-1 xenografts.
As shown in Figure 5B, administration of honokiol
significantly inhibited the growth of FaDu tumor
xenografts in the nude mice (59%, P < 0.001, n
= 6) compared with vehicle-treated control mice.
Administration of honokiol at the same dose also
resulted in a significant inhibition (42%, P < 0.01) in
the growth of SCC-1 tumor xenograft (Figure 5B, right
panel). At the termination of the experiment on the 35th
day of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed, tumors
were harvested and the wet weight of the tumor/mouse
in each treatment group was weighed on digital balance.
The wet weight of the FaDu tumors was 64% lower (P
< 0.001) in mice administered honokiol compared with
non-honokiol-treated control mice (Figure 5C, left panel).
Administration of honokiol at the same dose also resulted
in a significant reduction (42%, P < 0.001) in the wet
weight of the SCC-1 tumor xenografts (Figure 5C, right
panel) compared to non-honokiol-treated control mice.

As the cell cycle regulatory proteins of G0/G1
phase play a critical role in tumor cell growth [25, 26],
we determined the effect of honokiol on the regulatory
proteins of G0/G1 phase in tumor xenograft samples. As
shown in Figure 6C, treatment of mice with honokiol
resulted in a marked decrease in the expressions of cyclin
D1 and cyclin D2 and reduced expressions of Cdk4 and
Cdk6 in tumor samples obtained from honokiol-treated
mice compared to tumor samples from control mice.

Honokiol modulates the expression levels of
EGFR and mTOR signaling pathways in tumor
xenograft of HNSCC cells
Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of
mice with honokiol inhibited the levels of EGFR as
well as p-EGFR in tumor xenograft samples from both
FaDu and SCC-1 cells compared to the tumor samples
from the control mice (Figure 6D). Honokiol treatment
also decreased the levels of pAkt in tumors while the
levels of Akt remained unchanged. Further, inhibitory
effect of honokiol on EGFR in tumor xenografts was
also associated with reduced expressions of mTOR and
its down-stream target proteins p70S6K and 4E-BP1,
suggesting the involvement of these molecular targets in
preventing the in vivo growth of HNSCC xenografts by
honokiol in mice (Figure 6D).

The inhibition of tumor xenografts growth by
honokiol was associated with its inhibitory effects
on PCNA and alterations in proteins of Bcl-2
family
Western blot analysis and subsequent measurements
of band densities in different blots of tumor lysates
indicate that treatment of mice with honokiol inhibited
the levels of PCNA in tumors compared with the tumor
samples from non-honokiol-treated control mice (Figure
6A). These observations were further verified by
immunohistochemical detection of PCNA-positive cells in
tumor xenograft samples from FaDu and SCC-1 cells. As
shown in Figure 6B, the intensity of PCNA-positive cells
was lower in the tumor samples from honokiol-treated
animals compared to the tumors from control animals.
Another reason of reduced growth of tumor xenografts
by honokiol treatment may be due to the apoptotic cell
death of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the levels of
the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xl, was reduced while the
levels of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, were higher in
xenograft tumors from the animals treated with honokiol
than tumors from control mice. Additionally, the levels of
activated caspase-3 were higher in the tumor samples from
the mice treated with honokiol compared to tumor samples
from control mice.

Molecular docking analysis: Binding of honokiol
in the EGFR binding site
We determined whether the anti-HNSCC effect of
honokiol is due to the binding between honokiol (Figure
7A, molecular structure) and EGFR molecules. For this
purpose we used molecular docking analysis as detailed
in Materials and methods. The docking model of honokiol
in EGFR showed that it fits snuggly in the binding site
as shown in the Figure 7B. The reference ligand gefitinib
was also docked in the active site of EGFR for comparison
purposes (data not shown). Honokiol showed better
affinity with EGFR compared to gefitinib as indicated by
the binding scores obtained from Surflex docking. Higher
binding scores show better binding of the compound with
the protein. Honokiol has a binding score of 5.5471 as
compared to 4.3014 for gefitinib. Critical interactions of
honokiol in the EGFR binding site were also examined
(Figure 7C). The OH groups of honokiol were found to
have two important hydrogen bond interactions within
the active site. The first hydrogen bond was between OH
group of ring A of honokiol (Figure 7A) with Glu762

the OH group of ring B and Lys745 (2.49 Å) (Figure

the rings A and B of honokiol were found to occupy two
hydrophobic pockets in the binding site. The chain on ring

A of honokiol interacted with hydrophobic residues such
as Leu788, Ile789 and Ile744 and the second hydrophobic
chain on ring B of honokiol interacted with hydrophobic
residues such as Leu718, Val726, Leu844 and Leu792.

binding affinity with EGFR than gefitinib, we determined
the effect of gefitinib on the cell viability of FaDu and
SCC-1 cells and compared with honokiol using identical
experimental conditions as were used with honokiol
(Figure 1). For this purpose, FaDu and SCC-1 cell lines
were treated with gefitinib (0, 20, 40 and 60 μM) for 24,
48 and 72 h, and cell viability was determined using MTT
assay. MTT assay results indicated that treatment of FaDu
and SCC-1 cells with gefitinib resulted in inhibition of cell
viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure
7E). However, the inhibitory effect of gefitinib on HNSCC
cell viability was lower than that of honokiol at equimolar
concentrations (Figure 1).

Cdk-cyclin activity [29]. Apoptosis plays a crucial role
in eliminating the hyper-proliferating neoplastic cells or
mutated neoplastic cells from the system, and therefore
is considered as a protective mechanism against cancer
progression [30]. Therefore, honokiol seems to be a potent
chemotherapeutic agent for HNSCC.
It is known that EGFR is over-expressed in
majority of the HNSCC and its abolition is considered
as a therapeutic effect of any drug in head and neck
cancer clinically. Our study demonstrates that treatment
of FaDu and SCC-1 cell lines with honokiol decreases
the expression levels of total EGFR as well as p-EGFR
and its downstream target mTOR. Activation of mTOR
has been shown to contribute in tumor growth and
progression. Thus, it can be suggested that inhibition of
cell proliferation by honokiol is mediated, at least in part,
through the downregulation of EGFR/mTOR signaling
pathway. To further verify that inhibition of mTOR and
its downstream targets by honokiol play a critical role in
HNSCC growth, FaDu and SCC-1 cells were treated with
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, and its effect on cell
viability was examined. It was observed that treatment
of cells with rapamycin results in significant inhibition
of HNSCC cell viability as well as decrease in the levels
of mTOR and its downstream targets. Additionally,
treatment of EGFR siRNA transfected human HNSCC
cells (FaDu and SCC-1) with honokiol or gefitinib did
not result in significant inhibition of cell viability. Based
on these observations, it appears that honokiol acts as an
antagonist and/or causes increased turnover of EGFR, thus
accounting for decreased expression of EGFR in HNSCC
cells. These observations verify and support the evidence
that honokiol inhibits the growth of HNSCC cells in vitro
by targeting EGFR and its downstream molecular targets.
The therapeutic effect of honokiol against HNSCC
was further examined and verified using in vivo pre-clinical
model. These in vivo animal studies were necessary for
the potential consideration of the use of honokiol in
humans. Therefore an in vivo model of tumor xenografts
was used to verify the chemotherapeutic potential of
honokiol against HNSCC cell growth. The outcome
of this study provides evidence that administration of
honokiol by oral gavage inhibits the growth of FaDu and
SCC-1 tumor xenografts without any apparent visible
sign of toxicity in mice. Other investigators also have
assessed the therapeutic effect of honokiol using tumor
xenograft model but that study indicated that treatment
of honokiol did not show significant inhibition of tumor
xenograft growth in athymic nude mice [13]. In this study
the investigators used only one HNSCC cell line, 1483,
and it seems that the effect of honokiol was cell linespecific. Additionally, the in vivo dose of honokiol used
in that study was lower than the dose of honokiol used
by us in the current study. The identification of molecular
targets is an important subject of consideration in terms
of monitoring the clinical efficacy of cancer therapeutic

DISCUSSION
HNSCC is a challenging clinical problem due to the
persisting high rate of this malignancy. To develop newer
and more effective candidates or drugs for HNSCC, we
examined the effects of honokiol on various cell lines of
HNSCC using both in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we
report that honokiol significantly decreased the viability
and induced apoptosis in various cell lines of human
HNSCC, which were derived from tongue, larynx, oral
cavity and pharynx, suggesting that honokiol possesses
broad therapeutic effect on this malignancy. However,
we did not find significant inhibition of cell proliferation
of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) after honokiol treatment [18]. A major apoptotic
signal transduction cascade associated with induction of
apoptosis includes the proteins of Bcl-2 family, which
either promote cell survival or promote apoptotic cell
death [27, 28]. We found that induction of apoptosis in
FaDu and SCC-1 cells by honokiol was associated with
a decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and
a simultaneous increase in the pro-apoptotic proteins.
Suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins of this family
preserves the integrity of the mitochondria. Control of
cell cycle progression in cancer cells is considered to be
an effective strategy for the control of cancer growth [25,
26]. Our in vitro data indicated that treatment of HNSCC
cells with honokiol affects the cell cycle proteins of G0G1 phase, which indicates that one of the mechanisms
by which honokiol may act to inhibit the cell viability or
proliferation of HNSCC cells is down-regulation of the
cell cycle regulatory proteins. Our finding of a marked
decrease in the levels of cyclin D1, D2 and Cdks in
FaDu and SCC-1 cells on honokiol treatment suggests
the disruption of the uncontrolled cell cycle progression
of these HNSCC cells. This act of honokiol may be
one of the possible mechanisms of anti-carcinogenic
effect in HNSCC cells. The increased expression of G1
phase cyclins in cancer cells provides an uncontrolled
growth advantage because most of these cells either
lack cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdki) or the

agents and strategies in suggesting potential combinations
with other therapeutic drugs. The inhibitory effect of
honokiol on tumor xenograft growth was associated with
the: (i) inhibition of PCNA, and correction of dysregulated
proteins of cell cycle regulation, (ii) induction of apoptotic
cell death of tumor cells, as indicated by the increased
levels of activated caspase-3, and (iii) reduction in the
levels of EGFR, pAkt and mTOR, including downstream
targets of mTOR signaling in tumor xenograft samples
collected at the termination of the in vivo animal
experiments. Most importantly, (iv) we found and verified
using molecular docking analysis that honokiol binds to
EGFR firmly and this binding affinity of honokiol with
EGFR was even greater than gefitinib, a commonly used
drug for HNSCC. Conclusively, honokiol appears to be
an attractive bioactive small molecule phytochemical for
the management of head and neck cancer which can be
used either alone or in combination with other available
therapeutic drugs. However, more mechanism-based
studies are required in vivo models with honokiol to
further identify and verify the molecular targets associated
with this malignancy.

protein assay kit was procured from Bio-Rad (Hercules,
CA). 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT), rapamycin and all other chemicals were
of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO).

MTT assay for cell viability
The effect of honokiol on the viability of HNSCC
cells was determined using MTT assay, as detailed
previously [18, 20]. Gefitinib was dissolved in a small
amount of dimethylsulfoxide (100 μl) then mixed in
culture medium to achieve desired concentrations. The
effect of honokiol and gefitinib on cell viability was
calculated in terms of percent of control cells (nonhonokiol- or non-gefitinib-treated), which was arbitrarily
assigned a value of 100% viability.

Apoptotic cell death analysis using flow cytometry
Honokiol- induced apoptotic cell death of
HNSCC cells was determined quantitatively by flow
cytometry using the Annexin V-conjugated Alexa
fluor488 (Alexa488) Apoptosis Detection Kit following
the manufacturer’s protocol, also as described by us
previously [20]. Briefly, cells were treated with different
concentrations of honokiol for 48 h, then harvested,
washed with PBS buffer and incubated with Alexa488 and
propidium iodide. The stained cells were then analyzed
by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using the
FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HNSCC cell lines and cell culture conditions
The HNSCC cell lines derived from the tongue
(OSC-19), pharynx (FaDu), oral cavity (UM-SCC1) and
larynx (UM-SCC-5) were obtained from Dr. Rosenthal
(Department of Otolaryngology, University of Alabama at
Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). No further authentication
was done by the authors. Cells were grown as monolayer
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. For
the treatment of cells, honokiol was dissolved in a small
amount of ethanol (100 µl), diluted as required in culture
medium (maximum concentration 0.1%, v/v) and added to
sub-confluent cells.

Western blot analysis and analysis of band density
Following treatment of HNSCC cells with or
without honokiol the cells were harvested, and cell
lysates were prepared [18, 20]. Similar to cell lysates,
tumor xenograft tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer.
Lysates thus prepared were subjected to western blot
analysis to detect the levels of various proteins of interest,
as described previously [18, 20]. Equal protein loading
on the gel was verified using anti-β-actin antibody on the
same membrane. In some cases, western blot membranes
were cut into two or three parts according to the molecular
weight of the proteins and subjected to incubation with
the different antibodies, etc. Protein ladders were used as
a molecular weight marker to identify different proteins.
The relative density of each band in an immune-blot was
measured using the ImageJ software (National Institute of
Health). The numerical value of band density is shown
under each blot, and the band density of control group was
arbitrarily selected as ‘1’ and comparison was then made
with densitometry values of other treatment groups.

Honokiol, chemicals and antibodies
Purified honokiol was purchased from Quality
Phytochemicals LLC (Edison, NJ). Antibodies specific
for Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, cleaved caspase 3, cyclin D1,
cyclin D2, mTOR, 4E-BP1, p70S6 kinase, pEGFR and
EGFR were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA). Gefitinib and antibodies specific for
PCNA, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), β-actin and
horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-goat and
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). The Annexin
V-conjugated AlexaFluor488 Apoptosis Detection Kit was
purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The

Transient transfection of EGFR siRNA in HNSCC
cells

One part of the tumor was used to prepare paraffin block
for immunohistochemical analyses and other part was
used to prepare tumor lysates for western blot analyses.
Tumor samples from two mice were pooled and lysates
were prepared in each experimental group, n = 6.

For functional analysis, the expression of EGFR in
FaDu and SCC-1 HNSCC cells was knocked down using
human-specific EGFR siRNA Transfection Reagent Kit
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 2x105 cells per
well were seeded onto 6-well culture plates. The EGFR
siRNA mix with transfection reagents or scrambled siRNA
reagents were overlaid on the cells for seven h at 37oC
and then transferred into 2x growth medium for about 24
h. After 24 h of transfection, cells were kept in a culture
medium containing 2% FBS up to 48 h. The cells were
then harvested and used for cell viability assays. Cells
treated with scrambled probe were used as controls for the
transfected cells. The knock down of EGFR expression in
cells after transfection was confirmed using western blot
analysis.

Molecular docking analysis of honokiol
Molecular docking is a computational approach used
to evaluate the interactions between ligand and its target.
EGFR was identified as a possible target of honokiol as
it decreased the expression levels of EGFR, p-EGFR
and downstream targets of EGFR signaling pathway in
HNSCC cells. In order to support this hypothesis, we
carried out the docking analysis of honokiol with EGFR
using the Surflex-Dock module of Sybyl X 1.2 software
from Tripos Inc. (St. Louis, MO) [31]. Honokiol structure
was built by using ‘sketch’ option in Sybyl X 1.2 and
energy-minimized using conjugate gradient algorithm with
a gradient convergence value of 0.01 kcal/mol. Partial
atomic charges were calculated using the Gasteiger–
Huckel method. Surflex-Dock implements an incremental
construction search approach as in Hammerhead and
also a new fragment assembly methodology for docking
[32, 33]. It uses a flexible molecular docking algorithm
that combines the empirical scoring function from the
Hammerhead with a new molecular similarity method to
generate binding poses of ligand fragments in the receptor
binding site. Surflex-Dock score is represented in the units
of –log (Kd) to represent the binding affinities of the ligand
[32]. The high resolution X-ray crystallographic structure
of EGFR was taken from protein data bank (www.rcsb.
org) which has binding affinity for the well-known cancer
drug, gefitinib (PDB ID: 4WKQ), an EGFR-tyrosine
kinase inhibitor. The same binding site was used to dock
honokiol. Gefitinib was also docked in to the same binding
site for comparison.

Tumor xenograft study using athymic nude mice
Four-to-five week old (16-18 g/mouse) female
immune-deficient athymic nude mice were purchased
from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Frederick,
MD) and housed in the Animal Resource Facility at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham in accordance
with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) guidelines. Animal protocol was approved by
the IACUC. To determine the in vivo chemotherapeutic
efficacy of honokiol against HNSCC tumor xenograft
growth, exponentially growing SCC-1 and FaDu
cells (2×106 in 100 µl PBS/mouse) were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank of each mouse. One
day after tumor cell inoculation, animals were divided
randomly into two groups per cell line with six mice
per group. Mice in Group I were treated with 100 mg
honokiol/kg body weight of mouse in 200 µl of 0.5%
carboxymethylcellulose (w/v) in 0.025% Tween-20 (v/v)
solution in sterile water by oral gavage twice per week.
This dose of honokiol for oral gavage was selected from
the previous study where treatment of nude mice with
honokiol significantly inhibited tumor xenograft growth
of non-small cell lung cancer cells [18]. Mice in Group II
received same vehicle only and served as vehicle treated
control group. Mice were monitored for their body weight,
diet and water consumption on regular basis throughout
the experiment period. Tumor size was monitored twice
per week. At the termination of experiment, mice were
euthanized and tumors were harvested. Tumor size was
measured by vernier calipers and volumes were calculated
using the ellipsoid model formula: tumor volume = ½
(4π/3) (l/2) (w/2) h, where l = length, w = width and h =
height. The wet weight of the tumor mass was recorded at
the termination of the experiment using digital balance.

Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of the difference between
the values of control and treatment groups was determined
by either Student t test or simple one-way ANOVA using
GraphPad Prism program (San Diego, CA). In each case P
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
