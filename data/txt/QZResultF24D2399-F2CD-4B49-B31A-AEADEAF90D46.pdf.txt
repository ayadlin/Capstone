Abstract
Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) may offer an intervention therapy in
autoimmune diseases or transplantation. Stable immaturity and tolerogenic function
of tDCs after encountering inflammatory environment are prerequisite for positive
outcome of immunotherapy. However, the signaling pathways regulating their stable
tolerogenic properties are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that
human monocyte-derived tDCs established by using paricalcitol (analogue of vitamin
D2), dexamethasone and monophosphoryl lipid A exposed for 24h to LPS, cytokine
cocktail, polyI:C or CD40L preserved reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules,
increased levels of inhibitory molecules ILT-3, PDL-1 and TIM-3, increased TLR-2,
increased secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β, reduced IL-12 and TNF-α secretion and
reduced T cell stimulatory capacity. tDCs further induced IL-10-producing T regulatory
cells that suppressed the proliferation of responder T cells. In the inflammatory
environment, tDCs maintained up-regulated indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase but
abrogated IκB-α phosphorylation and reduced transcriptional activity of p65/RelA,
RelB and c-Rel NF-κB subunits except p50. Mechanistically, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, mTOR,
STAT3 and mTOR-dependent glycolysis regulated expression of ILT-3, PDL-1 and
CD86, secretion of IL-10 and T cell stimulatory capacity of tDCs in the inflammatory
environment. Stability of tDCs in the inflammatory environment is thus regulated by
multiple signaling pathways.

Introduction

4, and/or programmed death ligand (PDL)-molecules.
Additionally, tDCs secrete low amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and high quantities of antiinflammatory cytokines, such IL-10. This results in the
attenuation of T cell stimulatory capacity and/or induction
and expansion of T regulatory cells (Tregs). Different
approaches targeting DCs differentiation and function
have been shown to establish tDCs in vitro [3-5]. Notably,
dexamethasone (Dex) and/or vitamin D (VitD) receptor
agonists (1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogues) have been
described to generate tDCs through the suppression of
NF-κB-dependent DCs maturation [6, 7]. Such Dex/VitD
conditioned tDCs have been shown to acquire a robust

Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen
presenting cells that, depending on their activation
status, can induce tolerance or immunity [1]. Tolerogenic
DCs (tDCs) can be generated from precursor cells
in vitro and represent potentially promising tool for
inducing or restoring immune tolerance in the context of
transplantation and autoimmune diseases [2]. Tolerogenic
DCs are usually defined by low or intermediate expression
of co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40

immunoregulatory phenotype and are currently tested
in early stage clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis [8].
One of the major concerns associated with in
vivo administration of in vitro established tDCs is their
functional stability. Once injected into patients with
chronic inflammation, such as autoimmune disease, tDCs
should remain stable and retain their tolerogenic properties
in the absence of tolerogenic agents. Furthermore, there
is a potential risk that ex vivo differentiated tDC might
switch to an activated phenotype when encountering proinflammatory signals in vivo and contribute to the further
expansion of the autoimmune reaction.
The pro-inflammatory DC maturation initiated
by pathogen associated molecular patterns or by
inflammatory cytokines is connected with the activation
of numerous signaling pathways including transcription
factor NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway [9, 10]. Recently, the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been
reported to coordinate the production of pro- versus antiinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes and DCs
through regulating NF-κB and signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity [11, 12].
The pattern of activated signaling events triggered in
tolerogenic DC maturation is profoundly different and is
associated namely with activation of extracellular-signalregulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and non-canonical NF-κB
pathway [13-15]. However, little is known about the
signaling pathways triggered in tDCs after encountering
inflammatory environment and their role in preserving
tolerogenic properties of tDCs.
In this study, we established a good manufacturing
practice (GMP)-compliant protocol for the human
tDCs differentiation using paricalcitol (19-nor-1,
25-dihydroxyvitamin D2), synthetic analogue of active
form of VitD2 that retains significant immunomodulatory
activity [16] and immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone
(Dex). Finally, VitD2/Dex-generated tDCs (Dex/VitD2
tDCs) were activated with monophosphoryl-lipid A
(MPLA), a non-toxic alternative of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), to obtain so-called “alternatively activated
tDCs” with improved tolerogenic properties as reported
previously [17]. We comprehensively tested their
phenotypic and functional stability after mimicking
inflammatory environment by using LPS, cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines (CC), polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid (polyI:C) and CD40L. In our study, we addressed for
the first time a detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms
responsible for the maintenance of stable tolerogenic
properties of tDCs in the inflammatory environment.

tDCs
preserved
semimature
tolerogenic
phenotype after restimulation with LPS, CC,
polyI:C and CD40L
To study the functional properties and stability of
tDCs, we cultured freshly isolated human monocytes in
GMP–compliant medium Cell Gro in the presence of GMCSF, IL-4, and tolerogenic factors Dex and VitD2. Control
DCs (cDCs) were cultured without Dex and VitD2.
Finally, DCs were activated with MPLA.
As shown in Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1,
tDCs cultured in Cell Gro exhibited tolerogenic phenotype
with significantly lower surface levels of CD86, CD83,
CD80 and CD40 but higher levels of Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-2, CD14 and inhibitory molecules TIM-3 and ILT3 in comparison to cDCs. The levels of CD1a, CD11c,
HLA-DR and inhibitory molecules ILT-4, PDL-1 and
PDL-2 were comparable in tDCs and cDCs. To study the
stability of DCs, cDCs and tDCs generated in Cell Gro
were recultured in complete RPMI without tolerising
agents and subsequently stimulated with LPS, CC, polyI:C
and CD40L for 24 h (Figure 1B). Restimulation led to a
slight upregulation of CD86, CD83 and CD40 on tDCs,
however, it remained significantly lower when compared
to cDCs. Importantly, the expression of TLR2, CD14 and
ILT-3 on tDCs remained high after restimulation when
compared to cDCs. The expression of TIM-3 decreased
approximately two-fold after CC, LPS and CD40L
stimulation, however, it remained higher in comparison to
cDCs. The expression of tolerogenic molecule PDL-1, that
was low on tDCs from Cell Gro, dramatically increased
after restimulation of tDCs with CC as well as LPS and
slightly after polyI:C stimulation for 24 h.
In line with tolerogenic cell-surface phenotype,
tDCs produced higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, low
quantities of TNF-α and no IL-12p70 as compared to
cDCs (Figure 1C). Subsequent restimulation of tDCs
with CC, LPS, polyI:C or CD40L led to robust increase
of IL-10 production, slight up-regulation of TGF-β, low
production of TNF-α and minimal IL-12 production.
(Figure 1D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that,
in spite of the presence of maturation stimuli, Dex/VitD2
tDCs preserve non-proinflammatory profile with high
expression of tolerogenic markers, high IL-10/IL-12p70
ratio and sustained TGF-β production.

cells at a ratio of 1:10. TDCs were weaker inducers of

Dex/VitD2 tDCs used NF-κB, p38 MAPK and
ERK1/2 to regulate their tolerogenic properties
in the inflammatory environment

the restimulation, irrespective of the maturation agent
when compared to cDCs (Figure 2A). In line with this,
tDCs induced low IL-17A production by allogeneic T
cells even after restimulation in contrast to cDCs that
were potent inducers of IL-17A by T cells especially
after CC and LPS stimulation (Figure 2B). Moreover, coincubation of allogeneic T cells with tDCs cultured in Cell
Gro skewed the T cell cytokine profile towards reduced
IFN-γ and significantly increased IL-10 production by
CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells, in comparison to cDCs
(Figure 2C, 2D). In addition, co-incubation of T cells with
tDCs restimulated with CC, LPS, polyI:C and CD40L led
to marked reduction of CD4+ IFN-γ producing T cells
together with stable numbers of CD4+ IL-10 producing
T cells. The percentage of CD8+ IFN-γ producing T
cells remained stable or slightly decreased after CC and
CD40L restimulation of tDCs, while the amount of CD8+
IL-10 producing T cells remained almost the same after
restimulation of tDCs with LPS and slightly decreased
after restimulation of tDCs with CC, polyI:C and CD40L.

To decipher the molecular mechanisms that
play a role in maintaining tolerogenic properties of
tDCs, signaling pathways including p38 MAPK, c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (JNK/SAPK), ERK1/2, NF-κB,
indoleamine 2, 3 deoxygenase (IDO), mTOR, and
STAT3, previously reported to affect DC maturation and
orchestrate IL-10 and IL-12 production, were analyzed [9,
11, 13, 14, 22].
First, we checked whether MAPK, including p38
MAPK, JNK/SAPK and ERK1/2, are differentially
regulated in tDCs and cDCs. As shown in Figure 4A,
tDCs from Cell Gro expressed higher levels of activated
JNK/SAPK, however, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 were
comparably activated in tDCs and cDCs. After re-exposing
DCs to inflammatory stimuli, tDCs expressed higher level
of activated JNK/SAPK, lower level of the activated p38
MAPK and markedly up-regulated ERK1/2 in contrast to
cDCs.
Next, we found that tDCs expressed high level of
immunoregulatory molecule IDO in all the stimulatory
conditions tested. In contrast, IDO was absent or weakly
expressed in cDCs. These results suggest that p38
MAPK, JNK/SAPK, ERK1/2 and IDO are differentially
regulated in tDCs compared to cDCs, which might play
a role in maintaining tolerogenic properties of tDCs after
rechallenge.
Given that DC differentiation and maturation
is associated with activation of NF-κB and Dex/VitD
tDCs differentiation was shown to be mediated through
the suppression of NF-κB pathway [6, 7], we tested
whether LPS, polyI:C, CC or CD40L can reverse NFκB suppression in the absence of tolerogenic factors.
First, we documented that phosphorylation of IκB-α, a
regulatory protein that inhibits NF-κB by complexing
with and trapping it in the cytoplasm, was dramatically
reduced in tDCs in all the stimulatory conditions tested. In
contrast, IκB-α was phosphorylated in cDCs (Figure 4A).
To quantify NF-κB activation, we analyzed DNA binding
activity of NF-κB subunits p50, p65/RelA, RelB and c-Rel
in the nucleus (Figure 4B). Dex/VitD2 tDCs from Cell
Gro exhibited low binding activity of p65/RelA, and low
binding activity of RelB, shown to reflect DCs maturation
[23], and c-Rel, shown to be involved in IL-12 production
[24], in nuclear extracts when compared to cDCs. DNA
binding activities of p65/RelA, RelB and c-Rel in tDCs
remained lower even after rechallenge in the absence of
VitD2 and Dex. On the other hand, binding activity of NFκB subunit p50, shown to create homodimers increasing
production of IL-10 [25], was high in tDCs in all the
conditions tested (Figure 4B).
Next, we determined how MAPK and NF-κB

Dex/VitD2 tDCs induced Tregs differentiation
from naïve CD4+ T cells
Increased capacity to promote differentiation/
induction of Tregs from naïve precursors seems to be one
of the most important hallmarks of tDCs [19]. We showed
that co-culturing of allogeneic T cells with Dex/VitD2
tDCs induces higher and stable levels of IL-10 producing
CD4+ T cells when compared to cDCs. Previously, IL-10
producing CD4+ T cells generated by repetitive priming
of CD4+ naïve T cells with immature DCs or tDCs
generated by VitD3 were shown to display regulatory
properties [20, 21]. Thus, to test whether IL-10 producing
CD4+ T cells induced by Dex/VitD2 tDCs (referred to as
Tregs) possess regulatory activity after being expanded by
repetitive priming, we cultured naïve CD4+ T cells with
allogeneic Dex/VitD2 tDCs for two rounds of stimulation.
As shown in Figure 3A, Tregs expanded by Dex/VitD2
tDCs produced IL-10 but virtually no IFN-γ and IL-17A.
IL-10 production was increased upon specific activation
with cDCs. IFN-γ and IL-17 production was only slightly
increased upon specific activation with cDCs. To analyze
the suppressive function of Tregs expanded after two
rounds of stimulation with Dex/VitD2 tDCs, Tregs were
titrated into a MLR comprising allogeneic cDCs (from the
same DCs donor as used in the original stimulation) and
autologous responder T cells (from the same T cell donor
as Tregs). As shown in Figure 3B, Tregs dose-dependently
inhibited responder T cell proliferation. Moreover,
adding of Tregs into MLR led to up-regulation of IL-10
and down-regulation of IFN-γ and IL-17A production
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). Therefore,
IL-10 producing Tregs induced by Dex/VitD2 tDCs are
functional and suppress proliferation of responder T cells.

IL-12 production as well as CD86, ILT-3 and PDL-1
expression, we performed blocking experiments of mTOR
and STAT3 using chemical inhibitors rapamycin and
Stattic, respectively. Upon mTOR and STAT3 inhibition
tDCs reduced IL-10 production (Figure 5B). Rapamycin
and Stattic down-regulated IL-10 production after LPS
restimulation in cDCs (Figure 5B). However, in contrast to
cDCs, where rapamycin treatment markedly increased IL12 production after CC and LPS treatment, rapamycin was
not able to restore IL-12 production in tDCs irrespective
of the stimulatory agent. IL-12 production was unaffected
after Stattic treatment in both DCs tested (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, mTOR and STAT3 inhibition markedly
reduced expression of tolerogenic markers PDL-1 and
ILT-3 but significantly increased CD86 expression in
tDCs after CC and LPS trigger (mTOR inhibition) or in
all the conditions tested (STAT3 inhibition), respectively
(Figure 5C). This was paralleled by a partial restoration
of the ability of tDCs to stimulate especially CD4+ T cell
proliferation when compared to tDCs cultivated without
Rapamycin or Stattic (Figure 5D). Altogether, these data
suggest that mTOR and STAT3 controls not only IL10 production and ILT-3, PDL-1 and CD86 expression
in tDCs after restimulation but also play a role in their
immunoregulatory function.

signaling pathway utilization contributes to inflammatory
versus tolerogenic phenotype of DCs in response to
LPS, CC, polyI:C and CD40L. Before stimulation, DCs
were pretreated by p38 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, ERK1/2,
and NF-κB inhibitor SB203580, SP600125, PD98059
and Bay 11-7082, respectively. Analyzing IL-10 and
IL-12 production, we found that IL-10 production was
significantly dependent on p38 MAPK, JNK/SAPK and
ERK1/2 activation pathways after CC, LPS and CD40L
restimulation in tDCs. Also Bay 11-7082 abrogated IL10 production in tDCs. However, we observed the same
situation only after LPS triggering in cDCs (Figure 4C).
On the other hand, p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibitor
markedly down-regulated IL-12 production in cDCs
after LPS and CC triggering, but did not affect IL-12
production in tDCs. Analyzing cell-surface molecules,
we found that p38 MAPK inhibition down-regulated
ILT-3 and PDL-1 expression in tDCs, in contrast to cDCs
(Figure 4D). Moreover, ERK1/2 inhibitor down-regulated
PDL-1 expression after LPS stimulation in tDCs but
significantly up-regulated CD86 expression in tDCs in
all the conditions tested (Figure 4D). Other inhibitors
tested had no significant effect on ILT-3, PDL-1 and
CD86 expression in tDCs (data not shown). The ability
of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors to modulate IL-10
production and expression of costimulatory and inhibitory
molecules in tDCs suggest an impact on subsequent T cell
activation. By employing the allogeneic T cell activation
model, we found that ERK1/2 inhibitor increased the
ability of Dex/VitD tDCs to stimulate CD4+ as well as
CD8+ T cell proliferation when compared to tDCs without
ERK1/2 inhibitor (Figure 4E). Collectively, these data
suggest the distinct pattern of activated signaling pathways
in tDCs versus cDCs, with p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and
down-regulated NF-κB being important for maintaining
down-regulated CD86 and up-regulated ILT-3 and
PDL-1 expression, high IL-10 production and reduced
allostimulatory potential of Dex/VitD tDCs.

mTOR-dependent glycolysis regulate stable
tolerogenic properties of tDCs after restimulation
TLR-induced proinflammatory maturation and
activation of DCs was shown to be dependent upon PI3/
Akt-mediated metabolic reprogramming, switching
from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic
glycolysis [26]. mTOR is a downstream target of PI3/
Akt and was shown to regulate glycolytic metabolism
[27]. However, our data showed strong phosphorylation
of mTOR in Dex/VitD tDCs after activation with TLR
ligands, cytokine cocktail and CD40L which was not
accompanied with tDCs maturation. In addition, mTOR
inhibition down-regulated tolerogenic molecules ILT3 and PDL-1 expression and IL-10 production in Dex/
VitD tDCs. Therefore, we investigated whether mTOR
activation in tDCs is accompanied with glycolytic
activation and how glycolysis regulates stable tolerogenic
profile of tDCs in the inflammatory environment.
To investigate the glycolytic activity, glucose
consumption and lactate production were analyzed in
tDCs and cDCs supernatants as an indicator for glycolytic
activity. As shown in Figure 6A, Dex/VitD tDCs
cultured in Cell Gro secreted similar levels of lactate as
cDCs. However, the restimulation of tDCs led to robust
accumulation of lactate in cell supernatants that was
accompanied with more pronounced gradual decrease
in the media glucose content when compared to cDCs.
Consistent with the increased glucose consumption and

mTOR and STAT3 regulate IL-10 production and
ILT-3, PDL-1 and CD86 expression in tDCs after
restimulation
Recently, mTOR was found to coordinate pro- versus
anti-inflammatory events in human monocytes and DCs
by attenuating NF-κB and up-regulating STAT3 activity
[11, 12]. Western blot analysis revealed that tDCs strongly
phosphorylated mTOR and STAT3 after re-exposing
to inflammatory stimuli while the phosphorylation of
mTOR is weaker and phosphorylated STAT3 is barely
detectable in cDCs. mTOR phosphorylation led to the
phosphorylation of p70S6K, mTOR dependent event,
that was abrogated by the mTOR specific inhibitor
rapamycin (Figure 5A). To further corroborate the link
between mTOR and STAT3 activation and IL-10 and

in DC [30]. TLR-2, ILT-3 and PDL-1 signaling was
reported to participate in Tregs induction [20, 31]. In
our study, restimulation of tDCs, especially with CC and
LPS, led to up-regulation of PDL-1 and ILT-3 expression
and stable capacity to induce IL-10 producing CD4+ T
cells possessing suppressive capacity. Therefore, our data
predict that stable expression of TLR2, ILT-3 and upregulation of PDL-1 after restimulation of tDCs might
play a role in tolerance induction.
We showed that tolerogenic DCs restimulated by
inflammatory signals maintained stable cytokine profile
with high IL-10 production, up-regulated TGF-β, reduced
TNF-α and virtually absent IL-12. The high production of
IL-10 together with low production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines TNF-α and IL-12 could favor Dex/VitD2 tDCs
for immunotherapy.
Consistent with the observed tolerogenic phenotype,
Dex/VitD2 tDCs restimulated by inflammatory signals
not only showed a reduced ability to induce T cell
proliferation, but also were capable of inducing T cells
with low IFN-γ and high IL-10 production, by both
CD4+ and CD8+ compartments when compared to T
cell responses induced by cDCs. The reduction of IFN-γ
positive T cells after restimulation with concomitant stable
IL-10 positive T cells might be caused by switching T cell
response rather toward Th2 due to higher IL-10 production
from restimulated tDCs and cDCs [32].
As tDCs reported in this study produced TGF-β,
which can induce Tregs as well as Th17 cells [33], we
analyzed their Th17 polarizing activity by testing the
production of IL-17 from T cells co-cultured with tDCs.
We found that Dex/VitD2 tDCs significantly reduced IL17A production from T cells, even after restimulation
with pro-inflammatory stimuli, in contrast to cDCs. As
Th17 as well as IFN-γ contributes for pathogenesis of
autoimmune diseases [34], the reduction of T cells that
secrete IL-17A and IFN-γ might halt or reverse harmful
autoimmune processes in subjects with autoimmune
disease. Importantly, the low production of IFN-γ and
IL-17A with concomitant increased secretion of IL-10
was observed in CD4+ Tregs generated after repetitive
stimulation with Dex/VitD2 tDCs and remained similar
even upon restimulation with mature DCs. Therefore,
cytokine alterations of T cells after priming with Dex/
VitD2 DCs cannot be easily explained as the direct result
of an insufficient stimulation.
Next, we focused on activation pathways triggered
in Dex/VitD2 tDCs upon mimicking subsequent proinflammatory activation. We found stable downregulation of NF-κB pathway in Dex/VitD2 tDCs, further
documented by abrogated phosphorylation of IκB-α. In
contrast to cDCs, Dex/VitD2 tDCs exhibited low nuclear
translocation of NF-κB subunits p65/RelA, RelB and c-Rel
that have been shown to up-regulate pro-inflammatory
cytokine production [25]. Our data are consistent with the
observation that extent of nuclear expression of RelB as a

lactate production, tDCs after restimulation revealed
higher activity of cellular lactate dehydrogenase, an
oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyses the interconversion
of pyruvate and lactate, in all the conditions tested
compared to cDCs. These data suggest increased
glycolysis in Dex/VitD2 tDCs in contrast to cDCs. To test
whether mTOR regulates enhanced glycolytic metabolism
in tDCs after restimulation, we performed blocking
experiments using chemical mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.
Rapamycin markedly down-regulated lactate generation
in Dex/VitD tDCs (Figure 6B). Thus, restimulation of
Dex/VitD tDCs is accompanied by enhanced glycolysis
via mTOR activation pathway. Next, we tested whether
enhanced glycolysis regulate tolerogenic properties of
tDCs after restimulation by adding 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose
(2-DG) which acts as an inhibitor of glycolysis and
prevents generation of lactate to the DC cultures. Addition
of 2-DG to the DCs cultures significantly prevented lactate
generation in Dex/VitD tDCs (Figure 6B). Moreover,
under these conditions, tDCs failed to up-regulate ILT-3
and PDL-1 molecules (Figure 6C) and markedly decreased
IL-10 production (Figure 6D). Expression of CD86 as well
as IL-12p70 production remained unaffected upon 2-DG
treatment in tDCs in contrast to cDCs. On the other hand,
inhibition of glycolysis in tDCs increased partially the
ability to induce allogeneic CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cell
proliferation (Figure 6E). Taken together, these data show
that enhanced glycolysis alters expression of inhibitory
molecules, IL-10 production and allostimulatory potential
of Dex/VitD tDCs after mimicking in vivo subsequent proinflammatory activation.

DISCUSSION
Our analysis showed that Dex/VitD tDCs maintain
tolerogenic phenotype and function in the inflammatory
environment in the absence of tolerogenic factors. We
showed for the first time that stability of Dex/VitD tDCs
in the inflammatory environment is orchestrated by downregulated NF-κB, modest activation of p38 MAPK and
strong activation of ERK1/2, mTOR and STAT3 molecules
that regulate expression of CD86, ILT-3 and PDL-1,
production of IL-10 and IL-12p70 and allostimulatory
potential of Dex/VitD tDCs.
Recent studies showed a stable tolerogenic
phenotype of Dex and/or VitD-treated DCs in terms of
maturation markers expression and stable high IL-10
production upon repeated maturation with LPS or proinflammatory cytokines [20, 28, 29]. Our data showing
stable low to intermediate CD86, CD83 and CD40
expression in contrast to high expression of ILT-3, TIM-3,
TLR2 and PDL-1 after restimulation of tDCs corroborate
and significantly extend recent findings about the stability
of tDCs and indicate the preservation of anti-inflammatory
phenotype of tDCs [3, 20]. ILT-3 signaling was shown to
result in inhibition of NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways

in Cell Gro in presence (tDCs) or absence of Dex and VitD2 (cDCs) and activated with MPLA (CG). Then, tDCs and cDCs were washed,
recultured in complete RPMI without tolerising factors and treated with following stimuli: cytokine cocktail (CC) described in Figure
1B or LPS (1 µg/ml) or polyI:C (25 µg/ml) or CD40L (1000 ng/ml) or they were left unstimulated (RPMI). When indicated, cells were
pretreated with rapamycin or 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) for 30 min before restimulation. A. 24h later, supernatants were analyzed for
the concentration of glucose and lactate as indicator of glycolytic activity. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was analyzed in cell
lysates. B. 24 h later, suppression of glycolysis by treatment of DCs with rapamycin or 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose 30 min before restimulation
was analyzed by evaluating the concentration of lactate in DC supernatants. C. ILT-3, PDL-1 and CD86 expression on DCs after 24 h of
restimulation in the presence of glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose was evaluated by FACS analysis. D. IL-10 and IL-12 production by

p50/RelB heterodimer in DCs correlates with the degree of
maturation [23]. As c-Rel plays a role in IL-12 production
[24], down-regulated levels of c-Rel in our tDCs reflect
their abrogated ability to produce IL-12 even after
secondary stimulation when the tolerogenic agents are
absent. High levels of p50 in nucleus of tDCs can reflect
the fact that p50 homodimers repress proinflammatory
cytokine production but serve as transcriptional activators
of IL-10 [25]. The link between high levels of p50 and
high production of IL-10 in tDCs is supported by strong
reduction of IL-10 production after treatment with NFκB inhibitor Bay 11-7082 reported previously to block
phosphorylation of p50 [35].
Our data support the use of distinct MAPK
activation pathways in tDCs vs cDCs after restimulation
with inflammatory stimuli. In tDCs, activation of p38
MAPK after restimulation is lower compared to cDCs.
However, the experiments with p38 MAPK inhibitor
show that p38 MAPK plays an important role in IL-10
production and expression of tolerogenic molecules
ILT-3 and PDL-1 in tDCs. In contrast, p38 MAPK is
markedly activated in cDCs after restimulation and
controls mainly IL-12 production with no significant
effect on the expression of tolerogenic molecules. We
next show the significant ERK1/2 phosphorylation after
restimulation with all stimuli tested in tDCs but only
after LPS restimulation in cDCs. This might correlate
with marked up-regulation of IL-10 production in these
stimulatory conditions. Blocking experiments with
ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 confirmed the role of ERK1/2
in IL-10 production after inflammatory trigger in tDCs and
support the role of ERK1/2 activation in IL-10 secretion
[36]. Moreover, blocking of ERK1/2 activation partially
restored CD86 up-regulation, prevented PDL-1 upregulation and partially restored allostimulatory potential
of tDCs. These data suggest the distinct role of p38 MAPK
and ERK in tolerogenic vs pro-inflammatory maturation.
Corroborating our results, p38 MAPK and ERK were
shown to regulate PDL-1 expression in different DCs
types [37].
Dex/VitD2 tDCs also express high levels of IDO
that remains stable after restimulation. As expression of
IDO in tDCs and the ensuing production of tryptophan
metabolites has been shown to induce direct suppression
of effector T cell activity and concurrent expansion of
Tregs [14, 15], stable IDO expression might support
tolerogenic properties of Dex/VitD2 tDCs.
Finally, we newly documented that mTOR and
STAT3 inhibition led to up-regulated CD86 expression,
down-regulated ILT-3 and PDL-1 expression, downregulated IL-10 production and increased ability to
stimulate T cell proliferation in Dex/VitD2 tDCs after
restimulation. This phenotype was not observed in control
DCs in which surface expression of CD86 was downregulated but PDL-1 and ILT-3 expression remained
similar upon mTOR inhibition. Our data demonstrate the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

novel and important anti-inflammatory role of mTOR
and STAT3 in Dex/VitD2 tDCs and brings additional
knowledge about the versatile role of mTOR in DC
activation. Recently, the PI3K/mTOR pathway has been
documented as a negative regulator of TLR signaling in
human monocytes and myeloid DCs. Rapamycin-treated
myeloid immune cells display a strong Th1 and Th17
polarization [11] and are capable of blocking the antiinflammatory effects of dexamethasone [38]. It might
suggest that dexamethasone used for generation of our
Dex/VitD2 tDCs requires active mTOR for maintaining
its anti-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, mTOR
was documented to be indispensable for monocyte-derived
DC survival and differentiation [11, 12, 39]. Data from
our work suggest that in Dex/VitD tDCs, mTOR pathway
dictate the maintenance of tolerogenic DC phenotype.
Surprisingly, we showed that enhanced glycolysis
modulated via mTOR signaling pathway regulate
tolerogenic phenotype and function of Dex/VitD tDCs in
the inflammatory environment by modulating CD86, ILT3 and PDL-1 expression, IL-10/IL-12 ratio and ability to
stimulate T cell proliferation. Our data are in a contrast
to previous studies showing enhanced glycolysis and PI3/
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway being indispensable for proinflammatory maturation and function of DCs and T cells
[26, 27]. However, in line with our data, Ferreira et al.
documented very recently that tolerogenic DCs generated
by VitD3 use the activation of glucose metabolism
controlled by the PI3/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to
promote tolerogenic phenotype and function [40].
Taken together, we report that our clinical
grade Dex/VitD2 tDCs preserve their phenotypic and
functional properties upon stimulation with a variety
of biologically relevant inflammatory stimuli in the
absence of tolerogenic factors. To our knowledge, this
study describes for the first time the regulation of key
activation pathways after restimulation of tDCs in the
absence of tolerogenic agents. Our data show that tDCs
employ distinct activation pathways such as p38 MAPK,
ERK1/2, IDO, mTOR and STAT3 to maintain their
tolerogenic phenotype and immunoregulatory function
upon mimicking subsequent pro-inflammatory activation
in contrast to cDCs characterized by strong activation
of p38 MAPK and NF-κB. Distinct pattern of signaling
pathways triggered by inflammatory stimuli can also serve
as a feasible and robust identity test that would distinguish
inflammatory and tolerogenic DCs in culture. This study
on clinical grade tDCs provides a rationale for their testing
in the clinical settings, such as in autoimmune diseases or
transplantation.

Flow cytometry
Cells (2x105/well) were stained with fluorochromeconjugated mAbs for 30 min at 4°C in PBS, washed and
analysed on LSR Fortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences).
Appropriate isotype controls were included. Data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). DCs were
gated according to the forward scatter, side scatter and
CD11c+ parameters for analysis. Dead cells were excluded
from the analysis based on DAPI (4’,6-diamidin-2fenylindol) staining. For intracellular cytokine staining, T
cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) (50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) plus ionomycin (1
µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4-16 h in the presence of
Brefeldin A (5 µg/ml, BioLegend) before analysing. After
stimulation, cells were washed, incubated in Fixation/
Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4°C,
then washed in Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience) and
stained with appropriate monoclonal antibody (mAb) for
30 min at 4°C.

DC differentiation, stimulation and inhibition
Immature DCs were obtained from buffy coats
of healthy donors as previously described [18]. Briefly,
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated by Ficoll gradient and monocytes were separated
by allowing 2 h of cell adhesion in 75-cm2 culture flasks
(Nunc). DCs were generated by culturing monocytes for
6 days in GMP-grade Cell Gro DC medium (CellGenix)
containing penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100
µg/ml, respectively, Gibco) in the presence of GM-CSF
(500 IU/ml, Gentaur) and IL-4 (20 ng/ml, CellGenix).
Medium and cytokines were replenished on day 3. On day
6, DCs were harvested and seeded in 96-well plates (Nunc)
at 1x106cells/ml. On day 7, immature DCs were activated
with vacci grade MPLA (2 µg/ml, Cayla-InvivoGen) for
24 hrs. To induce tDCs, DCs were treated with Dex on day
3 (1 µM, Medochemie) and Dex and VitD2-paricalcitol
(1,5 ng/ml, Zemplar, Abbott Laboratories) on day 6.
Control DCs (cDCs) were cultured without tolerising
factors. For restimulation assays, tDCs and cDCs were
washed and recultured in complete RPMI medium
(Gibco) containing 5% human AB serum (Invitrogen)
in the absence of tolerising factors for 24 h, with or
without LPS (1 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), polyI:C (25 µg/
ml, Cayla-InvivoGen), megaCD40L™ (1000 ng/ml, Enzo
Life Sciences) or mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines

DC cytokine production
Cell supernatants were harvested after 24 h of
DC stimulation and frozen at -80°C until analysis. IL10, IL-12p70, TNF-α and TGF-β concentrations were
determined using Luminex assay (MILLIPLEX™ Human
Cytokine/Chemokine Kit, Merck Millipore) and ELISA
assay (DuoSet ELISA Kit, R&D systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell supernatants were
acidified before measuring TGF-β levels according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

DCs and T cells cultures, allostimulatory assay
T cells were obtained from PBMC non-adherent
fraction. tDCs or cDCs (2x104) were cultured with
allogeneic T cells (2x105) in complete RPMI medium
(Gibco) containing 5% human AB serum (Invitrogen).
IL-2 (20 U/ml, PeproTech) was added on day 2, 5 and
7. For primary mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)
assays, allogeneic T cells (2x105) labelled with 5

µM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
(Invitrogen) were incubated with tDCs or cDCs (2x104).
T cell proliferation was determined by the sequential
dilution of CFSE fluorescence of T cells, as detected by
flow cytometry on day 6. For detection of IFN-γ, IL-10
and IL-17A production by T cells, 2x104 tDCs or cDCs
were cultured with 2x105 allogeneic T cells. Cytokine
production was determined by intracellular staining
by flow cytometry on day 6 (IFN-γ) and day 9 (IL-10).

with indicated specific mAbs. The membranes were
revealed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) using the West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). After stripping,
the membranes were reprobed with an appropriate mAb
as loading control.

Preparation of nuclear extracts and colorimetric
NF-κB assay
Nuclear extracts were prepared from DCs (2x106)
cultured in Cell Gro or recultured in complete RPMI alone
or with cytokine cocktail, LPS, polyI:C or CD40L for 90
min using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif). NF-κB
DNA binding activity of p50, p65/RelA, c-Rel and RelB
was measured as previously described [18].

Expansion of regulatory T cells and suppression
assay
Naïve CD4+ T cells (donor A) were purified by
negative selection with The EasySep™ Human Naïve
CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Kit (StemCell Technologies).
Naïve CD4+ T cells were plated with allogeneic human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched Dex/VitD2 tDCs
(donor B) in a 10:1 ratio for 6 d in complete RPMI
(5% human AB serum) in a 24-well plate. IL-2 (20 U/
ml, PeproTech) was added on day 2 and 5. Next, T cells
were washed and rested for 2 d with complete RPMI (5%
human AB serum) and IL-2 and subsequently restimulated
with Dex/VitD2 tDCs under the same condition for 5 d.
After 5 days, T cells were recovered and rested for 2
days before use in the suppression assay. T cells primed
for two rounds with Dex/VitD2 tDCs are referred to as
Tregs. CD4+ Tregs were tested for suppressive capacity
in following MLR assay. CD4+ Tregs (donor A) were
labeled with Vybrant DiD cell labeling solution (5 µM,
Millipore), washed and plated in a round-bottom 96-well
plate coated with 1:20 000 anti-CD3 mAb (clone MEM57) with responder T cells (donor A) and MPLA-matured
cDCs (not treated with Dex and VitD2) (donor B). cDCs
were from the same donor as the Dex/VitD2 tDCs used
to induce Tregs. Cells were plated in a Treg/Tresp/DCs
ratio of 10:10:1 or 5:10:1. As additional controls, Tresp
and Tregs were cultured alone or with cDCs. After 6 d,
cells were recovered and proliferation of responder cells
was analyzed by measuring Ki-67 by flow cytometry. Cell
culture supernatants were recovered for IL-10, IFN-γ and
IL-17A analysis.

Metabolic quantification: lactate, glucose and
lactate dehydrogenase measurements
Concentrations of lactate and glucose in DC culture
supernatants were measured with Glycolysis Cell-based
assay kit (Cayman Chemicals) and Glucose colorimetric
assay kit (BioVision), respectively. When indicated,
glycolysis was suppressed by treatment with 10 mM
2-deoxyglucose (Sigma) 1 h prior exposition of DCs
cultured in Cell Gro into RPMI, LPS, CC, polyI:C or
CD40L. LDH activity of the DCs extracts was measured
with Lactate dehydrogenase activity assay kit (Sigma).

Statistical analysis
Results were obtained from at least three
independent experiments and are given as mean ± SEM.
Two-tailed paired t-test was applied for data analysis using
GraphPad PRISM 6. A value of p≤0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
