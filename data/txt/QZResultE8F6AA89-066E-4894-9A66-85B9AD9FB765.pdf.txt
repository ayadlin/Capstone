for in vitro drug screening. Data from the NCI-60 screen have led to
identification of mechanisms of drug action, approval of new
chemotherapy drugs (e.g., bortezomib), and basic advances in the
understanding of cancer mechanisms (1–3). Continued screening
of potential chemotherapy agents and molecular characterization
of the cell lines make this information-rich system a valuable
resource (4).
We began early gene expression studies in the NCI-60 with the
measurement of g-ray induction of three genes (5). That study
illustrated the potential for mechanistic insight based on
hypotheses generated from complex data sets. The study identified
a subset of p53 wild-type cell lines with defective GADD45A
induction by g-rays. The drug sensitivity database revealed the
same cell lines to be significantly resistant to topoisomerase II
inhibitors, leading to the ultimate elucidation of a role for Gadd45
in regulating accessibility of damaged chromatin (6). In a
subsequent study (7), we analyzed basal expression levels of 10
genes in the NCI-60 cell lines, finding a striking overall correlation
between sensitivity to 122 chemotherapy agents and expression
levels of BCL2L1 (BCL-XL). The correlation was independent of
growth rate and TP53 status.
More recent studies have compared basal gene expression
patterns across the NCI-60 panel using real-time PCR (8) and
microarrays (9–14). Those studies found that several of the original
tissue-of-origin designations seemed to be incorrect. The tissue
type designations used in this article have been updated
accordingly. MDA-MB-435 and its ERBB2 transfectant, MDA-N,
originally in the breast cancer panel, are now classified as
melanoma cell lines (9, 10). Spectral karyotyping has identified
NCI/ADR, a presumptive breast cancer line, as an ovarian line
derived from OVCAR8 (15, 16).
Most studies of gene expression in the NCI-60 have focused on
basal expression levels. In contrast, our studies have focused on the
gene expression response to stress. We have applied both
quantitative single gene approaches (7, 17) and microarray
profiling to study ionizing radiation (18–20) and other stresses
(21, 22) in human cell lines and primary cells (23, 24). Those studies
revealed an extremely heterogeneous response to radiation among
different cell lines. We speculated that the response of specific
genes to ionizing radiation might correlate with radiation
sensitivity across the genetically diverse NCI-60. Identification of
such genes could lead to development of useful biomarkers for
monitoring the progress of radiation therapy and for predicting
therapeutic effectiveness.

Abstract
The 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute Anticancer
Drug Screen (NCI-60) constitute the most extensively characterized in vitro cancer cell model. They have been tested for
sensitivity to more than 100,000 potential chemotherapy
agents and have been profiled extensively at the DNA, RNA,
protein, functional, and pharmacologic levels. We have used
the NCI-60 cell lines and three additional lines to develop a
database of responses of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. We
compared clonogenic survival, apoptosis, and gene expression
response by microarray. Although several studies have
profiled relative basal gene expression in the NCI-60, this is
the first comparison of large-scale gene expression changes in
response to genotoxic stress. Twenty-two genes were differentially regulated in cells with low survival after 2-Gy ;-rays;
14 genes identified lines more sensitive to 8 Gy. Unlike
reported basal gene expression patterns, changes in expression in response to radiation showed little tissue-of-origin
effect, except for differentiating the lymphoblastoid cell lines
from other cell types. Basal expression patterns, however,
discriminated well between radiosensitive and more resistant
lines, possibly being more informative than radiation
response signatures. The most striking patterns in the
radiation data were a set of genes up-regulated preferentially
in the p53 wild-type lines and a set of cell cycle regulatory
genes down-regulated across the entire NCI-60 panel. The
response of those genes to ;-rays seems to be unaffected by
the myriad of genetic differences across this diverse cell set;
it represents the most penetrant gene expression response to
ionizing radiation yet observed. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):415–24]

Introduction
In the 1980s, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) selected 60 cell
lines representing nine tumor types (breast, central nervous
system, colon, leukemia, lung, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and
renal) and established the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines as a tool

Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. GSE7505),9 in the NCI
Developmental Therapeutics Program database,10 and in CellMiner,11 a
relational database developed for integrative analysis of the NCI-60
profiles at the DNA, RNA, protein, chromosomal, and pharmacologic
levels.
Gene selection and cluster analysis of the log 2-normalized microarray
data were done using the National Human Genome Research Institute
online microarray analysis tools developed jointly with Center for
Information Technology, NIH. Cell lines were ranked by the radiation
response parameters (Table 1) and sensitive or resistant lines for each
parameter were defined by cutting the groups at discontinuities in the data.
The sensitive or resistant groups comprised between 11 and 21 cell lines
(mean, 16). For each parameter, weighted gene analysis (30, 31) was used
to identify genes with significantly different responses in the two groups,
as assessed using four different separation metrics: maximum pairwise
t statistic, distance-based method, Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis statistic, and
class correlation. For each parameter, statistical significance was calculated
by permuting the sample class labels 10,000 times. Only genes with
discriminative power greater than any occurring in the random permutation test using three of the four metrics were included in the final gene
sets (21).
Single-probe hybridizations. Serial dilutions of RNA were immobilized
on nylon membranes, hybridized with cDNA probes at 52jC in Hybrisol I
(Chemicon), and washed under standard conditions. Hybridization was
quantitated on a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics), and relative signal
levels, normalized to the polyadenylate content of each sample, were
determined using the RNA-Think program (32). With that approach, the
values for relative RNA levels are directly proportional to RNA abundance,
and differences z1.5-fold can be identified reliably.
Mitotic index by flow cytometry. TK6 and NH32 cells were irradiated in
exponential phase, and colcemid was added 2 h before fixation of the cells
for collection of mitoses. Aliquots of 2  106 cells were fixed at 20jC in
70% ethanol at times between 4 and 24 h after irradiation, permeabilized,
and stained with Alexa 647–conjugated histone H3 pS28 antibody (BD
PharMingen) following the protocol of the supplier. Cells were resuspended
in propidium iodide (5 Ag/mL) and RNase A (10 Ag/mL) and run on a
FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). At least 20,000 cells were
collected for each point, and mitotic index was scored as the percentage of
cells with G2 DNA content staining positive for phospho-histone H3.
Immunofluorescence. For in situ detection of E2F4, cells were grown
and irradiated on chamber slides, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and
exposed to E2F4 primary antibody (MAB8894, Chemicon) followed by an
Alexa 488–conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) using standard
protocols. Slides were counterstained with propidium iodide and images
were captured with a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 confocal microscope to allow
scoring of at least 100 cells per point in each of three independent
experiments. For individual cells, average E2F4 fluorescence intensity in the
nuclear area (propidium iodide-stained) was quantified with IPLab image
analysis software (Scanalytics, Inc.) and normalized to the overall E2F4
fluorescence intensity of the entire cell.

Here, we present (a) the first microarray studies of gene
expression changes in the NCI-60 (and three additional lymphoblastoid/myeloid cell lines) in response to ionizing radiation and
(b) clonogenic survival experiments that establish radiation
survival curves for those cell lines. We have identified 22 genes
associated with low survival after 2-Gy g-rays, 14 genes associated
with low survival after 8 Gy, and 25 genes with radiation
responses dependent on wild-type p53. The only response
common to all 63 of the cell lines studied was the coordinate
down-regulation of a set of mitosis-associated genes, possibly
regulated by E2F4 and RBL2. The strongly conserved regulation of
those genes across all mutational backgrounds and tissues of
origin suggests a central role in radiation response that should be
explored more fully.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and irradiation. Cell lines from the NCI-60 panel (2, 25)
were obtained from the NCI/Frederick Cancer Research Facility and grown
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were
maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and tested
periodically to ensure absence of Mycoplasma. Suspension lines were
maintained between 1 and 12  105 cells/mL and were irradiated in log
phase at 4  105 to 5  105 cells/mL. Nonsuspension lines were irradiated at
60% to 70% confluence. All cultures were fed with fresh medium the day
before treatment. Cultures were treated with 0 Gy (mock irradiated) or with
1- to 16-Gy g-radiation delivered at 2.9 Gy/min with a Mark I-68 137Cs
source (J.L. Shepherd and Associates, Inc.).
Clonogenic survival. Cells were plated in duplicate p100 dishes at
appropriate dilutions, irradiated, and incubated for colony formation.
Colonies were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with crystal violet, and
colonies of >50 cells were counted. Suspension cells were plated in 96-well
microtiter plates and clonogenic survival was calculated using Poisson
statistics as described (26).
Caspase activation. Cells were exposed to 0, 8, or 16 Gy of g-rays and
incubated for 24 h. Aliquots of 105 cells were used to measure caspase
activity using the CaspSCREEN Flow Cytometric Apoptosis Detection Kit
(BioVision) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
RNA extraction and microarray hybridization. After irradiation,
cultures were incubated for 4 h, and RNA was extracted using a modified
guanidine thiocyanate method followed by purification with RNeasy
columns (Qiagen). Whole-cell RNA (80–100 Ag) was labeled and
hybridized to 6,727-element microarrays, as previously described (18). In
brief, probes were PCR amplified from IMAGE consortium clones and
arrayed on poly-L-lysine–coated glass slides. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA
was prepared from RNA by a single round of reverse transcription
(Superscript II, Invitrogen) in the presence of Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP
(NEN). Probes and targets were hybridized together for 16 to 18 h in
3 SSC at 65jC in the presence of human CoT1 DNA, yeast tRNA,
and polydeoxyadenine. Hybridized slides were washed twice in 0.5 SSC,
0.01% SDS for 5 min, and once in 0.06 SSC for 5 min. The fluorescence
signals from Cy3 and Cy5 were scanned with a laser confocal scanner
(Agilent Technologies) and images were analyzed with the ArraySuite
2.1 extensions in the IPLab program (Scanalytics, Inc.) to calibrate relative
ratios and confidence intervals for their significance (27). The ArraySuite
analysis incorporates four separate metrics of hybridization quality for
each target, taking into account the intensity, background, and other
characteristics of each spot for both fluorochromes. An overall quality
assessment was generated for each target on the array (28) and used for
data filtering. The ratios were normalized to a set of 88 internal controls
with low variation in expression across many kinds of samples (29). The
variance in this housekeeping set was used to determine the significance
of expression changes following irradiation. Up-regulation and downregulation were called at the level of 99% confidence. The microarray data
have been deposited in National Center for Biotechnology Information

Results
Clonogenic survival and apoptosis following exposure to
radiation. Clonogenic survival after exposure to 0, 2, 5, or 8 Gy of
g-rays was measured for the NCI-60 and three additional cell lines.
ML-1, TK6, and NH32 were included in this study because we had
used them in many of our prior radiation and gene expression
studies (17–20, 22) and they therefore provided a link to those
studies. In addition, NH32 is an isogenic derivative of TK6 in which
the p53 gene has been deleted by gene targeting (33). For some cell

The NCI-60: Ionizing Radiation and Gene Expression

We also looked for effects of p53 status on radiation sensitivity
by comparing the SF2 and SF8 in the p53 wild-type and mutant
cell lines (Fig. 1D). Survival did not differ significantly with p53
status at either 2 Gy (Welch’s t test, P = 0.23) or 8 Gy (Welch’s t test,
P = 0.56).
Radiation sensitivity and gene expression. We next looked for
gene expression signatures related to measurements of radiation
sensitivity, identifying 22 genes (FDR, 4.2%) that distinguished the
cell lines with low survival following exposure to 2-Gy g-rays (SF2 <
0.2). Fourteen genes (FDR, 10%) predicted low survival following
8 Gy (SF8 < 0.001), five of those also being in the SF2 gene set. For D 0,
we found only seven genes (FDR 13.3%) that predicted radiation
sensitivity (D 0 < 90 cGy). Five of those genes were also in the SF2 set.
The findings are summarized in Table 2, where overlap with genes in
the lymphoid cell line response signature is also indicated.
In contrast to sensitivity, the only parameter for which genes
were found to predict the more resistant cell lines was the
extrapolation number (n). As a measure of the shoulder on the
survival curve, a large n is generally held to represent higher levels
of DNA repair. We found 18 genes (Supplementary Table S2; FDR,
10.6%) for which increased expression after irradiation distinguished the cell lines with large shoulders (n > 10). Although those
genes were not significantly enriched with DNA repair genes, it was
notable that the known X-ray damage repair gene XRCC1 was
selected at the highest level of significance by all methods used.
Other radiation response parameters from Table 1 [caspase
activation, doubling time, and G2 checkpoint deficit from O’Connor
et al. (35)] were tested for predictive genes. No genes were
identified by more than two statistical methods as significantly
distinguishing cell lines with high or low measurements for any of
those parameters.
Coordinate decreased expression of mitosis-associated
genes. Although no genes were up-regulated by ionizing radiation
across all of the diverse cell lines in this study, a cluster of
genes was broadly down-regulated across essentially the entire
panel (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Gene Ontology analysis of the genes in that cluster using the
EASE algorithm (36) revealed a highly significant overrepresentation of genes involved in mitosis (Bonferroni-corrected EASE score,
1.8  1022), cytokinesis (2.9  1012), mitotic spindle components
(8.2  106), and protein serine/threonine kinases (3.2  104).
We compared the effects of 8 Gy of g-rays on mitotic index and
expression of several of the genes from the down-regulated cluster
(PLK1, AURKA, CENPA, and PPP2R5A). Within 4 h of radiation
exposure, there was a rapid reduction in mitotic index and in
expression of all four genes. Gene expression then recovered
rapidly, and by 24 h after exposure, all four genes were expressed at
or near pre-exposure levels. In contrast, the mitotic index of the
cells remained strongly suppressed (Fig. 2B).
We next searched the BIND protein interaction database to
retrieve all reported interactions involving the products of the
genes in the down-regulated cluster and constructed a Cytoscape
interaction map (ref. 37; Fig. 2C). The map revealed a large
potential regulatory node containing many of the most strongly
and consistently suppressed genes (marked region in Fig. 2A).
A majority of those genes have reported interactions with the E2F4
and RBL2 transcription factors, and many also with E2F1 and
TAF1. TAF1 was up-regulated at the mRNA level by microarray in
about a quarter of the cell lines.
Western blots showed slight up-regulation of E2F4 protein
by ionizing radiation, but the effect was not consistently

lines, dose points at 1 and 6 Gy were added to clarify the shape of
the survival curve. D 0 and extrapolation number (n), two variables
commonly used to describe the shape of survival curves (34), were
calculated. D 0 is the dose required to reduce survival by 37%
(a factor of e) in the linear part of the curve. The extrapolation
number, a measure of the initial shoulder of the survival curve, is
the y-intercept obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the
curve back to the axis. Surviving fractions at 2 Gy (SF2), 5 Gy (SF5),
and 8 Gy (SF8), as well as the calculated parameters, are reported
in Table 1.
Caspase activity was determined by flow cytometry as a measure
of apoptosis induction. As expected, many of the nonmyeloid/
lymphoid cell lines showed little or no apoptotic response in the
first 24 h. Caspase activity levels at that time after 8- and 16-Gy
g-ray doses relative to untreated controls are reported in Table 1.
Changes of z1.9-fold were considered significant (P < 0.001).
Microarray analysis. Gene expression responses to 8 Gy of g-rays
were measured by hybridization to 6,728-element cDNA microarrays. The data were filtered using minimum intensity-of-hybridization and quality control requirements as described in Materials
and Methods, yielding a set of 5,186 genes. To reduce noise and
lighten the computational load during analyses, that set was further
filtered by requiring significant up-regulation or down-regulation
(ratios outside the 99% confidence interval of the housekeeping
genes on the array) in at least 10% of the cell lines to eliminate
the most nonresponsive genes from analysis. That sequence of
steps yielded a set of 990 potentially radiation-responsive genes
(Supplementary Table S1) that was used in subsequent analyses.
Gene expression responses by tissue of origin. Basal gene
expression levels in the NCI-60 cell lines were previously found to
be strongly correlated with the tissue of origin (9, 14). Although the
use of untreated controls for each cell line to obtain response ratios
should have removed the basal tissue-of-origin effect, the response
to radiation could still have differed between cell lines originating
from different tissues. We therefore examined the radiation
response data for such a tissue-dependence. In contrast to basal
gene expression, the changes in expression in response to radiation
did not differ coherently as a function of tissue of origin. The
clearest tissue-specific signature was for cells of lymphoid/myeloid
origin. Weighted gene analysis (30, 31) was used to identify a set of
21 radiation-responsive genes [false discovery rate (FDR), 4.3%]
that discriminated between those cell lines and all others (Table 2).
That gene set included only genes with significantly different
radiation response ratios (empirical P < 0.005) in the two groups as
determined by at least three of the four test methods (maximum
pairwise t statistic, distance-based method, Wilcoxon/KruskalWallis statistic, and class correlation).
Gene responses and p53 status. Because p53 status is known
to be a major determinant of gene expression responses to ionizing
radiation, we next looked for genes that responded differently in
the p53 mutant and wild-type lines. We identified 25 radiationresponsive genes that were dependent on p53 status across the 63
lines studied (FDR, 1.6%; Fig. 1A). Multidimensional scaling (MDS)
based on that set of genes produced a clear grouping of the p53
wild-type lines (Fig. 1B). A literature search revealed that 15 of
the 25 genes identified have previously been reported to respond
to ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner. We then used
the p53 wild-type cell line TK6 and its p53-null derivative, NH32,
to confirm both the radiation induction and dependence on p53
status of PHLDA3 and PLK3 (Fig. 1C), two of the radiationresponsive genes from the p53-discriminating signature.

Discussion

One of the most consistently induced genes among the p53
wild-type lines was PHLDA3. We have previously observed large
inductions of PHLDA3 in p53 wild-type cells treated with UV
radiation (21) and a number of other DNA-damaging agents
including ionizing radiation (22). Despite its robust induction in
many cell lines, PHLDA3 has not been previously described as a
radiation response gene. We have now confirmed its p53dependent induction by ionizing radiation. PHLDA3 has been
implicated in apoptosis (38), but its role in radiation response
remains uncharacterized.
In different model systems, wild-type p53 has been reported to
both increase and decrease radiation sensitivity and clinical
response (reviewed in ref. 39). In the sulforhodamine B assay of
the NCI-60 screen, wild-type p53 status has also been associated
with drug sensitivity for many mechanisms of action but not for
antimitotics (4, 35). In the present study, p53 status did not seem to

The p53 response has been found to play a central role in most
studies of radiation-induced gene expression, making it an
important parameter to examine here. Consistent with our previous
studies of gene expression after ionizing radiation, the most strongly
up-regulated genes in the NCI-60 responded preferentially in p53
wild-type cell lines. Our analysis identified 25 such p53-dependent
genes. Many more genes have been reported to be p53 regulated, but
it is not surprising that we found only a subset of those. Multiple
regulatory factors contribute to gene expression and vary among cell
lines, decreasing the ability to see p53 dependence with statistical
significance. For example, GADD45A is known to be induced by
radiation in a p53-dependent manner, but this response is deficient
in a subset of NCI-60 lines (5). That heterogeneity of response means
that GADD45A did not meet the significance requirements for
p53-dependent response across the entire cell panel.

triggers cell cycle checkpoints to block cells from entering mitosis,
the apparent suppression of those genes could simply reflect
changes in cell cycle distribution. If such were the case, suppression
of mitosis-associated genes might be expected to correlate with
growth rate because a greater relative effect should be seen in cell
lines normally having a greater proportion of cells in M phase.
However, only two of the down-regulated genes, CCNB1 and
CENPF, showed significant correlation with doubling time (P <
0.01). For all of the other genes in the mitosis cluster, downregulation by ionizing radiation was independent of doubling time

be a significant determinant of radiation sensitivity in the NCI-60,
suggesting that, although manipulations of p53 may alter
radiosensitivity in specific model systems, the general loss of p53
in human cancer cells does not contribute consistently to radioresistance. Tumor cells have evolved diverse survival mechanisms,
and many genotypic or phenotypic factors other than p53 likely
combine to determine radiosensitivity.
The coordinate down-regulation across the entire NCI-60 panel
of genes associated with mitosis was the most striking pattern of
gene expression response to ionizing radiation. Because radiation

found that three of the nine SF2 classifier genes from Torres-Roca
et al. (45), RPIA, NASP, and SFRS1, were also identified by our SF2
analysis. In contrast, there was no overlap between that previous
SF2 classifier and either our SF8 or D 0 basal prediction set. The
large number of genes whose basal expression levels are associated
with radiation sensitivity parameters and the relatively clear
separation of cell lines visualized by MDS (Fig. 3) suggest that
profiles of basal gene expression contain as much or more
information about radiation sensitivity as do gene expression
responses to radiation. That observation is consistent with the
finding that basal gene expression often correlates with chemosensitivity (4, 10–12). The two types of measurement are complementary. Basal expression addresses most directly the question
of sensitivity and resistance; expression changes in response to a
perturbation address most directly the question of downstream
consequences.
Because p53 status yielded some of the clearest results with the
radiation-response ratio data, we also looked in the U133 data set
for genes with basal expression levels that differed as a function of
p53 status. In contrast with the radiation survival parameters, for
which more genes were identified in the basal expression data set,
we identified only two genes (FDR 4.6%), CDKN1A and BAX, with
basal expression that differed as a function of p53. Because not all

(median P = 0.33), suggesting that gene regulation, rather than cell
cycle redistribution alone, is involved. That suggestion was
strengthened by the lack of temporal coupling between changes
in mitotic index and expression of genes in the cluster (PLK1,
AURKA, CENPA, and PPP2R5A). Although gene expression and
mitotic index decreased with similar initial kinetics, gene
expression levels recovered independently of reentry of cells into
M phase. That finding again implies regulation rather than mere
loss of cells in mitosis.
Mapping of known DNA interactions with the promoters of the
mitosis genes revealed a potential regulatory network centered on
the transcription factors E2F4, RBL2, E2F1, and TAF1. TAF1 and
E2F1 generally act as activating transcription factors and may
participate in normal expression of the mitosis genes in
undamaged cycling cells. E2F4 and RBL2 (the p130 retinoblastoma-like protein), however, act together as a repressor complex
to prevent gene transcription (40). Hence, they are proteins of
particular interest in the context of the down-regulated mitosis
gene cluster. The loss or down-regulation of E2F4 also sensitizes
cells to killing by chemotherapy agents (41) and radiation (42, 43),
further suggesting a role in radiation response.
Induction of E2F4 protein has been reported 8 to 24 h after
irradiation of prostate, but not breast cancer, cell lines (42). E2F4
activity can also be regulated by changes in subcellular localization
during normal cell cycle progression (44) and in response to
ionizing radiation (42, 43). Because gene expression changes in our
study were assessed 4 h post-irradiation, we looked for effects on
E2F4 at that time. We found significant increases in nuclear E2F4
staining coincident with gene down-regulation in the four cell
lines tested. The lack of protein induction in MCF7 cells assayed
24 h after treatment in the prior study contrasts with our finding of
nuclear localization and gene down-regulation at 4 h in the same
cell line. Protein induction and changes in protein localization do
not necessarily represent the same response pathway, however.
It seems that nuclear localization and resulting transcriptional
suppression represent a conserved early response to radiation
damage, whereas changes in protein expression may contribute to
later effects and be less tightly conserved among cell lines or tumor
types.
Several prior studies have profiled basal gene expression levels in
the NCI-60 without genotoxic stress and found correlations with
drug sensitivity (10–14) and tissue of origin (9). A recent study of 35
of the NCI-60 lines by Torres-Roca et al. (45) also identified basal
gene expression predictors of SF2 values after ionizing radiation.
Of the nine genes selected in that study, none were among the
27 radiation response genes that distinguish between sensitive and
resistant cell lines across the entire NCI-60 in the present study.
This implies that genes with basal expression levels that correlate
with radiosensitivity do not necessarily respond to radiation with
additional changes in expression levels.
To see how application of our methods to the measured survival
and basal data for the whole NCI-60 panel would compare with the
previous classifier results (45), Affymetrix U133 measurements of
basal expression levels (processed by Robust Multichip Analysis;
ref. 14) were subjected to the same analysis as our radiation
response data. The same criteria as applied to our radiation data
yielded 175 genes that identified cell lines with low SF2 (FDR, 1.8%),
98 for lines with low SF8 (FDR, 1.7%), and 19 for lines with low D 0
(FDR, 2.8%; Supplementary Table S4). Despite the use of very
different methods (binary class comparison rather than continuous
classifiers and the entire set of 60 cell lines, rather than 35 lines), we

response will best be determined by direct measurement of such
values.
From the present study, it seems that some radiation-induced
changes in gene expression can be associated with measured
radiation survival parameters but that the basal gene expression
pattern before irradiation may be a better predictor of radiation
sensitivity. Up-regulation of the p53 pathway represents the
most prominent, coherent induced gene pattern in the NCI-60
panel. In contrast, the joint down-regulation of expression of
genes involved in mitosis seems to represent a pathway of
radiation response broadly conserved among cancer cell lines.
Involvement of the E2F4-RBL2 complex as a down-regulator of
that pathway suggests that it is an important component,
hitherto largely overlooked, of the response to radiation and
that it is a possible attractive drug target for enhancement of
radiotherapy.

genes that are radiation inducible by p53 are regulated by p53 in
the absence of stress, such a result is not entirely unreasonable.
Interestingly, in our earlier study comparing basal expression of
10 genes in the NCI-60 (eight with known p53-dependent stress
regulation), we found that only CDKN1A (P = 0.002) and BAX
(P = 0.003) had basal expression levels correlating significantly with
p53 status (7).
Given the strong contribution of basal gene expression levels to
cellular radiation response, we wondered if the absolute expression levels post-irradiation would also be informative. We
therefore reconstructed approximate post-irradiation levels for
the genes present in both our response ratio data and the
Affymetrix basal expression data, yielding a set of 4,617 genes.
From that set, we were able to identify 31 genes that identified cell
lines with SF8 <0.001, and 29 genes that identified lines with SF2
<0.2. Those gene sets did not improve the separation of the groups
by MDS, however, and the basal signatures still seemed the most
powerful. There was also little overlap between the gene sets
selected from the reconstructed values and the corresponding
basal or radiation-response ratio sets. Post-irradiation levels of
three genes, CDKN1A, BCL2A1, and F3, correlated with p53 status.
No relationships could be found between the reconstructed gene
expression levels and any of the other parameters tested. It is
possible, however, that the amount of noise introduced by merging
the two very different types of microarray measurements overwhelmed most structure within the reconstructed data set. The
role of absolute post-irradiation gene expression levels in radiation
