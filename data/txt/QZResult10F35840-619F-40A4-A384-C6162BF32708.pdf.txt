Free Tubulin Modulates Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
in Cancer Cells
Eduardo N. Maldonado, Jyoti Patnaik, Matthew R. Mullins, and John J. Lemasters

Abstract
Formation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DY) depends on flux of respiratory substrates, ATP,
ADP, and Pi through voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC). As tubulin promotes single-channel closure of
VDAC, we hypothesized that tubulin is a dynamic regulator of DY, which in cultured cancer cells was assessed by
confocal microscopy of the potential-indicating fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM).
Microtubule destabilizers, rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole, and the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel
increased and decreased cellular free tubulin, respectively, and in parallel decreased and increased DY. Protein
kinase A (PKA) activation by cAMP analogues and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK-3b) inhibition decreased
DY, whereas PKA inhibition hyperpolarized, consistent with reports that PKA and GSK-3b decrease and increase
VDAC conductance, respectively. Plasma membrane potential assessed by DiBAC4(3) was not altered by any of
the treatments. We propose that inhibition of VDAC by free tubulin limits mitochondrial metabolism in cancer
cells. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10192–201. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant cancer cells typically display high rates of glycolysis even when fully oxygenated (1, 2). In aerobic tissues,
glycolysis contributes only 5% of cellular ATP production. In
cancer cells, high glycolytic rates and net formation of pyruvate and lactate persist despite adequate oxidation, as confirmed in cancer patients by positron emission tomography of
the glucose analogue 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (3). Enhanced
glycolysis in tumor cells accounting for 50% to 70% of ATP
formation may be advantageous for rapid growing tumors
exceeding their blood and oxygen supply (4). Furthermore,
glycolysis although less efficient may still produce ATP faster
than oxidative phosphorylation, an advantage to rapidly dividing cells, including strongly glycolytic embryonic and early
fetal tissues (5). Additionally, byproducts and intermediates of
glycolytic metabolism are precursors for anabolic biosynthesis
(6). The Warburg phenomenon seems to be more than an
epiphenomenon, as enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation and/or inhibition of glycolysis (e.g., dichloroacetic acid,

3-bromopyruvate) cause tumor cell death both in vitro and in
vivo (4).
In mitochondria, transport of respiratory substrates, ATP,
ADP, and phosphate across the mitochondrial inner membrane occurs through a variety of specific transporters. In
contrast, metabolite exchange across the outer membrane
occurs primarily through the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; refs. 7–9), which is a highly conserved approximately 30-kDa protein that forms channels permeable to
molecules up to approximately 5 kDa for nonelectrolytes in
the fully open state (10, 11). Each VDAC protein forms a barrel
composed of a transmembrane alpha helix and 13 or more
transmembrane beta strands that enclose an aqueous channel
of approximately 3 nm in internal diameter in the open state
and 1.8 nm in the closed state (12, 13).
VDAC shows both ion selectivity and voltage dependence.
In the open state, selectivity favoring anions over cations is
weak. Both positive and negative membrane potentials (50
mV) close VDAC. It remains controversial if membrane
potential regulates VDAC conductance in intact cells (14).
Nonetheless, VDAC closure effectively blocks movement of
most organic anions, including respiratory substrates and
creatine phosphate, and prevents exchange of ADP and Pi
for ATP during oxidative phosphorylation (15). Recently,
VDAC closure was hypothesized to contribute to suppression
of mitochondrial metabolism in the Warburg phenomenon
(16).
Other factors regulate VDAC gating, including glutamate
(17), NADH (18), VDAC modulator (19), G-actin (20), hexokinase (21–23), and Bcl2 family members (24). Protein kinases,
including protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase 3b (GSK3b) and protein kinase C epsilon, are reported to phosphorylate VDAC (25–27). Purified VDAC1 is a substrate for PKA in
vitro, and PKA phosphorylation of VDAC blocks or inhibits

association of VDAC with proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax
and tBid. Moreover, PKA-dependent VDAC phosphorylation
decreases VDAC conductance (28). In contrast, GSK-3b–
mediated VDAC phosphorylation seems to promote channel
opening and potentiate chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity
(25, 29). VDAC closure has also been reported to occur after
acute treatment of hepatocytes with ethanol (16, 30).
Tubulin, the heterodimeric subunit of microtubules, binds to
mitochondria specifically at VDAC (31, 32). Nanomolar concentrations of dimeric tubulin close VDAC reconstituted into
planar phospholipid membranes (33). Tubulin also decreases
outer membrane permeability to adenine nucleotides in isolated brain mitochondria and in permeabilized synaptosomes
and cardiac myocytes (33, 34). These effects of tubulin are
enhanced when VDAC is phosphorylated by PKA (35).
Here, we evaluated the role of tubulin in regulating mitochondrial function in intact HepG2 human hepatoma cells.
Our results indicate that microtubule depolymerization with
colchicine, nocodazole, and rotenone leads to partial mitochondrial depolarization, whereas a decrease of free tubulin
induced by paclitaxel promotes hyperpolarization. Additionally, the PKA agonists dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-CPT-cAMP promote depolarization, whereas PKA inhibition by H89 causes
hyperpolarization. In contrast, GSK-3b inhibition with
SB216763, SB415286, or 1-azakenpaullone causes depolarization. Microtubule destabilization also causes mitochondrial
depolarization in human A549 lung carcinoma and UM-SCC-1
head and neck cancer cells, whereas microtubule stabilization
promotes mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In rat hepatocytes, microtubule depolymerization also depolarizes mitochondria but microtubule stabilization does not
hyperpolarize. These results are consistent with the conclusion that free tubulin and protein kinases dynamically regulate
mitochondrial function in cancer cells but not in nontransformed primary cells, possibly by altering VDAC conductance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HepG2, A549, and UM-SCC-1 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium,
F-12K medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(high glucose), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2/air at 37 C. Cancer cells used for experiments were maintained in culture for less than 3 months.
Confocal microscopy of cells cultured on glass bottom culture
dishes (MatTek) for 48 hours was conducted in 5% CO2/air at
37 C either in modified Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS)
containing (in mmol/L): NaCl 137, Na2HPO4 0.35, KCl 5.4,
KH2PO4 1, MgSO4 0.81, Ca2Cl 0.95, glucose 5.5, NaHCO3 25, and
HEPES 20, pH 7.4, or complete growth medium.
Hepatocyte isolation and culture
Rat hepatocytes were isolated from overnight fasted male
Sprague–Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion, as
described previously (36). Cell viability exceeded 90%. Hepatocytes were cultured overnight in plates or glass bottom

dishes coated with type 1 rat tail collagen in Waymouth's MB
752/1 medium containing 27 mmol/L NaHCO3, 2 mmol/L Lglutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 nmol/L insulin, and 10
nmol/L dexamethasone.
Loading of fluorescent probes
Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) accumulates
electrophoretically into mitochondria in response to the negative mitochondrial DY (37). Cells in HBSS or complete growth
medium were loaded 30 minutes at 37 C with 200 nmol/l
TMRM. After loading and washing, subsequent incubations
were conducted with 50 nmol/L TMRM to maintain equilibrium distribution of the fluorophore (38). For simultaneous
determination of plasma membrane and mitochondrial DY,
HepG2 cells were coloaded with 500 nmol/L bis-1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid-trimethine oxonol [DiBAC4(3)] and 200 nmol/L
TMRM for 30 minutes and examined without washing.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy
Cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser
scanning confocal microscope (Thornwood) with a 63 1.4 N.
A. planapochromat oil immersion lens using 543-nm HeNe
laser (0.5%–1.5% full power) and 488-nm Ar laser (0.2%–0.3%
power) excitation, respectively. Emitted red fluorescence of
TMRM was detected through a 560-nm long-pass filter and a 1
Airy unit diameter pinhole and emitted green fluorescence of
DiBAC4 (3) was detected through a 500- to 530-nm barrier
filter and 10.6 Airy unit pinhole. Focal planes for each field
were selected that showed nuclei as black structures with
regular borders without superimposed mitochondria.
Assessment of free and polymerized tubulins
Free and polymerized tubulin fractions were assessed using
a Microtubules/Tubulin In Vivo Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton). Cells
were homogenized in cell lysis and microtubule stabilization
buffer containing (in mmol/L): MgCl2 5, EGTA 1, GTP 0.1, ATP
1, and PIPES buffer 100; and (in %): glycerol 30, Nonidet-P40
0.1, Triton X-100 0.1, Tween-20 0.1, beta-mercaptoethanol 0.1,
antifoam 0.001, and BME 0.2, pH 7.4, with a protease inhibitor
cocktail. Homogenates were centrifuged (100,000  g, 30
minutes, 37 C) to yield supernatants containing free tubulin
and pellets containing microtubules, which were resuspended
in cold 200 mmol/L CaCl2.
Free tubulin and microtubule tubulin fractions were loaded
on 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels. Proteins were transferred using an
iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked in
5% nonfat milk and probed with 1:1,000 anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Cytoskeleton) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Immunoblots were detected by 1:3,000 secondary antibodies
conjugated to peroxidase (goat anti-mouse IgG.HRP: Sc-2005;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Detection was conducted using a chemiluminescence kit
(Supersignal Westpico Chemiluminescent Substrate). Protein
was quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).
Image analysis
TMRM and DiBAC4(3) fluorescence was quantified using
Zeiss LSM (Carl Zeiss GmbH) and Photoshop CS4 (Adobe

Systems) software. Briefly, images were taken from cells grown
to 70%–80% confluency. For each preparation and treatment,
a minimum of 4 random fields containing about 5 to 10 cells
was selected for quantitative analysis. Images shown in the
figures are representative of these fields. All cells from each
field were outlined, and the mean intensity of fluorescence
was determined by histogram analysis of the red or green
channel, as appropriate. Background values were obtained
from images collected while focusing within the coverslip and
were subtracted from the mean cellular fluorescence of each
field. Mean intensity of cellular fluorescence after background
subtraction indicated relative cellular uptake of red-fluorescing TMRM or green-fluorescing DiBAC4(3). Control experiments were conducted by treating the cells with the same
concentration of vehicle used to deliver drugs. Otherwise, the
experimental conditions were identical. A minimum of 3
independent experiments were used to make final calculations.
Statistics
Differences between groups were analyzed by the Student's
t test using P < 0.05 as the criterion of significance. Results
were expressed as means  SEM. Images are representative of
3 or more experiments.

Results
HepG2 cells maintain mitochondrial DY through
respiration or ATP hydrolysis
HepG2 cells at approximately 70% confluency were loaded
with TMRM and imaged by confocal microscopy. Red fluorescence revealed round and filamentous mitochondria relatively densely packed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1).

image was collected after 20 minutes. Oligomycin (10 mg/mL) was
then added, and additional images were collected after 30 minutes.

tory inhibitor, decreased TMRM fluorescence by 8% indicating a small drop of mitochondrial DY (Fig. 1). To test the
hypothesis that ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial F1F0ATP synthase operating in reverse was maintaining mitochondrial DY in the presence of myxothiazol, oligomycin (10
mg/mL), a specific F1-F0 ATP synthase inhibitor, was subsequently added. As expected, oligomycin in the presence of
myxothiazol collapsed DY nearly completely (Fig. 1). Notably, changes of mitochondrial DY after myxothiazol plus
oligomycin did not affect cell shape (Fig. 1). When oligomycin was added first, TMRM fluorescence increased by 93%
and then was lost nearly completely after subsequent myxothiazol (data not shown). These results indicate that mitochondria of HepG2 cells are metabolically active and
catalyzing DY formation and ATP synthesis driven by
respiration and that ATP hydrolysis after respiratory inhibition can also sustain DY.
Rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole decrease
mitochondrial DY
To further investigate the effect of respiratory inhibitors on
mitochondrial DY, we exposed HepG2 cells to rotenone, an
inhibitor of complex I, which like myxothiazol inhibits respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, rotenone
decreased TMRM fluorescence by about 60% (Fig. 2A). The
decrease of DY plateaued within 30 minutes and further
changes after up to an hour did not occur (data not shown).
In control experiments, mitochondrial DY remained
unchanged for an hour after vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide; data
not shown). Rotenone also caused cell rounding with partial
and sometimes complete detachment of cells. Cell rounding
after rotenone paralleled mitochondrial depolarization and
did not occur after myxothiazol or vehicle (Fig. 2A compared
with Fig. 1, data not shown).
Because previous studies show that rotenone depolymerizes microtubules and increases free tubulin in cells
(39, 40), we examined the effects of 2 structurally unrelated
microtubule destabilizers, colchicine and nocodazole, on
TMRM fluorescence and cell morphology. Colchicine (10
mmol/L) decreased mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence by
60% and promoted cell rounding and detachment similar
to rotenone (Fig. 2B). Nocodazole (10 mmol/L) caused virtually
identical changes (Fig 2C). Thus, each of the structurally
distinct microtubule destabilizers studied caused mitochondrial DY to decrease.
Microtubule stabilization by paclitaxel hyperpolarizes
mitochondria and prevents the decrease of
mitochondrial DY produced by rotenone, colchicine,
and nocodazole
To assess whether changes of DY were specifically dependent on free tubulin inside cells, we treated HepG2 cells with
the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel (41). After paclitaxel (10
mmol/L), TMRM fluorescence increased 60% within 30 minutes and cell morphology was preserved (Fig. 2D). Moreover,
paclitaxel prevented loss of mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence when cells were subsequently treated with rotenone,
colchicine, or nocodazole (Fig. 2A–C).

Free Tubulin Modulates Mitochondrial Membrane Potential

Figure 2. Rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole depolarize mitochondria in HepG2 cells, which were loaded with TMRM, as described in Fig. 1.
A, baseline cells (left) were exposed to rotenone (Rot, 2 mmol/L) for 30 minutes (middle). Another dish of cells was pretreated with paclitaxel (Ptx, 10 mmol/L)
for 20 minutes before addition of rotenone (2 mmol/L; right). B and C, cells were treated identically as in (A), except colchicine (Col, 10 mmol/L) and
nocodazole (Ncz, 10 mmol/L), respectively, were substituted for rotenone. D, cells were treated with paclitaxel for 20 minutes. Note the decrease in
TMRM fluorescence and cell rounding after rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole treatment. Paclitaxel causes TMRM fluorescence to increase and
prevents the decrease of TMRM fluorescence and cell rounding after rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole treatment.

Mitochondrial depolarization/hyperpolarization
follows the ratio of free to polymerized tubulins
Changes of tubulin polymerization in HepG2 cells in
response to various treatments were determined by Western
blots. In untreated cells, the free to polymerized tubulin ratio
was approximately 5 (Fig. 3A). After treatment with rotenone,
colchicine, and nocodazole, free to polymerize tubulin ratios
increased to 60, 78, and 58, respectively. In contrast, after
paclitaxel, the ratio decreased to 0.3. Moreover, pretreatment
with paclitaxel prevented microtubule depolymerization by
rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole. Myxothiazol unlike
rotenone caused almost no change of the free to polymerized
tubulin ratio (Fig. 3A). These results, compared with the
results of Figure 2A–D, show a strong inverse correlation
between the free to polymerized tubulin ratios and mitochondrial DY measured by TMRM fluorescence (Fig. 3B).
Microtubule-depolymerizing agents do not change
plasma membrane potential
TMRM uptake into mitochondria is driven by both mitochondrial and plasma membrane DY. To exclude that plasma

membrane depolarization was causing mitochondrial TMRM
release after microtubule-depolymerizing agents, we measured plasma membrane DY with DiBAC4(3), which is an
anionic fluorophore that intercalates into membranes enhancing fluorescence. Highly negative plasma membrane DY
excludes DiBAC4(3) from cells, and fluorescence is low. In
contrast, plasma membrane depolarization promotes
DiBAC4(3) uptake increasing fluorescence as evidenced by
depolarization induced by high Kþ (Fig. 4). DiBAC4(3) fluorescence remained unchanged after exposure of HepG2 cells to
colchicine, nocodazole, and rotenone (Fig. 4). Thus, decreased
plasma membrane potential cannot account for loss of TMRM
fluorescence after exposure of HepG2 cells to microtubuledepolymerizing agents.
cAMP-dependent PKA activation decreases
mitochondrial DY, whereas PKA inhibition
increases DY
PKA phosphorylates VDAC, and conductance of VDAC
phosphorylated by PKA is more sensitive to inhibition by
tubulin (28, 35). Accordingly, we assessed the effect on

cAMP, H89 also reversed mitochondrial depolarization when
added after the cAMP analogues (data not shown). Inhibition and activation of PKA did not alter plasma membrane
DY, because DiBAC4(3) fluorescence remained unchanged
after exposure of cells to dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mmol/L), 8pCPT-cAMP, and H89 (Supplementary Fig. S1). DiBAC4(3)
fluorescence also remained unchanged after GSK-3b inhibition (see below; Supplementary Fig. S1).

and 8-pCPT-cAMP decreased TMRM fluorescence by 45%
and 41%, respectively, within 20 minutes without causing
cell rounding or detachment (Fig. 5A, B, and D). Okadaic
acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that indirectly promotes protein phosphorylation, also decreased TMRM fluorescence by
50% (Fig. 5C and D). In contrast, H89 (1 mmol/L) at a

mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence by 71% (Fig. 5D). H89treated cells remained hyperpolarized even after subsequent

blocking depolarization by dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-pCPT-

GSK-3b inhibition decreases mitochondrial DY
In contrast to PKA, GSK-3b is reported to promote VDAC
opening (25). Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of the GSK3b inhibitors SB216763 (400 nmol/L), 1-azakenpaullone (1
mmol/L), and SB415286 (1 mmol/L) on mitochondrial TMRM
fluorescence in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6A). Each inhibitor caused a
45% to 55% decrease in TMRM fluorescence (Fig. 6B). These
results are consistent with the conclusion that GSK-3b regulates mitochondrial DY oppositely to PKA.
In complete growth medium, depolarization after
nocodazole and dibutyryl-cAMP treatment is
diminished whereas paclitaxel and PKA inhibition still
induce hyperpolarization
To assess the possibility that effects of free tubulin on
mitochondrial DY are a consequence of cell incubation in
serum-, amino acid-, and growth factor–free HBSS, we evaluated the effect of microtubule destabilization/stabilization in
HepG2 cells incubated in complete growth medium (Eagle's
minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum). In
complete growth medium, nocodazole decreased TMRM
fluorescence (23%), although to a somewhat lesser extent
than in HBSS (Fig. 7A and C). However, dibutyryl-cAMP
had little effect on TMRM fluorescence (data not shown).
In contrast, paclitaxel increased TMRM fluorescence by 108%
over baseline even in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP (Fig. 7B
and C). Similarly, PKA inhibition by H89 increased TMRM
fluorescence by 61% (Supplementary Fig. S2). In control
experiments, vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) did not change
mitochondrial DY (Supplementary Fig. S3). These findings

After confirming that free tubulin dynamically modulates
DY in HepG2 cells, we extended our study to A549 and UMSCC-1 cancer cell lines incubated in their respective growth

lack of response to paclitaxel may reflect higher polymerized
tubulin and lower free tubulin in hepatocytes than in the
cancer cell lines studied (Supplementary Fig. S4; see also
Fig. 3). Thus, although tubulin depolymerization impaired
mitochondrial DY formation in primary hepatocytes,
increased tubulin polymerization with paclitaxel and PKA
inhibition did not increase DY. These findings were
consistent with the conclusion that free tubulin is not
dynamically controlling mitochondrial DY in primary rat
hepatocytes.

Discussion
Cancer cells generate the bulk of their ATP by glycolysis
even in the presence of oxygen, although mitochondria isolated from tumor cells are functional (44). In confirmation, our
work showed that polarized mitochondria of HepG2, A549,
and UM-SCC-1 cells took up the potential-indicating fluor-

ophore TMRM. Moreover, respiration and ATP hydrolysis
were each individually sufficient to maintain mitochondrial
polarization, as the combination of myxothiazol and oligomycin, but neither agent alone, was required to depolarize
mitochondria and release TMRM fluorescence from HepG2
cells consistent with expectations of chemiosmotic theory
(Fig. 1).
Although myxothiazol alone did not depolarize HepG2
mitochondria, rotenone, another respiratory inhibitor, did
depolarize and caused cell rounding (Fig. 2A). Rotenone,
unlike myxothiazol, inhibits microtubule polymerization in
addition to causing respiratory inhibition (39, 40). To determine whether rotenone-induced mitochondrial depolarization was related to microtubule depolymerization, we
destabilized microtubules with colchicine and nocodazole
in HepG2 cells. Both colchicine and nocodazole caused cellular rounding and TMRM release to virtually the same extent
as rotenone (Fig. 2B and C). In contrast, the microtubulestabilizing agent paclitaxel increased TMRM uptake and prevented loss of TMRM fluorescence after rotenone, colchicine,
and nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2A–C). Measurement of free
and polymerized tubulins confirmed a very strong inverse
relationship between free to polymerized tubulin ratios and
mitochondrial DY (Fig. 3B).
Plasma membrane DY also drives TMRM uptake into cells,
increasing TMRM uptake into mitochondria. To determine
whether fluctuations of plasma membrane DY changed
TMRM fluorescence after microtubule destabilization/stabilization, we examined cells loaded with DiBAC4(3), a plasma
membrane potential indicator. Rotenone, colchicine, nocodazole, or paclitaxel did not alter DiBAC4(3) fluorescence,
although it increased as expected after plasma membrane
depolarization by high Kþ (Fig. 4). Thus, microtubule destabilization/stabilization did not change plasma membrane DY
but specifically altered mitochondrial DY.
Microtubules are involved in diverse cellular functions,
including motility, maintenance of cell shape, cell division,
and organelle distribution (45). Microtubules form by side-toside self-association of tubulin, a heterodimer of a-tubulin and
b-tubulin (46). Specific interactions of microtubules with
mitochondria mediate intracellular movement of mitochondria, for example, during axoplasmic transport (31, 32). Recent
studies show that tubulin reversibly inhibits VDAC reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes and decreases
respiration in isolated mitochondria. This inhibition seems
mediated by insertion of a negatively charged extended Cterminal tail of tubulin into the VDAC channel (33). Our
findings showing that free tubulin regulates mitochondrial
DY are consistent with the conclusion that free tubulin is also
inhibiting VDAC in situ and regulating the supply of
respiratory substrates and/or ATP required for mitochondrial
polarization. Our data also suggest that tubulin is dynamically
regulating VDAC in cancer cells, because an increase of free
tubulin caused depolarization whereas a decrease caused
hyperpolarization.
Previous studies indicate that PKA-mediated phosphorylation leads to VDAC closure whereas GSK-3b activity promotes
VDAC opening (25,28). Thus, to further assess whether

cells incubated in HBSS whereas H89, a highly specific PKA
inhibitor, blocked and reversed the effect of the cAMP analogues hyperpolarizing mitochondria (Fig. 5A–C). In contrast, 3
different inhibitors of GSK3-b caused depolarization (Fig. 6A–
C). These results also support the conclusion that VDAC
regulates mitochondrial DY in cancer cells.

Our initial experiments were conducted in HepG2 cells
incubated in HBSS, a simple glucose-supplemented electrolyte
solution. In complete growth medium, microtubule destabilization by nocodazole and microtubule stabilization with
paclitaxel also depolarized and hyperpolarized mitochondria.
However, in contrast to incubation in HBSS, the response to
nocodazole in growth medium was weaker and the response
to paclitaxel enhanced (Figs. 3B and 7A–C). Moreover, cAMP
did not depolarize mitochondria of HepG2 cells in complete
growth medium (data not shown), whereas PKA inhibition
with H89 induced similar hyperpolarization (Fig. 5D and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar changes occurred in A549
and UM-SCC-1 cancer cells in their respective growth media.
The decreased response to cAMP in culture medium suggests
that PKA may be in a higher activation state in culture
medium than in HBSS. Nonetheless, other factors may regulate mitochondrial sensitivity to free tubulin in cancer cells
incubated in complete medium. Overall, the results are consistent with the conclusion that mitochondrial suppression by
free tubulin is greater in growth medium than in HBSS.
In contrast to all cancer cell lines studied, free tubulin did
not inhibit mitochondrial DY formation in primary rat hepatocytes. Although nocodazole depolarized mitochondria,
paclitaxel did not hyperpolarize (Fig. 7A–C). Similarly, PKA
inhibition with H89 did not hyperpolarize mitochondria in
primary rat hepatocytes in marked contrast to the hyperpolarization that occurred in HepG2 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Thus, suppression of mitochondrial function by free
tubulin may be a unique characteristic of cancer cell metabolism. Lack of hyperpolarization after paclitaxel may be
related to higher tubulin polymerization in hepatocytes than
in cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The present findings suggest that gating of VDAC by
tubulin, PKA, and GSK-3b dynamically and globally regulates
mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells and that VDAC
has a "governator" function limiting mitochondrial metabolism in aerobic glycolysis (16). Similarly, VDAC gating to a
more closed state may promote selective acetaldehyde oxidation in the livers of ethanol-treated livers and slow mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis and free radical release during
hypoxia/reoxygenation and oxidative stress (16, 47–49). In

aerobic glycolysis (Warburg phenomenon), tumor cells prefer glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
Increased expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic
enzymes help explain the enhancement of glycolysis, but the
suppression of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells
remains poorly understood. The present findings suggest
that elevated levels of free tubulin in cancer cells augmented
by PKA agonism are promoting VDAC closure, thereby
limiting mitochondrial exchange of respiratory substrates,
ATP, ADP, and phosphate. Thus, VDAC closure may account,
at least in part, for suppression of mitochondrial metabolism
of the Warburg phenomenon. In contrast, in nontransformed rat hepatocytes, VDAC seems not to be rate-limiting
for mitochondrial metabolism. An implication of this conclusion is that inhibitors of tubulin- and PKA-mediated
VDAC closure might restore normal aerobic metabolism
in cancer cells and suppress cancer cell proliferation. Future
studies will be needed to determine how free tubulin affects
other aspects of mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism, what VDAC isoforms underlie these effects, whether
tubulin regulation occurs in vivo, and the feasibility of using
VDAC as a therapeutic target.
