Abstract
The treatment of breast cancer has beneﬁtted tremendously
from the generation of estrogen receptor-a (ERa)–targeted
therapies, but disease relapse continues to pose a challenge
due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. In an effort to
delineate potential predictive biomarkers of therapy responsiveness, multiple groups have identiﬁed several uncharacterized cofactors and interacting partners of ERa, including Split
Ends (SPEN), a transcriptional corepressor. Here, we demonstrate a role for SPEN in ERa-expressing breast cancers. SPEN
nonsense mutations were detectable in the ERa-expressing
breast cancer cell line T47D and corresponded to undetectable
protein levels. Further analysis of 101 primary breast tumors
revealed that 23% displayed loss of heterozygosity at the SPEN
locus and that 3% to 4% harbored somatically acquired mutations. A combination of in vitro and in vivo functional assays

with microarray-based pathway analyses showed that SPEN
functions as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation,
tumor growth, and survival. We also found that SPEN binds
ERa in a ligand-independent manner and negatively regulates
the transcription of ERa targets. Moreover, we demonstrate that
SPEN overexpression sensitizes hormone receptor–positive
breast cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of tamoxifen, but
has no effect on responsiveness to fulvestrant. Consistent with
these ﬁndings, two independent datasets revealed that high
SPEN protein and RNA expression in ERa-positive breast
tumors predicted favorable outcome in patients treated with
tamoxifen alone. Together, our data suggest that SPEN is
a novel tumor-suppressor gene that may be clinically useful
as a predictive biomarker of tamoxifen response in ERa-positive breast cancers. Cancer Res; 75(20); 4351–63. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

growth, proliferation, and survival (1). The ERa is a member of
the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulates gene transcription in the presence
of its ligand by binding cis-regulatory motifs, also known as
estrogen response elements, lying upstream of target genes or via
tethering to DNA by other transcription factors, including AP1
and SP1. DNA-bound ERa recruits the basal transcriptional
machinery and induces the expression of genes implicated in
numerous cancer signaling pathways, a process tightly regulated
by complex dynamic interactions with coactivators and corepressors (2, 3). Although the ERa has been shown to be one of the
most important mitogenic drivers in breast cancer in a multitude
of preclinical and clinical studies, genomic events affecting the
ESR1 gene are only observed in metastatic breast cancers (4, 5).
Interestingly, mutations and chromosomal aberrations appear to
occur at higher rates in coactivators (e.g., AIB1) and corepressors
(e.g., GATA3, NCOR1, and NCOR2) of the ERa, suggesting that
their regulation of the receptor's genomic actions may be intimately linked to the development of hormone-dependent
tumors.
With protumorigenic functions affecting proliferation,
growth, and survival, the ERa is the main oncogenic driver in
breast cancer and represents an important target for the treatment of hormone-responsive tumors. Therapies targeting the

Approximately 70% of breast cancers express the estrogen
receptor-a (ERa) and/or its transcriptional target, the progesterone receptor (PgR), and are dependent on hormones for their

ERa in breast cancer include antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen
and fulvestrant, and inhibitors of estrogen biosynthesis (aromatase inhibitors). Tamoxifen is a selective ER modulator that
competes with estrogen for the ligand-binding domain of the
ER and induces an alternative conformation that prevents
coactivator binding to the receptor but favors recruitment and
interaction with corepressors (6). Although tamoxifen has
been successfully used to treat both early and late hormone
receptor–positive breast cancers, more than 50% of patients
with advanced hormone-responsive tumors will progress or
experience disease relapse due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to tamoxifen (7). Although many mechanisms of resistance to tamoxifen have been characterized in vitro, none have
shown clinical utility as biomarkers guiding treatment with
tamoxifen in patients with ERa- and/or PgR-positive tumors.
Over the last decades, a number of previously uncharacterized
ERa partners and cofactors were identiﬁed, including Split Ends
(SPEN), a protein with essential regulatory roles in transcriptional repression (8–12). SPEN, which is also known as SMRT/
HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP), is a large nuclear
protein of 402 kDa characterized by four N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs and a highly conserved C-terminal SPOC (Spen
Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal) domain. In various model
organisms, SPEN has been shown to be critical during embryogenesis and throughout development, in part, due to its regulation of the Notch, TCF/LEF, and EGFR signaling pathways
(8, 9, 13). SPEN has also been identiﬁed as an estrogen-inducible
cofactor able to integrate nuclear hormone receptor activation
and repression (10). Despite some evidence for SPEN being
implicated in endocrine regulation and development, SPEN functions have not been investigated in breast cancer.
Using an innovative unbiased integrative genomic approach,
we identiﬁed mutations in the SPEN gene in a breast cancer cell
line and four primary breast tumors (14). We also found that
SPEN inhibits tumor growth and modulates the transcription
of ERa-target genes, including PGR and BCL2. Moreover, we
demonstrate that SPEN expression predicts response to tamoxifen in vitro and in clinical samples. Together, our ﬁndings show
that SPEN is a novel tumor-suppressor gene and a candidate
predictive biomarker of tamoxifen response in ERa-positive
breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MCF-7 and T47D cells were obtained from the ATCC and were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Wisent). BT20 and MDA-MB-436 were obtained from the
ATCC and cultured in EMEM and RPMI-1640 from ATCC supplemented with 10% FBS, respectively.
Cell viability assay
Cells were plated at a density of 2,500 cells per well in 96-well
plate for experiments performed in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plate for assays carried
under 1% FBS conditions. At 1, 2, 4, and 7 days, cell viability was
assessed by replacing the medium with a 10% Alamar Blue
solution (Invitrogen) prepared in DMEM. Cells were incubated
with the solution at 37 C for 4 hours and ﬂuorescence measured
with a plate reader, FLUOstar Optima, using 560 nm (Excitation)
and 590 nm (Emission) ﬁlter settings.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 6-well
plates in 1 mL of soft agar (0.3% soft agar in DMEM with 10%
FBS), plated onto 2 mL of solidiﬁed agar (0.7% soft agar in DMEM
with 10% FBS) and incubated at 37 C. Medium (250 mL) was
supplemented to each well twice weekly for 4 weeks. Colonies
were scored electronically using an automated cell colony counter
(GelCount; Oxford Optronix).
Plasmids
The full-length human SPEN cDNA cloned into the
pDream2.1/MCS expression vector was purchased from GenScript. SPEN-expressing vector and the empty control vector were
transfected in T47D cells using Attractene (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 hours, cells were seeded
in 6-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with
neomycin (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 250 or
500 mg/mL Clones were isolated and maintained in selection
media throughout culturing period.
SPEN knockdown by RNA interference
Two SPEN MISSIONshRNA plasmids with the following sequences: SPEN shRNA 1, 50 -CCGGCCTGTGGTAAAGGTGGTGTTTCTCGAGAAACACCACCTTTAC-CACAGGTTTTTG-30
(TRCN0000075165) and SPEN shRNA 2, 50 -CCGGCGGCTCCATCATCAATGACATCTCGAGAT-GTCATTGATGAT-GGAGCCGTTTTTG-30 (TRCN0000075166) were purchased from SigmaAldrich. pLKO.1-puro Non-Target Control and SPEN-speciﬁc
shRNA plasmids were transfected in MCF-7 cells using Attractene (Qiagen). After 72 hours, cells were seeded in 6-well plates
in DMEM plus 10% FBS supplemented with puromycin (Life
Technologies) at a concentration of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/m.
Clones were isolated and maintained in selection media
throughout the culturing period.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from subconﬂuent cultures using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences) and reversed transcribed into
cDNA with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR
were performed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems) and with the following probes: SPEN (Invitrogen,
Hs00209232_m1), PGR (Invitrogen, Hs01556702_m1), and18S
(Invitrogen, Hs99999901_s1).
DNA microarray expression proﬁling and analysis
Expression proﬁling was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions and following the One-Color MicroarrayBased Gene Expression Analysis Protocol from Agilent Technologies. Brieﬂy, integrity and concentration of the input RNA
was evaluated with the Agilent 2011 Bioanalyzer. One hundred
nanograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cRNA,
ampliﬁed and labeled with Cy3 dye. The resulting labeled cRNA
was puriﬁed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer and hybridized to a Sure Print G3 Human GE 860 K Microarray (Agilent
Technologies) for 17 hours at 65 C. The array was then washed
and scanned on the Agilent DNA Microarray scanner at a
resolution of 3 mmol/L. Images were extracted and normalized
with Feature Extraction software version 9.5. Expression

expression array were analyzed using Gene Spring GX (Agilent
Technologies).
Statistical analysis
Microarray expression data were processed with GeneSpring
GX software. Data were normalized to the 75th percentile of all
values on the microarrays and to the median expression levels of
all samples. The normalized gene expression data were ﬁltered on
ﬂags and only those classiﬁed as detected were allowed to pass the
ﬁlter and included in the analysis. The expression proﬁles of genes
differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold based on three
biologic replicates were compared using two-tailed unpaired
t tests.
Ingenuity pathway analysis
Microarray data were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis (IPA) software available at: http://www.ingenuity.
com. Genes up- or downregulated by at least 1.50-fold (P <
0.05) in Spen 1, SPEN sh1, and SPEN sh3 compared with their
respective controls were considered for further analyses. Functions (P < 0.05) predicted to be increased (z-score > 0.75) in
SPEN sh1 and SPEN sh3 relative to the nontarget shRNA
transfected MCF-7 clone (NT2) and anticipated to be decreased
(z-score < 0.75) in Spen 1 compared with its empty vector
transfected T47D clone (CTL1) were analyzed. Functions consistently modulated were considered as regulated by SPEN.
Similarly, an analysis of the upstream regulators predicted to
be responsible for the observed gene expression changes was
conducted. All molecule types were included in the analysis
except for chemicals and miRNAs. Upstream regulators (P <
0.05) predicted to be activated (z-score > 0.75) in SPEN sh1 and
SPEN sh3 relative to the nontarget shRNA-transfected MCF-7
clone (NT2) and anticipated to be inhibited (z-score < 0.75)
in Spen 1 compared with its empty vector T47D control (CTL1)
were analyzed. Those common to all pairs of cell lines were
considered as modulated by SPEN. The expression data of
tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were
also analyzed with IPA. For this analysis, a log2 ratio of 2 was
used to obtain a list of approximately 3,000 differentially
expressed genes between the tumor and normal-matched mammary sample. In each case, the predicted score of activation
(z-score) was computed for the ER and plotted against the log2
ratio of SPEN RNA expression in tumors compared with normal-matched breast tissue samples. A log2 ratio of 0.5 was
used to stratify patients into high and low SPEN-expressing
groups.
Fluorescence microscopy to quantify cells with chromatin
condensation and membrane permeabilization
Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5  105 cells per well in 6well plates and incubated at 37 C. Seventy-two hours after plating, 20 mL of Hoechst 33342 (HO, 100 mg/mL; Sigma) was added
to the culture medium and plates incubated at 37 C for 10
minutes. Cells were then stained with 2 mL of propidium iodide
(PI; 5 mg/mL; Sigma) and analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy
on an Axiovert 40 CFL (Zeiss) microscope. The percentage of
normal, apoptotic, and necrotic cells were estimated in six random ﬁelds per condition. Apoptotic cells showed highly pyknotic
nuclei stained with either HO or PI in the early and late phases of
apoptosis, respectively.

Survival assays
For experiments with tamoxifen, cells were seeded at a density
of 2,500 cells per well in 96-well plates in complete medium and
incubated at 37 C. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium
was replaced with 100 mL of hormone-depleted medium [DMEM
without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped FBS (Gibco)]. Another 24 hours later, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) or its vehicle was added to each well in
100 mL of hormone-depleted medium. Cell viability was measured 5 days later with a 10% Alamar Blue solution.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and lysed in
lysis buffer (250 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L Tris) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors
[5 mmol/L sodium ﬂuoride, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 10 mg/mL aprotinin,
and 10 mg/mL leupeptin]. After Micro-BCA quantiﬁcation
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), at least 250 mg of proteins were incubated
overnight with 1 mg of anti-SPEN antibody (Sigma; HPA015825)
or IgG control antibody (Abcam; ab46540-1). Protein A Dynabeads beads (Life Technologies) were added for 1.5 hours and
washed three times with 400 mL of lysis buffer. Precipitated beads
were then incubated at 95 C for 7 minutes in 60 mL of Laemmli
sample buffer followed by a centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1
minute. Proteins were ran in a precast 4% to 20% gel (Bio-Rad) for
4 hours at 120 V and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
overnight at 33 V. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBST
and immunoblotted overnight with an anti-SPEN antibody (Sigma; HPA015825, 1:500).
Western blotting
Subconﬂuent cells were collected by trypsinization, washed in
ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer freshly supplemented with
protease inhibitors. Lysates were then placed on a rocker machine
for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 C. Supernatants
were subjected to Bradford quantiﬁcation and 50 mg of proteins
were loaded and ran by SDS-PAGE in an 8% gel for 1 hour.
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with PgR (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) and a-tubulin (1:10,000; Abcam) antibodies at 4 C overnight. Protein bands
were detected using the Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent.
Clonogenic assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5  104 cells per cm2 and
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 hours.
Media was then replaced with 2 mL of hormone-depleted medium [DMEM without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
charcoal-stripped FBS (Gibco)]. Another 24 hours later, 5 or
10 mmol/L of tamoxifen or its vehicle was added to the cells in
hormone-depleted medium. Cells were stained with a ﬁxing
solution containing crystal violet 5 days after the addition of the
drug.
Stimulation with 17b-estradiol
Cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in
96-well plates in complete medium and incubated at 37 C.
Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with
200 mL of hormone-depleted medium [DMEM without phenol

(Gibco)]. Another 24 hours later, media was replaced with
1 nmol/L 17b-estradiol in hormone-depleted DMEM plus 10%
charcoal-stripped FBS for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured
at day 0, 2, 5, and 7 with a 10% Alamar Blue solution and fold
induction in proliferation by estradiol compared with 100%
control was determined by dividing ﬂuorescence values
obtained in the presence of estrogen over that obtained with
the vehicle.
Patient cohort
The tamoxifen 50/50 tissue microarray (TMA) cohort is a power
series, derived from the Calgary Tamoxifen Breast Cancer Cohort
(Cal-TBCC), which includes 50 patients alive 5 years after diagnosis and 50 patients who died of breast cancer within 5 years of
diagnosis. The Cal-TBCC is a retrospective database and contains
demographic data, clinical data, and pathologic data from a
parent cohort of 819 breast cancer patients diagnosed between
1985 and 2000 at the Tom Baker Cancer Center in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada. Inclusion criteria: conﬁrmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma and treatment with primary surgical intervention with or without postoperative local radiotherapy, followed by adjuvant tamoxifen endocrine therapy (20 mg orally/
day) for 5 years, regardless of ER or PgR status. HER2 status was
not systematically performed at the time of diagnosis for the
patients in this cohort. Exclusion criteria: if diagnostic biopsy or
primary surgical tissue specimens were unavailable, if patients
received prior or adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 534 cases met
the criteria with a median follow-up time of 82.1 months. The
clinical and initial pathology data were retrieved, data for progression-free survival at 5 years were retrieved, and formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded tissue blocks were acquired and replicate
0.6-mm cores were built into TMAs. All tissues were ﬁxed in
10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in parafﬁn according to standard procedures for the time period. Ethical approval
for the use of human tissue samples was obtained from the
Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board.
Breast tumors
One hundred consecutive breast tumors were collected as
part of a government-funded (FRSQ) tumor bank at the Centre
Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (Montreal, QC, Canada)
from 2000 to 2003. Patients had signed informed consent for
breast tumor banking. Tissues sections for each tumor showed
>70% tumor cells as determined by an H&E staining for each
sample. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNAmp extraction
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
aCGH of breast tumors
DNA quality was assessed using a 2100 bioanalyzer using a
DNA 12000 Lab ChIP Kit (Agilent Technologies). Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed as previously reported (15).
Loss-of-heterozygosity assessment using polymorphic
microsatellite repeat markers
Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis for the region surrounding 1p36.1 was performed using the AFM217zc3a polymorphic marker (Supplementary Table S4). PCR was performed in 12.5-mL volume containing 100 ng of genomic DNA,

4354 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

1mCi of 35S[dATP], 1 PCR buffer, 200 nm each of dCTP,
dGTP, and dTTP, 50 pmol of each primer, and 0.5 U of Taq
polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follow: 94 C for
5 minutes (1 cycle), 94 C for 30 seconds, 60 C for 30 seconds,
and 72 C for 30 seconds (29 cycles) followed by an incubation
at 72 C for 10 minutes (1 cycle). Products were electrophoresed
on denaturing gels and autoradiographed at room temperature
for 5 days. LOH was scored on the basis of the difference in the
relative intensity of signals representing two alleles in tumor
DNA samples. All samples positive for LOH or allelic imbalance at individual loci were analyzed twice in independent
assays and Sanger sequenced.
Mutation analysis of SPEN
Mutation analyses were performed as previously described
(14). Brieﬂy, the genomic sequence of the protein-encoding
region of SPEN was obtained from the UCSC Santa Cruz Genome
Bioinformatics Site available at: http://genome.ucsc.edu. Primer
pairs for PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing of SPEN were generated using the Primer3 software available at: http://bioinfo.ut.
ee/primer3-0.4.0/ (Supplementary Table S5). PCR products
derived from breast tumors were puriﬁed as per the manufacturer's recommendations using the QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit
(Qiagen Sciences) and sequenced at the McGill University (Montreal, QC, Canada) and Genome Quebec Innovation Center and
the TGEN DNA sequencing facility. Sequence chromatograms
were aligned and analyzed with the Staden Package (http://
staden.sourceforge.net/) and the Mutation surveyor software version 3.24 by using the full-length SPEN reference sequence
NM_015001.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
For cell-cycle analyses, cells were detached with trypsin,
washed in PBS supplemented with 5 mmol/L EDTA, suspended
in a ﬁxing solution (1 mL of PBS, 5 mmol/L EDTA for 3 mL of
100% ethanol), and incubated at 20 C for at least 24 hours.
Then, cells were washed with PBS/EDTA and resuspended in 2
mL of staining solution (PBS, 50 mg/mL PI, and 20 mg/mL
RNAse A). For Annexin V/PI staining experiments, cells were
detached with trypsin and washed once with PBS. Then, they
were resuspended in 200 mL of Annexin V binding solution
(1) and stained with 4 mL of PI and 4 mL of Annexin V. For
both assays, cell ﬂuorescence signals were determined immediately after staining using a FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The analysis was performed using the BD
CellQuest (Becton Dickinson), ModFit (Becton Dickinson),
and FlowJo software.
Intersection probabilities
To determine the statistical signiﬁcance of intersection between
two lists of genes, we assessed the probability of this intersection
to occur by performing 10,000 independent simulations with
randomly selected lists of genes of the same size. P values were
calculated using a hypergeometric test.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were plated (1.2  106 cells in 150-mm culture dishes)
and grown for 72 hours in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were
ﬁxed at room temperature for 30 minutes in 2 mmol/L Ethylene
glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (16) followed with 10 minutes

in 1% formaldehyde. Glycine was added (125 mmol/L ﬁnal
concentration) and left at room temperature for 5 minutes to
quench formaldehyde. Cells were rinsed twice and scraped in icecold PBS. Collected cells were then centrifuged at 1,400 rpm for 5
minutes and lysed into lysis buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES-KOH pH
7.5, 140 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) freshly supplemented with
protease inhibitors. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 minutes
and sonicated to obtain fragments of 300 to 1,000 bp in size
(setting: 25%, 10 times 15 seconds). After centrifugation (15
minutes 13 000 rpm, 4 C), the sheared chromatin was diluted
in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA pH 8, 20
mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 8, 150 mmol/L) freshly supplemented with
protease inhibitors. Samples were then incubated with 1.5 mg of
antibody (SPEN: HPA015825, Sigma ERa: sc-543, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, IgG: ab46540-1, Abcam) at 4 C with rotation
overnight in a ﬁnal volume of 1 mL. DNA–protein interactions
were washed three times for 10 minutes with wash buffer (0.1%,
1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA pH 8, 20 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH
8, 150 mmol/L NaCl) and once for 10 minutes with ﬁnal wash
buffer (0.1%, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA pH 8, 20 mmol/L
Tris–HCl pH 8, 500 mmol/L NaCl). Chromatin was eluted with
350 mL of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mmol/L NaHCO3) by
rotation for 15 minutes and reverse cross-linked with 4 mL of
proteinase K solution at 55 C for 90 minutes followed by an
overnight incubation at 65 C. DNA was puriﬁed using the
DNeasy Mini Spin columns (Qiagen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR ampliﬁcation of a DNA fragment, 311
kb upstream of the PGR transcription start site was performed
using the following primers: forward 50 -CCA CTT TGC CAC ATG
ACA TC REV-30 REV 50 -AAC TCC CAA GGG ACC ATT TC-30 .

Results
SPEN is mutated and underexpressed in breast tumors
Using an integrative genomic approach, we previously identiﬁed a number of genes containing nonsense mutations and
mapping to regions exhibiting LOH in breast cancer cell lines
(14, 17). Brieﬂy, this approach involved the proﬁling of cell lines
treated with emetine, an inhibitor of the nonsense-mediated RNA
decay (NMD) pathway (17). Genes whose transcript levels were
increased by emetine treatment potentially contained a nonsense
mutation and were prioritized on the basis of those that aligned to
regions of LOH or deletion as assayed by genotyping with singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays. Using this strategy, we
identiﬁed and further established the AT-rich interactive domain
1a (ARID1A) as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in breast
cancer, a ﬁnding that has since been conﬁrmed by the discovery
of ARID1A mutations in breast tumors by several groups (16, 18).
Similarly, we identiﬁed an insertion/truncation mutation at
nucleotide 1184 in the SPEN gene and LOH at the SPEN locus
(chromosome 1p36), resulting in undetectable SPEN protein
levels in the ERa-positive, T47D breast cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C).
To assess the prevalence of somatically acquired genomic
aberrations and mutations affecting SPEN in breast cancer, we
performed aCGH or microsatellite PCR at the AFM217zc3a polymorphic marker on a cohort of 101 primary breast tumors (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Table S1). We found that 22.8% (23 of 101)
of tumors had LOH or a copy number loss at the SPEN locus.
Sequencing of the protein-encoding exons and splice-site junc-

tions of SPEN revealed that 17.4% (4 of 23) of tumors with LOH
harbored a somatic mutation within the gene. Two missense
mutations (P2158A, A3327T) were detected in two different
samples, whereas the same nonsense mutation (Q3141X) was
found in two other tumors (Fig. 1B and C).
To corroborate the prevalence of genomic and genetic alterations affecting SPEN, we then surveyed data from the TCGA and
the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC). We
found that SPEN RNA expression is downregulated in invasive
breast carcinoma compared with normal breast tissue (P ¼
1.43E07) and that SPEN is homo- or heterozygously deleted
in 27.2% of breast cancer samples (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B; refs. 19–22), similar to the prevalence of LOH in our
own tumor set. Data analysis also revealed that tumors harboring nonsense mutations in SPEN express low to very low
SPEN mRNA levels, even in the absence of copy number loss
and that breast cancer samples with LOH at the 1p36 locus
express signiﬁcantly lower SPEN transcript levels compared
with tumors without copy number alterations (Supplementary
Fig. S2B; refs. 20, 22). In both databases, somatic mutations in
SPEN were reported in 2% to 3% of breast cancers as well as in
many other cancer types, with a prevalence reaching 14.3% and
11% in cervical and endometrial cancers, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2C; ref. 23).
SPEN acts as a tumor-suppressor gene in ER-positive breast
cancer cells
Given the suggested role of SPEN in endocrine regulation
and our identiﬁcation of an insertion–truncation mutation in
SPEN in the ERa-positive T47D breast cancer cell line, we
attempted to investigate the functions of SPEN in the context
of ERa-positive breast cancers. We ﬁrst transfected a SPENexpressing vector in T47D cells and isolated two stable clones
(T47D-Spen 1–2; Fig. 2A and B), with varying degrees of
restored SPEN expression. T47D-SPEN cells displayed a marked
reduction of proliferation in both normal and low serum
conditions (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3A) and exhibited
increased sensitivity to apoptosis under serum-starved growth
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Reintroduction of SPEN
into T47D cells did not lead to their accumulation in G1 or G2
either in 10% or 1% FBS conditions, suggesting that the
observed effects are not due to cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary
Fig. S3C and S3D). A soft agar assay revealed that restoration of
SPEN levels in T47D cells abrogates anchorage-independent
growth (Fig. 2D). To further establish SPEN as a tumor-suppressor gene in breast cancer, in vivo xenografts studies were
performed with BALB-c nude mice implanted with 60 days slow
release 17b-estradiol pellets and injected with T47D control
cells in one mammary fat pad and T47D-SPEN cells injected
contralaterally. Of a total of 8 mice that developed palpable
tumors, 7 developed tumors from control cells without tumors
arising from contralateral SPEN-overexpressing clones (Fig. 2E
and Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). Notably, only one tumor
derived from T47D-SPEN cells was collected after completion
of the study and its volume was much smaller than control
tumors. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results support the
tumor-suppressive functions of SPEN in breast cancer.
Then, to further characterize SPEN functions in ERa-positive
breast cancer cells, we silenced its expression in another hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, which express
high endogenous levels of the protein (Supplementary Fig. S1B

between MCF-7-shRNA-SPEN clones and their control (data
not shown). The results of the functional assays performed with
MCF-7 cells are complementary to those obtained with T47D
cells and demonstrate that SPEN regulates proliferation, tumor
growth, and survival in ERa-positive breast cancer cells. Interestingly, using a cohort of 1,784 breast cancer patients with
luminal A tumors, we assessed the clinical signiﬁcance of SPEN
expression and found that high SPEN RNA levels were signiﬁcantly associated with good survival (HR, 0.78; P ¼ 0.005)
over 20 years (Fig. 3D; ref. 24).

Then, to evaluate whether the tumor-suppressive function of
SPEN extends to ER-negative breast cancer cells, we silenced its
expression using siRNAs in BT20 and MDA-MB-436, two triplenegative breast cancer cell lines expressing high RNA and protein
levels of SPEN (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), and measured
SPEN effects on proliferation. Contrary to our expectations, we
found that SPEN knockdown limited the proliferation of both cell
lines in proliferation assays, suggesting that SPEN may have
proproliferative functions in ERa-negative breast cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4F). Consistent with these ﬁndings
is the observation that SPEN RNA expression levels are predictive
of poor prognosis (HR, 1.49; P ¼ 0.016) in a cohort of 581
patients with basal breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4G;
ref. 24). Although further experiments are required to deﬁne the
roles of SPEN in basal breast cancers, our results suggest that SPEN
has opposing functions in ERa-positive and ERa-negative cancer
cells while its expression may serve as a useful marker for patient
prognostication and stratiﬁcation in both subtypes.

SPEN regulates the expression of genes related to cell death
To delineate the transcriptional program regulated by SPEN
in ERa-positive breast cancers, gene expression proﬁling using
DNA microarrays was conducted on RNA from one of the two
clones generated with the SPEN expression vector (Spen 1, the
highest expressor), as well as one of the two clones generated
with each of the shRNA hairpin vectors, SPEN shRNA1 (SPEN
sh1) and SPEN shRNA2 (SPEN sh3), along with their respective controls. Microarray results conﬁrmed the knockdown or
overexpression of SPEN in each stably transfected clone (Supplementary Table S2). IPA performed with genes signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) altered (1.5-fold) in each clone compared with
its control revealed that the largest proportion of genes
(32%–37%) in our dataset are associated with "cell death and
survival" (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Using the DeathBase
database, we found that 31% of genes reported to be involved
in cell death (27 of 86) are differentially expressed in SPEN
clones compared with their controls (Supplementary Fig. S5B–

S5D; ref. 25). Notably, most of these differentially expressed
genes implicated in cell death and survival (e.g., BCL2, BMF,
and BIK) are localized at the mitochondrial membrane and
participate in apoptosis induced by intracellular signals. We
also found that the expression of BCL2, an estrogen-target gene
that has strong antiapoptotic functions, is signiﬁcantly downregulated in both SPEN-overexpressing T47D clones (Supplementary Fig. S5F), a ﬁnding that may explain, at least in part,
the increased susceptibility of T47D-Spen 1 and T47D-Spen 2
to apoptosis. Then, to better deﬁne the tumor-suppressive
activity of SPEN in breast cancer, we focused on functions
predicted to be increased in MCF-7-SPEN-sh1 and MCF-7SPEN-sh3 silenced cells and decreased in T47D-Spen 1. With
these criteria, only the biologic function of "cell survival" was
identiﬁed as consistently repressed by SPEN expression (Supplementary Fig. S5E). The data obtained from transcriptome
analyses thus point to a role for SPEN in the regulation of cell
viability and these results are consistent with our ﬁndings of
cells grown under low serum and anchorage-independent
conditions.
Transcriptional regulation of the ERa targets by SPEN
Further analyses with IPA revealed that most upstream regulators affected by the modulation of SPEN expression are
involved in the regulation of transcription (Supplementary Fig.
S6A), providing additional evidence that SPEN participates in

4358 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

the organization of transcriptional programs. In addition, we
found that the ER is the only upstream regulator whose predicted activation is inversely correlated with SPEN expression
(Fig. 4A). To strengthen this relationship between SPEN and the
ER, we then cross-referenced our microarray data with two
publicly available lists of 7,095 and 5,342 genes bound by
ERa and ERb, respectively, within 25 kb of their transcription
start site as assayed by ChIP-seq experiments in MCF-7 cells
treated with 17b-estradiol (26, 27). In both cases, almost half
the number of genes signiﬁcantly upregulated in MCF-7shRNA-SPEN cells compared with their control were included
in these lists (P ¼ 0.00003; Supplementary Fig. S6B–S6E;
ref. 28). Interestingly, no such enrichment was observed with
the lists of downregulated genes in MCF-7-shRNA-SPEN cells.
Then, because ERa and ERb often dimerize with one another,
we next examined whether the observed enrichments were
speciﬁc for genes bound by both receptors and/or uniquely
bound by ERa or ERb. Interestingly, we found a signiﬁcant
overlap between our microarray data and genes bound by both
receptors or reported to be uniquely bound by ERa upon
stimulation with estrogen. No signiﬁcant overlap with genes
solely bound by ERb was observed, suggesting that our data are
mainly enriched for ERa but not ERb target genes. In line
with these results, we also observed that restoration of SPEN
levels signiﬁcantly dampens estradiol-induced proliferation
in T47D cells (Fig. 4B; P ¼ 0.002). Next, to evaluate whether

SPEN under hormone-depleted conditions, a ﬁnding that is
consistent with corepressors interacting more strongly with unbound nuclear receptors. Interestingly, no interaction between
SPEN and ERb was detected under these conditions, suggesting
that SPEN preferentially interacts with ERa over ERb, consistent
with our aforementioned transcriptomic analysis. Then, to
further support a role for SPEN in the repression of ERa-dependent transcription, the expression of the PgR, a primary ERa
target gene, was measured in our SPEN transfectants (29). We
observed an inverse relationship between SPEN and PgR
expression, at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4D–G and
Supplementary Table S2). In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed with MCF-7 and T47D cells
revealed that SPEN modestly but consistently interacts with
DNA upstream of the PgR gene at a site also bound by the ERa
in MCF-7 cells but not in T47D cells (Fig. 4H and Supplementary Fig. S6G). Interestingly, SPEN interaction with DNA
at this genomic site was restored by its reexpression in T47D
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6H). Together, these results provide
evidence for SPEN as a negative regulator of the in ERa-dependent transcriptional program in ERa-positive breast cancer
cells.

The clinical signiﬁcance of SPEN expression levels on tamoxifen response was determined by assessing its nuclear staining
in TMAs containing triplicate core biopsies from 100 early-stage
breast cancer patients treated exclusively with adjuvant tamoxifen. This cohort was composed of 50 patients who had disease
recurrence and died from breast cancer and 50 patients without
recurrence or death from the disease. Tissues were scored
according to SPEN nuclear staining intensity and percentage
of SPEN-positive tumor cells. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses
of the 65 hormone-responsive (ERaþPgRþHER2) breast
tumors revealed that high SPEN protein expression was significantly predictive of favorable clinical outcome (P ¼ 0.029;
Fig. 5E). Moreover, high SPEN RNA expression was strongly
correlated with good relapse-free survival (HR, 0.55; P ¼
0.0055) in an independent cohort of 424 luminal A ER-positive
patients treated with tamoxifen alone (Fig. 5F; refs. 24, 30).
This prognostic effect was not observed in patients with ERanegative tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7I), suggesting that
SPEN expression levels may serve as a predictive biomarker of
tamoxifen response in hormone-sensitive breast cancers.

SPEN genomic content and expression levels predict ER
activation
To begin to evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings
that suggest a tumor-suppressive role for SPEN in ERa-positive
breast cancers due to its regulation of ERa-dependent transcription, the expression proﬁles of 60 luminal A breast tumors
and their normal-matched counterpart were extracted from the
TCGA database and subjected to pathway analysis using IPA.
A pairwise comparison of SPEN RNA expression in this subset
of 60 tumors showed that low SPEN expression predicts higher
ER activation (Fig. 4I). As anticipated, no such correlation was
observed in a subset of 40 basal breast tumors (data not
shown). Taken together, our data suggest that SPEN represses
ER-driven transcription in ERa positive but not hormone
receptor–negative breast tumors and that ERa activity is strongly enhanced in breast cancer cells expressing low SPEN mRNA
levels.

One of the hallmarks of cancer is the accumulation of
genetic mutations in tumor cell DNA, resulting in the activation of oncogenes and the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
(31). Although their expression is usually lost in many tumors
compared with normal tissues due to genetic and epigenetic
events, the limited expression of tumor-suppressor genes may
nevertheless be of clinical relevance. Our identiﬁcation of
SPEN as a tumor-suppressor gene and candidate predictive
marker of tamoxifen response, due to its repressive activity of
ERa-dependent transcription in breast cancer, demonstrates
that the study of tumor-suppressor genes might uncover novel
mechanisms of drug resistance and biomarkers of drug
response.
Using a genomic approach, we discovered LOH at the SPEN
locus in 23% of breast cancers. Sequencing of SPEN in tumors
with LOH at the 1p36 locus identiﬁed four nonsynonymous
mutations, including a nonsense mutation recurrent in two
independent tumors, adding to the 29 mutations in breast
tumors reported in the COSMIC database (23). This ﬁnding,
in addition to our observation that samples from TCGA with
nonsense mutations in SPEN express low SPEN mRNA levels,
suggest that SPEN gene expression might be regulated by the
NMD pathway in breast cancer cells, a mechanism that we have
shown to be responsible for undetectable SPEN protein levels
in T47D cells.
To establish SPEN as a tumor-suppressor gene and deﬁne its
functions in breast cancer, we used an in vitro model with MCF-7
and T47D cells, two ERa-positive breast cancer cell lines expressing high and very low SPEN protein levels, respectively. The
forced expression of SPEN in T47D cells and its knockdown in
MCF-7 cells unmasked an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation,
growth, and survival. In addition, gene expression analyses of
MCF-7 and T47D clones identiﬁed "cell survival" as the major
biologic function affected by the modulation of SPEN expression. The enrichment of our SPEN-regulated gene expression
proﬁles for pro- and antiapoptotic genes provides a molecular
mechanism for the altered response of SPEN-silenced MCF-7
and SPEN-overexpressing T47D cells to apoptotic stimuli, such

SPEN sensitizes ERa-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen
Having shown that SPEN represses the transcription of genes
downstream of the ERa, we hypothesized that SPEN may affect
cellular responses to the antiestrogen, tamoxifen. Using pharmacologically relevant tamoxifen concentrations, we found
that SPEN silencing confers resistance to the drug in cell
viability and clonogenic assays while its overexpression substantially increases sensitivity to tamoxifen (Fig. 5A and B;
Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6E). Interestingly, induction of apoptosis following tamoxifen treatment
was considerably reduced in MCF-7-shRNA clones and 2- to
3-fold higher in T47D-SPEN cells than in their respective
controls (Fig. 5C and D; Supplementary Fig. S6F–S6H), indicating that SPEN sensitizes cells to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Notably, modulation of SPEN expression did not affect
cells sensitivity to ICI 182780 (fulvestrant; Supplementary
Fig. S8A–S8D), a pure ERa antagonist that induces ERa degradation, suggesting that SPEN's interaction with an intact
ERa may be critical to predispose cells to apoptosis in response
to tamoxifen treatment.

conditions.
Further analysis of our microarray data revealed that SPEN
regulates the expression of a number of genes downstream of
the ER, conﬁrming its role as a repressor of the ERa-dependent
signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. These results extend
those of Shi and colleagues (10), who demonstrated that SPEN
inhibits estradiol-induced ERa-dependent transcription in a
luciferase assay. Although not derived from experiments conducted with breast cancer cells, their results were highly suggestive of SPEN having repressive effects on ERa transcription.
In a yeast-two hybrid assay, they also showed that SPEN

molecule with coactivating functions, and SMRT and NCoR,

two ERa corepressors. Our observation that SPEN represses the
expression of ERa target genes, including the transcription of
the PGR, and that it coimmunoprecipitates with the ERa
complex in the presence of estradiol, demonstrates that endogenous SPEN can bind and repress ligand-bound ERa. Although
most corepressors bind unliganded receptors, we have demonstrated that SPEN acts on both estradiol-bound and unbound
receptors, a property unique to few ERa coregulators. This
function may be particularly important in limiting the genomic
effects of 17b-estradiol and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival between successive hormonal cycles in
the normal breast. Indeed, our ﬁnding that SPEN knockdown
potentiates the proliferation of the normal-like epithelial cell
line, MCF10A, exposes a possible a role for SPEN in preventing

cellular transformation. Genetic aberrations affecting SPEN in
normal and premalignant breast epithelial cells could therefore
potentiate ERa transcriptional activity, especially during the
follicular and estrogen-driven phase of the menstrual cycle, and
lead to the expression of estrogen-responsive genes, including
the PgR as well as antiapoptosis-related genes, all of which may
contribute to cell survival and cancer development.
Given our results showing that SPEN expression establishes a
proclivity to apoptosis in ERa-positive breast cancer cells, and
that it represses the transcriptional activity of the ERa, we
evaluated the sensitivity of SPEN-silenced MCF-7 and SPENoverexpressing T47D cells to the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, a
drug that antagonizes the ERa. Whereas several mechanisms
of resistance to tamoxifen are known, such as ERa phosphorylation at S167, HER2 overexpression, and hyperactivation of
the PI3K pathway, no predictive biomarker for tamoxifen
response is in current clinical use other than the ERa and the
PgR (21, 32–35). Using an in vitro breast cancer model with
MCF-7 and T47D cells, we showed that SPEN affects tamoxifen
but not fulvestrant sensitivity in ERa-positive breast cancer
cells. SPEN protein and RNA expression in two patient cohorts
that had received tamoxifen therapy alone in the adjuvant
setting support our ﬁndings, with signiﬁcantly better outcomes
for patients with breast tumors showing high SPEN expression
than for those with low/moderate SPEN expression. Although
further clinical validation is needed, our ﬁndings suggest that a
subpopulation of ERa-positive early-stage breast cancer
patients may not beneﬁt from adjuvant tamoxifen. In addition,
our observation that SPEN expression does not affect cells
sensitivity to ICI182780, a drug that induces ERa degradation,
suggests that SPEN interaction with the ERa may be critical to
establish a proclivity for cell death in response to tamoxifen
treatment. It will thus be important in future studies to also
evaluate the effect of SPEN expression on sensitivity to other
endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors, which do
not alter intracellular ERa levels. In addition to having potential clinical applications, such studies may provide new insights
into SPEN functions in the context of antiestrogen drug
response. Taken together, our data indicate that breast cancers
expressing SPEN may be more sensitive to tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis and that SPEN expression could serve as a marker of
tamoxifen response in ERa-positive breast cancers.
It is noteworthy that modulation of SPEN expression consistently affected serum deprivation and tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis in both T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines,
given that they have different defects in apoptotic mechanisms:
T47D cells contain a p53 mutation and MCF-7 cells do not
express the apoptotic mediator caspase-3 (36, 37). With genomic and nongenomic actions affecting proliferation, migration,
and apoptosis, the ERa has a central role in the biology of
breast cancer. Indeed, prior studies have demonstrated that the
ERa can protect breast cancer cells from program-induced cell
death, in part, by modulating the expression of apoptosisrelated genes, such as BCL2, BIK, and BMF (16, 38, 39). Whereas very few of the well-established ERa-target genes (i.e.,
GREB1, TFF1, CCND1, etc.) were differentially expressed in
our microarray data besides PGR, the modulation of SPEN
expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells affected the expression
of a number of apoptosis-related genes, including BCL2, BIK,
and BMF. Our ﬁnding that approximately 35% of genes
involved in "cell death and survival" and regulated by SPEN

4362 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

in each of our SPEN clones are also downstream of the ER (P <
0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S6F) suggests that the antiapoptotic transcriptional program regulated by the ERa is likely
controlled by SPEN (28).
Generally, our ﬁndings suggest that the inactivation of SPEN
by deletion and/or intragenic mutation may contribute to
breast tumor formation and progression. As SPEN mutations
were reported in other cancer types, we can speculate that SPEN
tumor-suppressive functions extend to many other tissues.
Future studies should therefore seek to evaluate the functions
of SPEN in other cancers, such as cervical and endometrial
cancer, in which the occurrence of SPEN mutations is very high
(14% and 11%, respectively). In conclusion, our results establish SPEN as a regulator of ERa-dependent transcription
of apoptosis-related genes in breast cancer and provide functional and clinical evidence for SPEN as a tumor-suppressor
gene and a candidate predictive biomarker of tamoxifen
response in ERa-positive breast cancers.
