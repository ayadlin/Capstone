Abstract
Poor penetration of antitumor drugs into the extravascular tumor tissue is often a major factor limiting the
efﬁcacy of cancer treatments. Our group has recently described a strategy to enhance tumor penetration of
chemotherapeutic drugs through use of iRGD peptide (CRGDK/RGPDC). This peptide comprises two sequence
motifs: RGD, which binds to avb3/5 integrins on tumor endothelia and tumor cells, and a cryptic CendR motif
(R/KXXR/K-OH). Once integrin binding has brought iRGD to the tumor, the peptide is proteolytically cleaved
to expose the cryptic CendR motif. The truncated peptide loses afﬁnity for its primary receptor and binds to
neuropilin-1, activating a tissue penetration pathway that delivers the peptide along with attached or coadministered payload into the tumor mass. Here, we describe the design of a new tumor-penetrating peptide
based on the current knowledge of homing sequences and internalizing receptors. The tumor-homing motif in
the new peptide is the NGR sequence, which binds to endothelial CD13. The NGR sequence was placed in the
context of a CendR motif (RNGR), and this sequence was embedded in the iRGD framework. The resulting
peptide (CRNGRGPDC, iNGR) homed to tumor vessels and penetrated into tumor tissue more effectively than
the standard NGR peptide. iNGR induced greater tumor penetration of coupled nanoparticles and co-administered compounds than NGR. Doxorubicin given together with iNGR was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than the
drug alone. These results show that a tumor-speciﬁc, tissue-penetrating peptide can be constructed from known
sequence elements. This principle may be useful in designing tissue-penetrating peptides for other diseases.

Introduction
The vasculature of each tissue is unique in terms of
protein expression and these molecular differences are
referred to as "vascular zip codes" (1). The selectively
expressed proteins provide targets for speciﬁc delivery of
diagnostic and therapeutic compounds to the vasculature of
desired tissues. Currently, a variety of tumor-targeting peptides are in preclinical and clinical development. However,
vascular abnormalities, ﬁbrosis, and contraction of extracellular matrix contribute to an increased interstitial ﬂuid
pressure inside the tumor, which impedes drug delivery into
the extravascular tumor tissue (2).
Our group has recently reported the identiﬁcation of the
CendR motif (R/KXXR/K) that is capable of increasing the

penetration of peptides, chemicals, and synthetic and biologic
nanoparticles into tissues through the engagement of neuropilin-1 (NRP-1; ref. 3). Speciﬁc penetration into tumors was
achieved through the use of an iRGD peptide (CRGDK/RGPDC;
ref. 4). iRGD, identiﬁed by in vivo phage display for tumorhoming peptides, combines targeting to tumor vessels and
tumor parenchyma through an RGD motif with the cell-internalizing and tissue-penetrating properties of a CendR motif
RGDK/R in the peptide (4). iRGD mechanism of action involves
3 steps. First, the RGD sequence binds to avb3/5 integrins.
Then, a proteolytic cleavage by a yet-to-be-identiﬁed host protease(s) exposes the CendR motif, which is now able to interact with NRP-1 to trigger the internalization process. This
strategy allows the activation of the CendR motif only in a targeted tissue, avoiding NRP-1 activation in normal vasculature.
Interestingly, iRGD triggers a speciﬁc tumor penetration of not
only iRGD-coupled compounds but also drugs co-administered
with free iRGD peptide (5). The CendR motif also activates the
penetration pathway through binding to NRP-2 (6).
Potentially, the addition of a cryptic CendR motif could
increase the penetration of other tumor targeting peptides,
providing more tools to overcome the poor delivery of drugs
to tumors. We set out to test this hypothesis using the NGR
tumor-homing motif. The NGR sequence was identiﬁed by
in vivo phage display in tumor-bearing mice (7). Initially, it
was thought to bind one or more of the integrins selectively
expressed in angiogenic vessels (7, 8). This idea was further
supported by the discovery that the asparagine in the NGR

motif undergoes a spontaneous deamidation reaction that
yields iso-aspartic acid (isoDGR), generating an RGD mimetic
(9, 10). However, the unaltered NGR motif also speciﬁcally
homes to tumor vessels, where it binds to an isoform of
aminopeptidase N (CD13; refs. 11, 12). NGR peptides have
been used to target a variety of agents into tumors; an NGR
conjugate of human TNF-a is in advanced clinical trials for
cancer therapy (13–16). Here, we combined the NGR motif with
a CendR motif to create a new tumor-homing peptide with
tissue-penetrating properties.

Materials and Methods
Animal use
All procedures on the animals, including those to ensure
minimizing discomfort, have been carried out according to the
protocol approved at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research
Institute (La Jolla, CA).
Preparation of compounds
Synthetic peptides (4), peptide-coated nanoworms (NW;
ref. 17), and peptide-expressing T7 phage (18) were prepared
as described elsewhere. Doxorubicin was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Evans Blue was purchased from MP Biomedicals.
Cell lines and tumor models
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Lonza)
were cultured in complete EGM-2 medium from Lonza. 4T1
cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Thermo Scientiﬁc) supplemented with 10% FBS and
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). All tumor cell lines were
bought and authenticated by American Type Culture Collection. Orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors were generated by injecting
105 cells into the mammary fat pad of female BALB/c mice at
the age of 4 to 6 weeks (Harlan Sprague-Dawley).
In vitro phage-binding and internalization assays
Phage ampliﬁcation, puriﬁcation, titration, sequencing, and
UV inactivation were conducted as reviewed (18). One million
cells were incubated with 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of
puriﬁed phage in DMEM/1% BSA at 4 C for binding or 37 C for
internalization. The cells were washed with cold DMEM/BSA 4
times, lysed in lysogeny broth (LB) containing 1% Nonidet P-40
(LB-NP40), and titrated. In internalization assays, the second
wash was replaced with an acid wash (500 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1
mol/L glycine, 1% BSA, pH 2.5) to remove and inactivate phage
bound to the cell surface. In inhibition assays, the cells were
incubated with 1 mg/mL of neutralizing anti-NRP-1 antibody
(R&D Systems), control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 10fold excess of UV-inactivated phage 15 minutes before adding
the phage of interest.
Ex vivo tumor-dipping assays
The assays were conducted as described elsewhere (5, 6).
Brieﬂy, 4T1 tumor–bearing mice were anesthetized and perfused through the heart with PBS containing 1% BSA. The
tumors were excised and incubated with 109 pfu of phage
in DMEM/1% BSA for 1 hour at 37 C. After extensive washes

www.aacrjournals.org

with PBS, the tumors were lysed in 1 mL of LB/NP-40 for
phage titration. In some cases, the tumors were ﬁxed in PBS
containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and processed for
immunostaining.
Biodistribution of peptides, phage, and nanoworms
In vivo tumor-homing experiments with peptides, phage,
and nanoworms were conducted as described (4, 17). Brieﬂy,
109 pfu of phage particles were injected into the tail vein of
tumor-bearing mice and allowed to circulate for 40 minutes.
The mice were perfused through the heart with PBS containing
1% BSA under deep anesthesia. The tumors and tissues were
excised and mechanically homogenized for phage titration
or ﬁxed in 4% PFA for immunostaining. In some cases, 50 mg
of anti-NRP-1 antibody or control IgG was intravenously
injected 15 minutes before the phage injection. For the peptide-homing studies, 100 mL of 1 mmol/L FAM-labeled peptides
were intravenously injected into tumor mice and allowed to
circulate for 1 hour. In case of the nanoworms, particles at
a dose of 5 mg/kg of iron were injected into the tail vein of
tumor mice and allowed to circulate for 5 hours. After perfusion of the mice, tissues were collected, macroscopically
observed under UV light (Illuminatool Bright Light System
LT-9900), and processed for immunostaining. Intratumoral
accumulation of nanoworms was quantiﬁed with ImageJ.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescence on cells was conducted using
10 mmol/L FAM peptides and following the protocol previously described (19). Immunoﬂuorescence on frozen sections was conducted as described earlier (4) using the
following antibodies at 1:200 dilution: rat anti-mouse CD31
Alexa-594 (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-T7 phage (3), and donkey
anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). Images were taken using a
Fluoview confocal microscope (Olympus).
In vivo systemic permeability assay
Tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously with
4 mmol/kg of peptide combined with 1 mg of Evans Blue,
10 mg/kg of free doxorubicin, or 5 mg iron/kg of CGKRK-coated
nanoworms (20). After indicated time of circulation, the mice
were perfused through the heart with PBS supplemented with
1% BSA, and tissues were collected. Evans Blue was extracted
by incubating the tissues in 1 mL of 2,2 N-methylformamide
overnight at 37 C with mild shaking. After centrifugation, the
optical density (OD)600 of the supernatant was measured. To
assess the extravasation of CGKRK-NWs, tissues were ﬁxed in
4% PFA overnight at 4 C and subjected to immunostaining
for CD31-positive blood vessels. For doxorubicin quantiﬁcation
(21), excised tissues were mechanically homogenized in 1 mL of
1% SDS containing 1 mmol/L H2SO4 and frozen overnight in
2 mL of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (1:1, v/v). The samples
were melted, vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000  g for 15
minutes, and OD490 of the organic (lower) phase was measured.
Tumor treatment studies
Mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors at 50 mm3
received intravenous injections of free doxorubicin (3 mg/kg)

that is expected to result from proteolytic activation of iNGR
(CRNGR), which we refer to as iNGRt. The conventional NGR
(CNGRC), RGD (CRGDC), iRGD (CRGDKGDPC), and activated
iRGD (CRGDK) peptides were used as controls. The peptides
used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Tumor treatment studies were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA for repeated
measurements.

iNGR and NGR bind to the same primary receptor
HUVECs) express on their surface both the NGR receptor
CD13 and the CendR receptor NRP-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
iNGR bound to HUVECs as efﬁciently as CNGRC, whether
tested as FAM-labeled peptide (Fig. 1A) or displayed on phage
(Fig. 1B, black columns). As expected, the iNGR phage did not
bind CD13þ U937 monocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C),
as previously reported for the CNGRC peptide (11). UVinactivated phage displaying CNGRC inhibited the HUVEC
binding of the iNGR phage in a dose-dependent fashion,
whereas inactivated CRGDC did not differ from insertless
control phage in this regard (Fig. 1C). CNGRC phage did not
inhibit the binding of iRGD phage to HUVECs (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, only in vitro deamidated CNGRC
and iNGR phage showed binding to immobilized avb3

Results
Design of iNGR peptide
We used 3 elements to create the iNGR peptide
(CRNGRGPDC): the NGR motif, a CendR motif (RNGR) overlapping with the NGR motif, and a cleavable consensus (GPD)
from the iRGD peptide. The cyclic conformation required
for high afﬁnity binding of NGR to CD13 (22) was obtained
through the addition of cysteines at the N- and C- terminus of
the peptide. We also prepared the truncated version of iNGR

integrin (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results suggest that
CNGRC and iNGR bind to the same primary receptor through
the NGR motif and that the conversion of asparagine to
aspartate does not take place during phage production,
puriﬁcation, storage, or during the incubations. Therefore,
the binding of CNGRC and iNGR to cells is not due to isoDGR
interacting with avb3/5 integrins.
The iNGR CendR motif interacts with NRPs and promotes
cell internalization
We constructed phage displaying a truncated version
of iNGR in which the CRNGR CendR motif occupies a
C-terminal position (iNGRt). This phage bound avidly to
HUVECs, likely due to an interaction with NRP-1 (Fig. 1A and
B). Indeed, iNGRt phage binding to HUVECs was reduced
by preincubation with a UV-inactivated phage expressing a
prototypic CendR motif peptide (RPARPAR) or a neutralizing NRP-1 antibody (Fig. 1B), indicating involvement of the
CendR/NRP-1 pathway. Preincubation with a phage displaying a peptide with a blocked CendR motif (RPARPARA),
and a control antibody, had no effect on iNGRt binding to
HUVECs. The binding of intact iNGR was not affected by
the UV-inactivated RPARPAR phage or NRP-1 antibody
showing that NRP-1 is not involved in the initial binding
of the peptide. Measuring phage internalization by incubating phage with HUVECs at 37 C, followed by a wash with a
low pH buffer to inactivate extracellular phage, showed
stronger internalization of iNGR and iNGRt than CNGRC
(Fig. 1D). Inhibition experiments showed that the internalization was mediated by the interaction of the CendR motif
with NRP-1. These results suggest that HUVECs express a
protease capable of activating the cryptic CendR motif
embedded in the iNGR peptide. Indeed, mass spectrometry
showed that upon incubation of HUVECs with FAM-iNGR
peptide, only the cleaved FAM-CRNGR fragment (m/z:
1076.527) but not the full-length peptide (m/z: 1445.065),
was present inside the cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). FAMCNGRC peptide (m/z: 1020.020) did not penetrate into the
cells. Direct proof that the CendR motif within the iNGR
peptide is capable of binding to NRPs was provided by
CRNGR phage binding to immobilized NRP-1 (Fig. 1E). This
phage also bound to NRP-2 (Fig. 1F). In agreement with the
ﬁnding that the motif R/KXXR/K has to be in a C-terminal
position to bind to NRPs (the Cend-Rule; ref. 3), only phage
expressing the iNGRt, and the analogous iRGDt, bound to
the NRPs, whereas the corresponding full-length peptides
showed only background binding. Interestingly, iNGRt
showed higher afﬁnity for NRP-1 and NRP-2 than iRGDt,
suggesting that a C-terminal arginine residue (CRNGR)
provides higher afﬁnity than lysine (CRGDK).
iNGR penetrates deeper into tumors than NGR
We have previously shown in ex vivo tumor penetration
assays that iRGD uses a CendR-mediated active transport
system to cross tumor barriers (5). To investigate the iNGRmediated penetration pathway, we conducted an ex vivo tumor
penetration assay of phage using explants of orthotopic 4T1
murine breast tumors (positive for expression of CD13 and

we titrated the phage recovered from tumors (Fig. 2B) and
determined the distribution of phage immunoreactivity
(Fig. 2C). The CendR-containing phage (iNGR and iRGD)
penetrated into the explants with similar patterns, whereas
non-CendR phage (CNGRC and control) remained at the

outer rim of the explants. These results suggest that iNGR
and iRGD share a similar CendR-mediated transport mechanism to penetrate tumor tissue.
Systemic iNGR selectively accumulates and penetrates
into tumors
Having determined that the CendR motif within the iNGR
peptide can be proteolytically activated to trigger interaction
with NRPs and penetration into cells and tissues, we assessed the homing of iNGR in vivo. Intravenously administered
iNGR phage accumulated within the tumor and penetrated
into the tumor stroma more than CNGRC phage (Fig. 3A and B,
top). The iNGRt phage also showed high tumor penetration,

presumably because of the high expression of NRP-1 on tumor
vasculature and tumor cells, but this phage also accumulated
in lungs and heart of the tumor mice. iNGR penetration
could be blocked by concomitantly administering a neutralizing anti-NRP-1 antibody, but not a control antibody (Fig. 3B,
bottom). Vascular targeting of iNGR was not inhibited by
the anti-NRP-1 treatment (arrows, Fig. 3B, left bottom), supporting the notion that the CendR activation occurs after iNGR
accomplishes NGR-dependent vascular targeting. Intravenously injected FAM-iNGR peptide also accumulated in 4T1
breast tumors (Fig. 3C) and BxPC-3 pancreatic tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5A) more strongly than FAM-CNGRC. FAMiNGR extravasation within tumor tissue was greater than

that of FAM-CNGRC (Fig. 3D). FAM-iNGR selectively penetrated into tumors and not into control organs (Fig. 3E).
Elongated iron oxide nanoparticles (nanoworms) coated with
iNGR also showed higher extravasation than CNGRC-NWs
(Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S5B). The nanoworms were
less efﬁcient than phage in penetrating the tissue, likely
because they are larger in size (nanoworms, 30  70/200 nm;
phage, 55 nm).
iNGR triggers tumor-speciﬁc penetration of coadministered compounds
The engagement of NRP-1 increases vascular permeability
(23), and iRGD triggers this phenomenon speciﬁcally in tumors
(5). We found that iNGR signiﬁcantly increased extravasation
and accumulation of the albumin-binding dye Evans blue in
4T1 tumors, but not in nontumor tissues. CNGRC or vehicle
alone had no effect on the biodistribution of the dye (Fig. 4A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S6). iNGR facilitated tumorspeciﬁc accumulation of Evans blue in CT26 colon and LLC
lung tumor models as well (Supplementary Fig. S7). We also
co-administered iNGR with nanoworms coated with a tumorhoming peptide, CGKRK (20), which brings the nanoworms to
tumor vessels but does not trigger extravasation. iNGR allowed

www.aacrjournals.org

the NWs to extravasate into the tumor parenchyma (Fig. 4C).
Finally, iNGR triggered more penetration of doxorubicin into
the tumors than doxorubicin alone or doxorubicin combined
with CNGRC (Fig. 4D).
iNGR enhances anticancer drug efﬁcacy
Having found that iNGR co-administration increased the
local accumulation of doxorubicin within tumors, we investigated the effect of iNGR on the activity of doxorubicin. We
treated orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor mice with a combination
of doxorubicin (3 mg/kg) and 4 mmol/kg of iNGR, a control
peptide, or PBS every other day. As shown in Fig. 5A, iNGR,
but not CNGRC, enhanced the antitumor effect of doxorubicin. iNGR alone had no effect on tumor growth. Loss of body
weight as an indicator of doxorubicin toxicity was not affected
by the peptide co-administration (Fig. 5B). These results show
the potential of iNGR as an adjuvant to increase the efﬁcacy of
co-administered anticancer drugs.

Discussion
We report here the design of a new tumor-penetrating
peptide, iNGR. The peptide was constructed by combining the

tumor-targeting motif NGR and tissue-penetrating CendR
motif into a 9-amino acid cyclic peptide. The iNGR peptide,
homed to tumor vessels, exited the vessels, and penetrated into
the tumor mass. It was able to take both coupled and coadministered payloads with it. When the co-administered
payload was a drug (doxorubicin), the efﬁcacy of the drug
increased. These results show that it is possible to use the
existing knowledge to construct a new tumor-speciﬁc, tissuepenetrating peptide.
The mechanisms underlying iNGR activity are similar to
those described for iRGD (4, 5). The receptor for the tumortargeting motif NGR is a variant form of aminopeptidase N (12).
The binding of iNGR to cultured cells was speciﬁcally inhibited
by CNGRC, indicating that iNGR binds to the same receptor.
NGR peptides are known to spontaneously undergo slow
deamidation of the asparagine residue into isoaspartic acid.
The resulting isoDGR peptides, like RGD peptides, bind to av
integrins. Our results exclude integrin involvement in the

binding of iNGR peptide and phage to cultured cells. It is also
unlikely that isoDGR formation affects the in vivo tumor
targeting of iNGR because the deamidation process takes
several hours (24), whereas the half-life of intravenously
injected peptides of the size of iNGR is only minutes (25).
Thus, iNGR and iRGD bind to different primary receptors
on cells.
Upon engagement of the iRGD peptide at the plasma
membrane of target cells, a proteolytic cleavage by a yet-tobe-identiﬁed enzyme(s) exposes the CendR sequence, which
subsequently binds to NRP-1 (4). Our evidence indicates that
the same mechanism operates with iNGR. First, phage displaying the predicted CendR product of iNGR, CRNGR (iNGRt)
bound to NRP-1 and NRP-2, and did so with a higher afﬁnity
than CRGDK fragment of iRGD. The reason for the difference
may be that a peptide with a C-terminal arginine binds more
efﬁciently to NRPs than a peptide with a lysine C-terminus (26).
Comparison of the tumor-homing efﬁcacy of iRGD with an
arginine or a lysine (CRGDK/RGPDC) showed that the lysinecontaining form was more effective in vivo (4). It may be that
other effects of the lysine residue, such as stronger integrin
binding or higher susceptibility to protease cleavage, overcome
the effect of lower afﬁnity for NRPs. Second, iNGR, both as a
synthetic peptide and on phage was taken up by cells in an
NRP-dependent manner. Third, we isolated the iNGRt CendR
fragment from inside cells treated with the intact iNGR peptide, as has been previously done with iRGD (4). Fourth, the
co-injection of iNGR phage with neutralizing anti-NRP-1
antibody resulted in a reduced extravasation of iNGR. These
results show that iNGRt, the active form of iNGR, is generated
through proteolysis and that the tumor-penetrating properties of iNGR are based on its ability to activate the CendR
pathway.
The activation of iNGR into iNGRt appears to take place
only in tumors because iNGR only accumulated in tumors.
In contrast, the truncated iNGRt form, while showing preferential homing to tumors, also accumulated in the lungs
and heart. This homing pattern reﬂects the expression of
NRP-1, which is universal in the blood vessels but particularly high in tumor vessels (27). The reason for the selective
activation of the cryptic CendR motif in tumors is likely to be
that binding to the primary receptor is needed for the activating proteolytic cleavage. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that an iRGD variant that does not bind to
integrins, but contains a CendR motif, does not penetrate
into cultured cells, whereas iRGD does (4). The nature of
the primary receptor does not seem to matter, as long as the
receptor is tumor speciﬁc. iRGD and iNGR bind to different
primary receptors, but both become activated in cell cultures and in tumors. Moreover, we have recently shown that
a previously identiﬁed tumor-homing peptide, CGNKRTRGC
(LyP-1; ref. 28) also penetrates into tumors through the
CendR/NRP mechanism (6). The primary receptor for this
peptide is p32/gC1qR/HABP1, a mitochondrial protein
expressed at the cell surface in tumors (29). Thus, our results
show that at least 3 different primary receptors can initiate
the sequence of events that leads to the NRP-dependent
activation of the CendR pathway in tumors. Importantly, the

De Novo Design of a Tumor-Penetrating Peptide

difference in the primary receptors allows us to differentially
target tumors or tumor areas based on receptor expression
patterns, providing multiple options to enhance tumor
therapy with tumor-speciﬁc CendR peptides.
The experiments with phage, ﬂuorophore-labeled peptide,
and nanoparticles showed the ability of iNGR to take coupled
payloads into the extravascular tumor tissue. Our results
further show that such enhanced delivery and tumor penetration also applies to compounds co-administered with iNGR.
Importantly, we showed this for doxorubicin, the antitumor
activity of which was increased by injecting the drug together
with iNGR.
The co-administration strategy has signiﬁcant advantages.
First, because chemical coupling is not needed, new chemical
entities are not created, providing a faster route for clinical
development. Second, unlike targeting of compounds chemically coupled to a homing element, the co-administration
process is not strictly dependent on the number of available
receptors, which seriously limits the amount of a drug that can
be delivered to a target (30).
Taken together, our results show that iNGR possesses
the same targeting ability as CNGRC, supplemented with
cell-internalizing and tumor-penetrating properties. This
transformation suggests an important principle: a targeting
peptide can be ad hoc improved by the addition of a CendR
motif, which endows the peptide with tissue-penetrating
properties and allows enhanced delivery of co-administered
compounds into a target tissue. Rational optimization of
targeting peptides in this manner may also have valuable
applications in other diseases.
