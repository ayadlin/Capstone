Abstract
A novel series of 4-arylaminoquinazolines were identified from
a cell-based screening assay as potent apoptosis inducers.
Through structure-activity relationship studies, MPC-6827
and its close structural analogue, MPI-0441138, were discovered as proapoptotic molecules and mitotic inhibitors with
potencies at low nanomolar concentrations in multiple tumor
cell lines. Photoaffinity and radiolabeled analogues of MPC6827 were found to bind a 55-kDa protein, and this binding was
competed by MPC-6827, paclitaxel, and colchicine, but not
vinblastine. MPC-6827 effectively inhibited the polymerization
of tubulin in vitro, competed with colchicine binding, and
disrupted the formation of microtubules in a variety of tumor
cell lines, which together showed the molecular target as
tubulin. Treatment of MCF-7 breast carcinoma or Jurkat
leukemia cells with MPC-6827 led to pronounced G2-M cell
cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Apoptosis, as determined by
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assay, was preceded by loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to nuclei, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. MPC-6827 was equipotent in an
in vitro growth inhibition assay in several cancer cell lines
regardless of the expression levels of the multidrug resistance
ABC transporters MDR-1 (Pgp-1), MRP-1, and BCRP-1. In B16F1 allografts and in OVCAR-3, MIAPaCa-2, MCF-7, HT-29, MDAMB-435, and MX-1 xenografts, statistically significant tumor
growth inhibition was observed with MPC-6827. These studies
show that MPC-6827 is a microtubule-disrupting agent with
potent and broad-spectrum in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic
activities and, therefore, MPC-6827 is a promising candidate
for development as a novel therapeutic for multiple cancer
types. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5865–71]

Introduction
Many of the chemotherapeutic agents presently in use for cancer
treatment were discovered from the screening of libraries for small
molecules that inhibit the growth of neoplastic cells. Subsequently,
it has been determined that many of the clinically useful cytotoxic
agents primarily act by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells (1–3).
Apoptotic cell death is the consequence of a series of precisely

regulated events that are frequently altered in tumor cells.
Activation of caspases is a critical event for apoptosis induction
(4, 5). The sequence of events that results in the activation of
caspases has been broadly categorized into two pathways: the
‘‘extrinsic’’ pathway, characterized by the engagement of cell
surface ‘‘death receptors’’ (6, 7), and the ‘‘intrinsic’’ mitochondrial
mediated pathway, characterized by the release of cytochrome c
from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol
(8–10). For either pathway, the ultimate activation of caspases
ensures apoptosis induction.
The principal proapoptotic chemotherapeutic agents used for
both childhood and adult cancers target tubulin, including the
taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel and the Vinca alkaloids vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine. Considering the clinical success of
these agents, tubulin represents one of the most highly validated
cancer targets identified to date (11, 12). Tubulin targeting agents
interfere with microtubule dynamics, leading to arrest of dividing
cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, which eventually results in
apoptotic cell death (13). However, emerging resistance to
antimitotic agents has limited their ultimate effectiveness (14),
leading to renewed interest in the discovery and development of
new agents that are active in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells and
that interact with tubulin at sites different from those of the
taxanes and Vinca alkaloids (15). This field has exploded in the last
few years, leading to the discovery of a variety of new smallmolecule inhibitors, which have shown promising antitumor
activity even in tumors expressing MDR phenotypes with the most
advance being the macrolide epothilones (16, 17). MPC-6827 has
displayed significant activity in inhibiting the growth of multiple
tumor lines in athymic nude mice, which include human breast
(MCF-7, MX-1, and MB-MDA-435), colon (HT-29), pancreas
(MIAPaCa-2), ovarian (OVCAR-3), and mouse melanoma (B16).
Here, we present a novel chemical class of compounds, represented
by the lead compound MPC-6827, which inhibit tubulin polymerization, are not substrates for ABC MDR transporters in vitro, and
display a broad spectrum of antitumor activity. Taken together,
these results suggest that MPC-6827 may be effective in the
treatment of multiple types of human tumors.

Materials and Methods
Chemical synthesis. MPC-6827 [N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N,2-dimethylquinazolin-4-amine; Fig. 1A ] was prepared via reaction of 4-chloro2-methylquinazoline with 4-methoxy-N -methylaniline. MPI-0441138
[2-chloro-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methylquinazolin-4-amine; Fig. 1A] was
prepared similarly via reaction of 2,4-dichloroquinazoline with 4-methoxyN-methylaniline. The 4-azido analogue MPI-0441264 [N-(4-azidophenyl)N,2-dimethylquinazolin-4-amine; Fig. 2A] was prepared via diazotization of
the corresponding 4-amino analogue [N-(4-aminophenyl)-N,2-dimethylquinazolin-4-amine] followed by treatment with sodium azide. The tritiated

were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
maintained following ATCC recommendations. NCI/ADR-RES cells were
obtained from National Cancer Institute (NCI; ref. 15). P388 and P388/ADR
cells were obtained from NCI (18). MCF-7/VP cells (19) were obtained from
Dr. Erasmus Schneider (Wadsworth Center, New York State Department
of Health, Albany, NY). MCF-7/MX cells (20) were obtained from Dr. K.
Cowan (University of Nebraska Medical Center, 986805 Nebraska Medical
Center, Omaha, NE). NCI/ADR-RES, MCF-7/MX, P388, and P388/ADR cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mmol/L glutaMAX, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, and 10 mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen). MCF-7/VP cells were
cultured in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2.5% horse serum, 2 mmol/L glutaMAX, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, and 10 mmol/L HEPES. All cells were
grown at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Caspase activation. Cells were incubated with the test compounds in
384-well plates for 24 h. Caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate N-(Ac-DEVD)N¶-ethoxycarbonyl-R110 (21) was then added, incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and fluorescent signal resulting from caspase activation was
measured using a fluorescent plate reader (Tecan Model Spectrafluor Plus).
Compounds were designated as active caspase inducers if the fluorescent
signal was at least 3-fold over background, based on previous demonstration that caspase-3/caspase-7 activation would yield at least this degree of
fluorogenic substrate cleavage (21). Active compounds were subsequently
confirmed at several concentrations to determine EC50 values. EC50 values
were determined by a sigmoidal dose-response calculation (XLFit3, IDBS)
and represent the concentration of compound that produces 50% the
maximum observed response.
Cell cycle analysis. Human Jurkat leukemia cells were used to determine
the effect of MPC-6827 on cell cycle and apoptosis. Cells were treated with
various concentrations of MPC-6827 for 18 h at 37jC or treated for 3 h,
washed, resuspended in growth media, and then incubated for 18 h at 37jC.
In experiments done to determine the effect of caspases in cell death, cells
were treated with 100 nmol/L MPC-6827 for 18 h or were pretreated with
10 Amol/L MX-1013, a pan-caspase inhibitor (21), before addition of
MPC-6827. Cells were harvested at 200  g and washed twice with
5 mmol/L EDTA/PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 300 AL of EDTA/PBS
and 700 AL of 100% ethanol, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and
centrifuged at 200  g, followed by removal of supernatant. A solution
containing 100 Ag/mL propidium iodide and 1 mg/mL RNase A was added
to the fixed cell pellets and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples
were then analyzed on a flow cytometer. Flow cytometric cell cycle
determinations were done on FACScalibur and data output was analyzed
using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson).
Identification of a cellular target for MPC-6827. Jurkat cells at
1  107/mL in RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum were treated with vehicle,
1 Amol/L MPC-6827, 1 or 10 Amol/L colchicine, 1 or 10 Amol/L vinblastine,
or 1 or 10 Amol/L paclitaxel for 1 h at 37jC, and then incubated with
100 nmol/L [3H]MPI-0441264 (16.7 Amol/L, 60 Ci/mmol, and 1 mCi/mL,
from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) for 3 h at 37jC. Covalent
cross-linking of [3H]MPI-0441264 was achieved by exposing cells to a shortwave UV source (254 nm) for 2 or 10 min at a distance of 3.5 cm. Cells
were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 200 AL of 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 mol/L NaCl,
0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA] plus 0.2 AL of protease
inhibitor cocktail for 30 min on ice. Lysates were then spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed to remove nuclei. The supernatant
was transferred to a new tube containing 200 AL of 2 Tris-glycine SDS
reducing sample buffer. The samples were then boiled for 5 min, and 10 AL
of the boiled samples were loaded onto a 4% to 12% Tris-glycine SDS gel.
The gel was subsequently stained with 1% Coomassie brilliant blue in 40%
methanol/7.5% acetic acid for 2 h and then destained in several changes of
40% methanol/7.5% acetic acid. The gel was then incubated in Amplify
(GE Healthcare) for 30 min at room temperature and then dried on
Whatman filter paper with a gel dryer at 80jC for 2 h. The dried gel was put
on Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare) in a film cassette for development at 80jC
for 5 days.

MPC-6827 Is a Novel Tubulin Targeting Agent
In vitro tubulin polymerization assay. MPC-6827 was assayed at
0.5, 5, or 50 Amol/L for effect on tubulin polymerization according to the
recommended procedure of the manufacturer (Cytoskeleton, #ML113, 1 mg,
MAP-rich). To 1 AL of each 100 stock of experimental compound in a
96-well plate was added 99 AL of supplemented tubulin supernatant.
Incubation was carried out at 37jC in a Molecular Devices plate reader,
with absorbance readings at 340 nm every minute for 1 h. The IC50 was the
concentration found to decrease the initial rate of tubulin polymerization
by 50% as calculated using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad).
Cellular tubulin staining. A549 cells were grown overnight on
18  18 mm coverslips. MPC-6827 was then added at a final concentration of 10 nmol/L for 1 or 3 h at 37jC. Coverslips were removed from
media and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in RPMI 1640 for 15 min at
37jC, washed thrice in 1 HBSS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X
100. Following three washes in 1 HBSS, coverslips were blocked with
1 HBSS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20
(blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked coverslips were
incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti–h-tubulin antibody (clone 2-2833; 1 Ag/mL; Sigma) in blocking solution at a dilution of 1:2,000. After
washing in 1 HBSS, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (H + L)
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1 Ag/mL; Molecular Probes) was added
in blocking solution to a final concentration of 2 Ag/mL, which also
contained Hoechst 33342 (2 Ag/mL). Immunofluorescence was analyzed
on the Everest Digital Microscopy Workstation (Intelligent Imaging
Innovations).
Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling assay. Cells were treated with 5 nmol/L MPI-0441138 for
72 h and fragmented DNA was assessed by using the terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay. In the TUNEL assay, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and then permeabilized with 70% ethanol (ApoBrdU
TUNEL Assay Kit, Molecular Probes Europe BV). Labeling reactions using
Alexa Fluor 488 dye–labeled anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibodies were done

according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). The fluoresceinlabeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson).
Apoptosis inducible factor and cytochrome c translocation. Cells
were treated with 5 nmol/L MPI-0441138 or vehicle for 1 h and then
fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed with
PBS and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.1% saponin in PBS containing
1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were incubated at
room temperature for 1 h with either rabbit anti–cytochrome c antibody
or rabbit anti–apoptosis inducible factor (AIF; Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.) at a concentration of 5.0 Ag/mL, washed twice, and then incubated
with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin/FITC swine F(ab¶)2 secondary antibody (DakoCytomation GmbH) for 30 min. All incubations were done at
room temperature. After washing, cells were analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy (Olympus IX71, Olympus Optical GmbH) using a blue filter of
470 to 490 nm.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial
membrane potential (DW m) was determined by staining of the cells with
5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbicyanin iodide
(JC-1). 22Rv1, MDA-MB-231, Caco-2, and Du145 cells were treated with
5 nmol/L MPI-0441138 for 12, 24, 48, or 72 h at 37jC. Cells were then
incubated with BD MitoSensor reagent following the manufacturer’s
recommended conditions (JC-1, BD Biosciences). From each sample,
25,000 events were collected to measure fluorescence in the FL-2 channel
after suitable compensation.
MDR testing. Exponentially growing MCF-7, NCI/ADR-RES, MCF-7/MX,
MCF-7/VP, P388, and P388/ADR cells were seeded at 5,000 per well in a
96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate and, 24 h later, culture medium was
replaced with fresh medium and varying concentrations of test compound.
Cellular viability was determined 72 h after addition of test compound by
measuring intracellular ATP with the ATPLite assay system (Perkin-Elmer).
All compounds were tested in quadruplicate. The effect of compounds on
cell viability was calculated by comparing the ATP levels of cells exposed to
test compound with those of cells exposed to vehicle. A semi-log plot of

(Innovative Research of America) 48 h before the injection of cells. MX-1
tumors were passaged serially in CD1 nu/nu mice. For this study, tumors
from several animals were excised. The viable portion of the tumor was cut
into pieces (f30 mm3) and implanted into the right lateral mammary pad
of each animal using a trocar. In all the allografts and xenografts, tumors
were allowed to grow to f100 mm3 and then were placed into test groups
(N = 10). The dose, route of administration, and dosing regimen for each
study are indicated in Table 2. The mice were observed daily for mortality
and signs of toxicity. Tumors and body weights were measured from day 1
to the end of study with the frequency measurements determined by the
rate of growth of the tumor. Tumor growth was monitored using external
measurements with a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula p/6 (width2  length), where width represents the smaller tumor
diameter. Statistical ANOVA with unadjusted pairwise comparison was
done using SAS software. These studies conformed to the recommendations
set forth in the USPHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (22).

Results and Discussion
MPC-6827 is a potent activator of caspases in various tumor
cell lines. A novel series of 4-arylaminoquinazolines were
identified as potent activators of caspases in a cell-based screening assay. The initial hit compound was identified in highthroughput screening by measuring the induction of apoptosis in
T47D breast cancer cells using a profluorescent substrate (21).
MPI-0441138 and MPC-6827 analogues (Fig. 1A) of the original
screening hit showed activities in the low nanomolar range in the
caspase activation assay (1.4 F 0.3 and 2.5 F 0.4 nmol/L,
respectively). To investigate the rate and potency of cell killing,
Jurkat cells were exposed to varying concentrations of MPC-6827
for 3 or 18 h. Although either 3 or 18 h of exposure showed
equivalent maximal induction of cell death, MPC-6827 was
apparently more potent after the longer length of exposure
(Fig. 1B). To confirm that caspase activation was required for
the MPC-6827–mediated induction of cell death, we tested the
effect of MX-1013 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone), a pan-caspase inhibitor previously described to inhibit
caspase activation (23). In the presence of both MPC-6827 and
MX-1013, cell death of Jurkat cells was 11% as compared with 68%
cell death in the presence of MPC-6827 alone (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, with the addition of MX-1013, the majority of MPC6827–treated Jurkat cells were now arrested in G2-M (Fig. 1C),
indicating that the cells treated with MPC-6827 underwent G2-M
arrest before caspase activation and cell death. Taken together,
these results support an apoptotic mechanism of cell killing by
MPC-6827.
MPC-6827 competes with a radiolabeled and photoreactive
analogue for binding to a 55-kDa protein. An azido photoaffinity analogue of MPC-6827, MPI-0441264, was synthesized,
which remained potent in the caspase activation assay (data not
shown). A tritiated version was also prepared and used to identify
the molecular target of MPC-6827 ([3H]MPI-0441264; Fig. 2A).
Autoradiography of electrophoresed lysates from Jurkat cells
treated with [3H]MPI-0441264 revealed a prominent band at an
apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa (Fig. 2B). To assess the
specificity of the labeling by the affinity probe, Jurkat cells were
pretreated with 1 Amol/L MPC-6827 before incubation with
[3H]MPI-0441264 and photoactivation. MPC-6827 significantly
reduced the amount of photolabeled 55-kDa protein (Fig. 2B).
Similar results were obtained with two additional azido photoaffinity analogues of MPC-6827 in which the azido group was
located at different positions on the molecule (not shown).

www.aacrjournals.org

Due to the apparent molecular weight of the bound protein and
the cell cycle profile of the compound treated cells, the 55-kDa
bound protein was suspected to be tubulin. Therefore, compounds
known to bind tubulin, such as colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, were tested for the ability to compete with the [3H]MPI0441264 labeling. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 55-kDa labeled protein
was clearly competed by MPC-6827, colchicine, and paclitaxel, but
not by vinblastine, suggesting the 55-kDa band was likely tubulin.
MPC-6827 disrupts tubulin polymerization in vitro, binds
to the colchicine-binding site, and disrupts microtubules in
intact cells. To confirm that MPC-6827 bound tubulin and altered
polymerization, we evaluated its effect on tubulin polymerization
in an in vitro assay. MPC-6827 was tested at 0.5, 5, and 50 Amol/L,
and 5 Amol/L was sufficient to completely inhibit tubulin
polymerization (Fig. 2C). Although this potency for inhibition of
tubulin polymerization seemed to be low, it is likely not
inconsistent with cellular potency for apoptosis induction,
considering the high concentration of tubulin in the polymerization assay.
The in vitro studies clearly showed that MPC-6827 binds to
tubulin and disrupts microtubule formation. We also wanted to
determine if MPC-6827 was able to inhibit microtubule formation
in intact cells. Microtubule disruption was rapidly induced in
human A549 non–small-cell lung carcinoma cells, treated with
vehicle or 10 nmol/L MPC-6827, with marked disruption after
1 h and complete disruption by 3 h (Fig. 2D). This microtubule
disruption activity is most consistent with MPC-6827 exerting
functional effects through the colchicine rather than the taxane
binding site on tubulin because colchicine is known to inhibit and
taxanes are known to stabilize tubulin polymerization (9). Rather
than direct competition, the ability of paclitaxel to prevent labeling
of the 55-kDa protein in the cellular assay may be due to
microtubule stabilization from paclitaxel treatment that can block
MPC-6827 from binding to the colchicine site.
MPI-0441138–induced cell death shows multiple hallmarks
of apoptosis. MPI-0441138 is a close analogue of MPC-6827 and
shows similar caspase activation potency. To determine whether

MPI-0441138 induced apoptosis in tumor cells, a variety of markers
of apoptosis were evaluated in prostate carcinoma Du145 and
22Rv1 cells, colorectal carcinoma Caco-2 cells, or breast carcinoma
MDA-MB-231 cells. MPI-0441138 induced DNA fragmentation in all
of the tumor cell lines investigated, with the most prominent
responses observed in 22Rv1 and MDA-MB-231 cells (61 F 6.5%
and 51 F 6.0%, respectively; Fig. 3A). Induction of DNA
fragmentation in 22Rv1 and MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied
by robust caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 3B). Changes in mitochondrial membrane
potential (DW m) in the treated cancer cells were also assessed,
with MPI-0441138 significantly altering DW m in all cancer cells
after 24 h. The most prominent DW m dissipation was observed in
22Rv1, MDA-MB-231, and Caco-2 cells with a loss of 69%, 66%, and
79%, respectively. Du145 cells revealed the lowest dissipation of the
DW m after 24 h (47%), but this effect increased to 78% after
48 h (Fig. 3C). The effect of MPI-0441138 on AIF and cytochrome c
translocation from mitochondria to cytosol and nucleus was
assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. The most active
translocation of AIF was observed in MDA-MB-231 and Caco-2
cells. The most active translocation of AIF was observed in MDAMB-231 and Caco-2 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells also revealed
translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to nucleus.
22Rv1 and Du145 cells showed slightly lagging AIF and cytochrome
c translocation on MPC-6827 treatment (Fig. 3D). The microscopic
analysis of translocation of AIF and cytochrome c was confirmed
by cellular fractionation and Western blot analysis (data not
shown). Collectively, these results show that MPI-0441138, and
therefore MPC-6827 by analogy, induces cell death through a
mechanism consistent with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway.
MPC-6827 is effective in MDR cancer cell lines in vitro.
Human breast carcinoma NCI/ADR-RES (previously called MCF-7/
ADR) and human leukemia P388-ADR cell lines overexpressing
MDR-1 (Pgp-1) were tested for resistance to MPC-6827 and the
tubulin-interacting chemotherapeutics vinblastine and docetaxel.
MPC-6827 showed similar growth inhibition against P388 and
P388/ADR with an IC50 of 1.5 nmol/L. MPC-6827 inhibited the
growth rate of MCF-7 and NCI/ADR-RES cells, with IC50 values of
2.1 and 1.5 nmol/L, respectively. Vinblastine was much less active
against the MDR-1–overexpressing cells with IC50 values of 186 and
551 nmol/L for P388/ADR and NCI/ADR-RES cells, respectively,

as compared with 1.5 and 0.6 nmol/L for P388 and MCF-7 cells.
Docetaxel was also less active in the MDR-1–overexpressing cells
with IC50 values of 83 and 340 nmol/L for P388/ADR and NCI/ADRRES cells, respectively, versus 6.8 and 1.4 nmol/L for P388 and
MCF-7 cells (Table 1). MPC-6827 also showed similar growth
inhibition in MCF-7 and the BCRP-1–overexpressing cell lines.
Irinotecan and epirubicin, which are substrates of the BCRP-1
pump (24), were less active against the BCRP-1–overexpressing cell
line MCF-7/MX with IC50 values of 220 and 1,500 nmol/L, as
opposed to 16 and 50 nmol/L for MCF-7 cells, respectively.
MPC-6827 showed similar cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and the
MRP-1–overexpressing cell line MCF-7/VP, with IC50 values of
2.1 and 1.3 nmol/L for MCF-7 and MCF-7/VP cells, respectively.
Epirubicin, a substrate of the MRP-1 pump (25), was less active
against MCF-7/VP cells with an IC50 of 960 nmol/L as compared
with 150 nmol/L for MCF-7 cells. These results show that MPC6827 is not a substrate for the MDR transporters Pgp-1, BCRP-1,
and MRP-1 in human cancer cell lines in vitro.
MPC-6827 inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The in vivo efficacy
of MPC-6827 was studied in s.c. allograft and xenograft models
using mouse B16 melanoma and human breast (MCF-7, MX-1, and
MB-MDA-435), colon (HT-29), pancreas (MIAPaCa-2), and ovarian
(OVCAR-3) tumor cell lines. After implantation into the right flank
region of athymic nude mice, tumors were allowed to grow to an
average volume of 100 mm3 before beginning treatment with MPC6827. The results of each of the allograft and xenograft studies are
summarized in Table 2 and an example result from a xenograft
study is shown in Fig. 4. These data indicate that MPC-6827 was
efficacious in inhibiting the growth of a broad panel of tumor types.
These studies show that MPC-6827 acts through binding the
colchicine site on h-tubulin, inhibiting tubulin polymerization and
leading to G2-M arrest and apoptosis, which is activated through
the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. MPC-6827 also showed
efficacy in vitro against tumor cells overexpressing the three main
ABC transporters responsible for MDR, and, therefore, MPC-6827
may prove effective against drug-resistant tumors in the clinic.
Importantly, MPC-6827 displayed significant inhibition of the
growth of a broad spectrum of solid tumor types in xenograft
models.
Currently, the macrolide epothilones are the most advanced new
tubulin targeting agents in the clinic (26). Epothilones are
chemically distinct from taxanes but bind to the same binding

NOTE: MPC-6827 treatment significantly inhibits the growth of established tumor allografts and xenografts in athymic mice. The indicated tumors were
established as s.c. allografts or xenografts in athymic nude mice. Treatment with i.v. MPC-6827 was initiated on the day the average tumor volume
achieved 100 mm3 (N = 10). The subsequent maximal tumor growth inhibition values are listed with the day the measurement was made post-initial
dose in parentheses.

region on h-tubulin and exert their biological effects by stabilizing
microtubules. The potential advantages of the epothilones over the
taxanes are better aqueous solubility, greatly reduced affinity
toward drug resistance–mediating ABC transporters, and significant activity against taxane-resistant tumor cells (27, 28). MPC6827 is unique from the epothilones in that it binds to the
colchicine site on h-tubulin and is an inhibitor of microtubule
formation. Although MPC-6827 is equally potent in cell lines
regardless of ABC transporter expression, its activity in xenograft
models using taxane-resistant tumor cells has yet to be determined.
