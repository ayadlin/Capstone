ABSTRACT
Recently, MET exon 14 deletion (METex14del) has been postulated to be one
potential mechanism for MET protein overexpression. We screened for the presence of
METex14del transcript by multiplexed fusion transcript analysis using nCounter assay
followed by confirmation with quantitative reverse transcription PCR with correlation
to MET protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MET amplification by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We extracted RNAs from 230 patients enrolled
onto the prospective molecular profiling clinical trial (NEXT-1) (NCT02141152) between
November 2013 and August 2014. Thirteen METex14del cases were identified including
3 gastric cancer, 4 colon cancer, 5 non-small cell lung cancer, and one adenocarcinoma
of unknown primary. Of these 13 METex14del cases, 11 were MET IHC 3+ and 2 were
2+. Only one out of the 13 METex14del cases was MET amplified (MET/CEP ratio > 2.0).
Growths of two (gastric, colon) METex14del+ patient tumor derived cell lines were
profoundly inhibited by both MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a monoclonal antibody
targeting MET. In conclusion, METex14del is a unique molecular aberration present in
gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies corresponding with overexpression of MET protein
but rarely with MET amplification. Substantial growth inhibition of METex14del+ patient
tumor derived cell lines by several MET targeting drugs strongly suggests METex14del
is a potential actionable driver mutation in GI malignancies.

aberration is the overexpression of the MET protein as
determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) which may be
associated with MET amplification. MET amplification is
present in about 2.6% among 1,115 patient tumors assayed
[2]. For example, the frequency of MET amplification is rare

in gastroesophageal/gastric cancer [3] while MET protein
overexpression has been reported in higher incidence [4].
The discordance between low MET amplification and high
MET protein expression indicates there are other potential
mechanisms that can lead to MET overexpression. One such
mechanism is MET exon14 deletion (METex14del) where
part of the transmembrane portion and region for the Casitas
B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) E3 ligase-mediated degradation
is deleted leading to delay degradation of MET and hence
its overexpression (Supplementary Figure S1) [5, 6].
METex14del was initially described in 2006 in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was caused by
mutation in the splice donor site in intron 14 and intronic
sequence deletions around MET exon 14 [5]. The presence
of METex14del in NSCLC has subsequently been confirmed
by RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing [7, 8].
Additionally, METex14del has been reported in gastric
cancer (GC) cell line Hs746T [9, 10] and neuroblastoma
[11] indicating this is a potential common mechanism for
a variety of tumors to delay the ubiquitination and downregulation of MET protein leading to its overexpression [5].

We investigated patients with metastatic solid
malignancies primarily gastrointestinal (GI) and
lung malignancies for the presence of METex14del
using multiplexed fusion transcript detection assay
and then confirmed with reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) correlated the MET protein expression and MET
amplification in METex14del+ cases. We further generated
patient derived tumor cell lines and screened them for the
presence of METex14del and investigated the consequence
of MET inhibition in these METex14del+ cells lines.

RESULTS
The patient cohort from the NEXT-1 trial
(NCT02141152), which is an actively enrolling clinical
trial for genomic profiling in cancer patients, was used
(Figure 1). Of 428 patients enrolled and screened,
sufficient RNAs for multiplexed fusion transcript detection
analysis by nCounter assay were available in 230 patients
(Table 1). The detailed probe design for multiplexed
fusion transcript assay surveying for ALK, ROS1, RET,

(MET/CEP7 ~12.8) and strong MET overexpression.
For colon cancer, 4 patients were METex14del positive
(Tables 2 and 3). All of the METex14del+ (or positive)
colon cancer patients were not MET amplified and all
but one were MET IHC 3+. KRAS was wild-type in all
4 colon cancer patients but BRAF V600E was detected
in two of the 4 cases. Interestingly, all 4 colon cancer
METex14+cases were left-sided colon cancer. For NSCLC,
5 of 51 (9.8%) patients were METex14del+ and none of the
patients had concomitant MET amplifications. The median
age for the five patients was 49 years and four patients
(80%) were never-smokers (Table 2). Of the METex14del+
NSCLC patients, one patient had concomitant EGFR
deletion mutation in exon 19 and T790M within exon
20. None of the METex14del NSCLC patients had
concomitant KRAS mutations or MET amplification.

NTRK1, and NTRK3 is provided in Supplementary
Table S1. Of the multiplexed fusion assay, a nanostring
probe to detect any 141bp METex14del transcript
(p.982_1028del47, c.2942 (Supplementary Table S1)
was included. Of the 230 tumor specimens screened, 86
specimens were freshly frozen tissues and 144 specimens
were from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissues. In parallel, we screened fifty patient derived tumor
cell (PDC) lines generated from the SMC Biomarker study
(NCT01831609) for METex14del. The SMC Oncology
Biomarker study is an ongoing study which enrolls
metastatic solid cancer patients with malignant ascites,
malignant pleural effusion, endoscopic biopsies or surgical
specimens for PDC model establishments (Figure 1 for
Study Flow Chart).
Of the 230 tumor cohort (86 fresh frozen tissue and
144 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues), 219 were
finally included in the analysis as 11 samples failed to pass
QC (quality control). With initial screening of multiplexed
nCounter fusion transcript analysis, 26 were detected as
potential positive cases for METex14del with high fusion
transcript mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure S2)
and 13 (5.7%) patients were eventually confirmed to
be METex14del+ by quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): 3 gastric carcinoma
(GC), 4 colon, 5 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and one adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (ACUP).
Among these 13 METex14del cases, 11 cases were MET
IHC 3+ and 2 cases were MET IHC 2+. Only one of the 13
METex14del+ cases had concomitant MET amplifications
(Table 2). All METex14del cases were negative for ALK,
ROS1, RET, NTRK1, and NTRK3 fusion.
All 13 METex14del cases were further confirmed
by qualitative RT-PCR using probes overlapping an
exon 13–15 junction, a fusion transcript caused by exon
14 skipping. In all cases, although the absolute Ct (cycles
to threshold) values of RT-PCR showed relatively high
around 32, there was definite amplification of target
sequences. Deep sequencing targeting whole MET gene
including intron using DNAs from GI cancers, there were
many mutations in the introns (Table 3). Interestingly, all
our GI samples harbored c.3082+811A TTTTAACA >
GGTTTGAT mutations on intron 14 region of MET.
A total of 3 out of 42 GC patients were METex14del
positive (Table 3). All GC cases were MET IHC 3+ and
the only case in the series with MET amplification. For
example, one case was a 27-year old male patient who
presented with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and
massive malignant ascites and died shortly after diagnosis.
His tumor showed strong MET overexpression by IHC
(3+) but no MET amplification by FISH (Figure 2a and 2b
(with both amplification and METex14+), Table 3). PDC
cell lines were generated from his malignant ascites and
investigated for anti-tumor activity by MET inhibitors
(below). The second METex14del case was a 67-year old
male patient who also presented with poorly differentiated

METex14del patient derived tumor cell lines
We identified 5 with high METex14 transcript
expressions and further confirmed by RT-PCR (Table 1,
Supplementary Figure S2). Of the 5 PDC cell lines, four
METex14del+ cell lines were tested for potential antitumor efficacy of c-MET inhibitors, crizotinib (small
molecule) and SAIT301 (monoclonal antibody) [6].
In Figure 3D, the expressions of MET protein in GC and
CRC PDC cell lines were confirmed using Western blot
analysis. Crizotinib, a small molecule targeting MET
as well as ALK [12–14], led to dose-dependent growth
inhibition both in GC and CRC PDCs (Figure 3A). We
further tested otherMET inhibitors such as PHA-665752
and cabozantinib (XL184) (Supplementary Figure 3A
and 3B); PHA-665752 is a small molecule inhibitor that
specifically targets MET, and cabozantinib is a small
molecule inhibitor that targets the MET, VEGFR2, and Ret
kinases [15]. PHA-665752 and cabozantinib demonstrated
potent growth inhibition in METex14+ GC and CRC
PDCs whereas lapatinib, an EGFR and HER2 inhibitor,
and cetuximab (Erbitux), an EGFR targeting monoclonal
antibody exhibited no such effects (Supplementary
Figure S3C). Other PDC line data including melanoma
and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are provided
in Supplementary Figure S4. Taken together, these
experimental results implicate anti-MET drugs specific
inhibition of METex14del+ patient derived cell lines.
Previously reported anti-MET antibody, SAIT301
promotes a Cbl-independent MET degradation pathway
and internalization of MET without ubiquitination [6].
Splice mutations of exon 14 have been associated with a
deletion of the juxtamembrane domain of MET resulting
in the loss of interaction with Cbl and Cbl-dependent
MET degradation through ubiquitination. We tested
SAIT301 in the METex14del+ GC and CRC PDCs to
further confirm its Cbl-independent Met degradation
mechanism. As shown in Figure 3B and 3C, SAIT301

demonstrated potent growth inhibition of both GC and
CRC PDCs whereas 5D5, another bivalent Met targeting
antibody, exhibited no proliferation inhibitory effects.
To determine antibody mediated down-regulation of
MET, we measured the total MET levels in GC and
CRC METex14del+ PDCs following SAIT301 treatment

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 3D). SAIT301 antibody dramatically reduced
MET protein levels. In addition, phosphorylation of Akt,
one of major signaling mediators of MET RTK, was
also significantly inhibited by treatment with SAIT301.
In conclusion, these results confirm that SAIT301
induces degradation of MET in METex14+ PDCs by

Patients with metastasis of solid cancers were
enrolled onto the NEXT-1 trial [NCT#02141152] at
Samsung Medical Center. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of the Samsung Medical Center.
All study participants provided written informed consent
before study entry. Briefly, patients with metastatic solid
cancer were eligible to enter the study. From November
2013 to August 2014, 428 patients were enrolled. of 428,
230 patients cohort with available tissue specimens for
RNA extractions were included in this screening project.

RNAs were reverse transcribed using a superscript
III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). For validation of nanostring results, we designed
forward primer for exon 13 of MET, GFPT1 F
(5′-TGGGTTTTTCCTGTGGCTGAA-3′), reverse primer
for exon 15 of MET (5′- GCATGAACCGTTCTGAG
ATGAATT-3′) and probes overlapping an exon 13-exon
15 junction (5′- AAGCAAATTAAAGATCAGTTTCC-3′).
GAPDH gene (ID; Hs99999905_m1) was used as an
endogenous control. TaqMan probes were labelled with
the reporter dye molecule FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)
at the 5′ end and with TaqMan minor groove binder

We performed nCounter assays (NanoString,
Seattle, WA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction in
duplicate. Total RNA was extracted from fresh tumor tissue
(tumor content > 70%) or from one to four FFPE tissue
sections (4 μm thick) using the High Pure RNA Paraffin
kit (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany). After RNA
extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocol, we
added additional DNase treatment. RNA concentration

CA). For the MET WT control, Ct from MET WT P/P
mix should be in range between 22 and 28, and Ct from
METex14del P/P mix should be “undetermined”. For the
METex14del Control, Ct from MET WT P/P mix should
be between 16 and 22; the Ct from METex14del P/P mix
should be between 26 and 32. If the Ct values for controls
fall outside the expected range then that run should not be
used for evaluation of test samples.

Biomarker study (NCT#01831609, clinicaltrials.gov).
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Samsung Medical Center. The cells were cultured
in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 0.5 μg/ ml of hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich), 5
μg/ ml of insulin(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 5
ng of EGF and FGF (PeproTech). Cell proliferation in
response to antibody treatment in vitro was assessed by
a CTG (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) assay according to
manufacturer instructions. Cells were plated at a density
of 5 × 105 cells in FBS 10% (v/v) RPMI 1640 medium
onto a 96-well plate (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA,
USA). After 24 h incubation, treated antibodies or small
molecules diluted in 10% FBS (v/v) RPMI medium were
added. After 5 days incubation, 100 μl of the CTG reagent
was added to each well followed by incubation at RT
for 30 min. The luminescence signal was recorded using
Envision 2104 Multi-label Reader (Perkin Elmer, Foster
City, CA, USA).

FISH was performed using dual-color DNAspecific MET/CEP7 probes (Abnova, Walnut, CA, USA)
as described previously [11]. Two pathologists (S.A and
M.H) counted the numbers of MET and chromosome
7 centromere probe (CEP7) signals (1 for individual signals,
6 for small clusters and 12 for big clusters) in 20 inter-phase
tumor cell nuclei, and the mean number of MET and CEP7
copies per nucleus were determined, along with the ratio.
Normal MET/CEP7 signals (one to two copies per cell)
in the various non-neoplastic cells served as the internal
positive control. We defined MET gene amplification as a
MET/CEP7 ratio > 2.0 in 20 tumor nuclei and polysomy-7
were regarded as negative for gene amplification.

Immunoblot analysis
Total proteins from PDCs were isolated using RIPA
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and protein
concentrations were determined according to Bradford
procedure using a Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Thirty μg of proteins were
subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
and electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and
probed overnight at 4 °C with a Specific antibodies: pMET
(Tyr 1234/1235), pAkt (Ser473), Akt(C67E7), pERK1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), GAPDH
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA), and
MET from Abcam (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and MET
(C-28) from Santa Cruz biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), and beta actin from Sigma Aldrich. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Vector,
Burlingame, CA, USA) were used as a secondary
antibody, and signals were detected by chemiluminescence
using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA), and visualized by using LAS-4000
(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

DISCUSSION
The Met proto-oncogene is encoded by 21 exons
spanned by 20 introns [7]. The transmembrane domain
of MET is encoded by the whole of exon 13 and part
of exon 14. Met exon 14 deletion thus results in an in
frame deletion of 47 amino acids in the juxtamembrane
region which contains the domain. The MET deletion
mutant, while displaying decreased Cbl binding, leads
to prolonged protein stability, extended cell signaling
on ligand stimulation, and increased tumorigenicity
[9]. The incidence of METex14del was estimated to be
3.5% in NSCLC [5] and 1.9% in neuroblastoma [11].
Recently, analysis of tumor genomic profiles from 38,028
patients identified 221 cases with METex14 mutations
(0.6%), including 126 distinct sequence variants in lung
adenocarcinoma (3.0%), other lung neoplasms (2.3%),
brain glioma (0.4%), and tumors of unknown primary
origin (0.4%) [21]. To date, METex14del has not been
reported in either gastric or colon cancer patients. This is
the first report that identified METex14del at a frequency
of approximately 5% in both gastric and colon cancer
in addition to NSCLC. All METex14del+ cases also
over-expressed MET protein with only one case showed
MET amplification consistent with the hypothesis that
METex14del leads to MET over-expression without
the need for concurrent MET amplification. In addition,
METex14del occurs exclusively to ALK, ROS1, NTRK1,
NTRK3 or RET fusions indicating METex14del is likely
a driver mutation and defines a unique molecular subset of
gastric and colon cancers.
In GC, only Hs746T cell line exhibited both
splice-site mutations and MET amplification with
MET protein overexpression [9]. We are the first group
to report on three GC cases (4.8%) with METex14del
and strong MET protein overexpression by IHC. We

performed MET exon 14 Sanger sequencing with
gDNAs and cDNAs, but failed to detect mutations in
our GI METex14del+cancer samples (data not shown).
Given the low sensitivity of Sanger sequencing (<12%)
and low Ct values in our RT-PCR results, we postulate
that METex14del+ tumor population is present in small
subpopulation of tumors. Furthermore, we also report
c.3082+811A TTTTAACA > GGTTTGAT mutations on
intron 14 region of MET with variant allele frequencies
around 10%. This intronic mutation is a novel mutation,
which has not been reported in COSMIC and TCGA
lung adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Table S2). We
found that this mutation site is important where proteins
including well known splicing factors such as Jun, and
Fox, etc. bind. ChIP-Seq dataset of ENCODE project
provides strong evidences and the specific intronic
mutation site reported here exists in the middle of the
protein binding sites (Supplementary Figure S5). We
assume that this 8bp mutation on this binding site would
affect decreased protein binding affinity of these proteins
and may cause exon 14 skipping in small subpopulations
of tumor, especially given the tumor heterogeneity in
GI cancer.
In two PDC cell lines with METex14del+ without
concurrent MET amplification, tumor growths were
profoundly inhibited by both MET tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and a MET targeting monoclonal antibody-.
Our study is the first proving efficacy of MET inhibitors
or monoclonal antibody in human GI PDC lines with
METex14del that over-expressed MET but did not
have MET amplification. Furthermore the in vitro
cell line inhibition data indicated that METex14del
is potentially an actionable driver mutation in GI
malignancies. This finding provides new opportunities
for clinical trials on MET inhibitors in metastatic GC
to include not only MET amplified GC, but also MET
over-expressed, MET non-amplified and METex14del+
GC. So far all METex14del+ cases had concurrent
MET over-expression, it remained to be determined if
METex14del. Now, we developed screening algorithm
to detect METex14del for screening oncology patients.
First, we screen MET overexpression by IHC and select
MET-positive (≥ 2+) cases.4 In IHC-positive cases,
we perform FISH to exclude MET amplification as a
cause of MET overexpression. In cases without MET
amplification, we perform custom-designed and RTPCR using mRNAs from tumor to detect METex14del
transcripts. For RT-PCR positive cases, we sequence
them to find underlying cause of METex14 alterations
at the DNA level.
In summary this report supports that the aberration
in Cbl-mediated negative regulation of MET can indeed
result in MET protein overexpression and subsequent
addiction of tumor cells to MET signaling and may
serve as an actionable driver mutation in a subset of GI
malignancies.
