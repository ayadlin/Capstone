Abstract
Clinical studies converge on the observation that circulating
cytokines are elevated in most cancer patients by anti–
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. However,
the source of these molecules and their relevance in tumor
escape remain unknown. We examined the gene expression
profiles of cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages in
tumor biopsies before and 12 days after monotherapy with
the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab in patients with rectal
carcinoma. Bevacizumab up-regulated stromal cell–derived
factor 1A (SDF1A), its receptor CXCR4, and CXCL6, and downregulated PlGF, Ang1, and Ang2 in cancer cells. In addition,
bevacizumab decreased Ang1 and induced neuropilin 1
(NRP1) expression in tumor-associated macrophages. Higher
SDF1A plasma levels during bevacizumab treatment significantly associated with distant metastasis at three years. These
data show that VEGF blockade up-regulates inflammatory
pathways and NRP1, which should be evaluated as potential
targets for improving anti-VEGF therapy. [Cancer Res
2009;69(20):7905–10]

Introduction
Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab—an anti–vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (Genentech)—with
standard chemotherapy has proven efficacious in multiple
advanced cancers (1). However, overall survival benefit is modest,
and even for responding patients, the benefit is often short lived.
Moreover, adjuvant bevacizumab with chemotherapy did not result
in an overall statistically significant prolongation in disease-free
survival (DFS) at 3 years in colorectal cancer (2). The angiogenic
pathway targeted might be insufficient because an advanced tumor
may use multiple pathways for blood vessel formation (3).
Alternatively, the tumor might switch from the targeted pathway
to another pathway that supports its acquisition of new vessels.
Increases in key mediators of angiogenesis in circulation have been

reported in multiple studies of anti-VEGF agents in patients with
cancer, but it is unclear if they originate from the tumor or directly
affect the tumor (1). Plasma stromal cell–derived factor 1a (SDF1a)
and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) seem to associate with
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy in patients with glioblastoma,
whereas SDF1a and interleukin (IL)-6 associate with progression of
hepatocellular carcinoma after antiangiogenic therapy (4, 5). These
findings are in line with preclinical data suggesting a potential role
for bFGF and other cytokines beyond VEGF in tumor angiogenesis
(6, 7). However, the pathways that are activated after VEGF blockade
in human tumors remain unknown.
Identifying pathways of resistance could help optimize the
sequencing of different antiangiogenic agents already approved
and/or currently under development. Gene expression profiling
studies are frequently used to identify new candidate genes for
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. However, a common problem in the analysis of changes in tumor tissue is their
spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Laser capture microdissection
(LCM) can isolate highly pure cell populations from a heterogeneous tissue section, permitting gene expression profiling of specific
cell populations. Therefore, we used LCM to explore changes in
tissue biomarkers in response to bevacizumab in rectal carcinoma
patients enrolled in a phase II study of bevacizumab monotherapy
followed by bevacizumab with chemoradiation (8). The unique
design of this trial permitted us to compare the expression of 20
angiogenic cytokines and their receptors in cancer cells and tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) in tumor biopsies before and after
bevacizumab monotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Biopsies. Rectal tumor biopsies were obtained with informed consent—
after approval by the National Cancer Institute-Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program and Institutional Review Boards of Massachusetts General
Hospital and Duke University—before, and then 12 d after the first
bevacizumab infusion, using flexible sigmoidoscopy to visualize the tumor.
Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding or snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC.
LCM. For LCM, frozen tumor sections were air dried and fixed in 70%
ethanol. Slides were incubated with anti–human CD68/macrosialin rat
antibody (1:10 dilution in blocking serum supplemented with SuperaseIn
RNase inhibitor; 0.4 units/mL; Serotec), then with biotinylated rabbit antirat IgG (20 mg/mL), and finally, Vectastain ABC Elite kit and 3,3¶diaminobenzidine chromogenic substrate were used for development.
Laser capture was done using Veritas Microdissection System (Arcturus,
Molecular Devices). Microdissections were performed under 40 objectives
using CapSure LCM macro caps. Laser settings ranged from 50 to 80 mW
(power), 1,500 to 2,000 ms (duration), and 15 to 20 Am (diameter). We

performed f500 laser pulses per specimen. To avoid contamination by
adjacent cells, paper Prepar strips (Arcturus) were used before placing LCM
caps to remove tissues that were not well fixed on the sections. The
efficiency of LCM was evaluated by examining the cap after capture, and by
examining the tissue before and after lifting off the cap. The analysis was
done only when frozen biopsy tissues contained clear areas of carcinoma—
evaluated by an experienced pathologist. LCM was performed on 10 sections
from each patient. Due to the technical difficulty in isolating endothelial
cells without contamination from pericytes, we did not pursue studies in
these tumor-associated host cell types. Also, given the limited amount of
RNA collected, we pursued transcriptional studies using quantitative PCR
(qPCR). Based on these results, we validated the qPCR analysis for the
candidate genes with non–amplified RNA.
To determine the potential cellular contamination of the laser-captured
macrophages by surrounding tumor cells, we measured CD68 expression by
reverse transcription-PCR. In cDNA from captured TAMs, CD68 levels were
96-fold higher compared with that in cancer cells, which remained at
background levels after 40 cycles of amplification.
RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the PicoPure RNA
isolation kit (Arcturus) using the protocol of the manufacturer.
Real-time PCR assay. RNA from each sample was used for linear mRNA
amplification to generate the amplified RNA as a template for real-time PCR
assay. Two rounds of linear mRNA amplification were performed using the
RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit (Arcturus). First-strand cDNA synthesis
was done using 100 pg of RNA and the oligo-dT primers. One microgram of
amplified RNA templates from each sample was used to synthesize cDNAs
using TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative
RT-PCR (ABI Prism 7300, Applied Biosystems) was used to determine the
mRNA levels. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of 45 cycles of amplification (annealing/extension: 68jC). The primers were designed using
Primer3 software (Applied Biosystems; Supplementary Table S1). Quality

control studies included assessment of the tRNA integrity by using the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer, elimination of genomic DNA contamination (verified by
DNA-targeted qPCR on DNase-treated RNA), evaluation of the efficiency,
dissociation curve, and sensitivity of the PCR reaction, and verification of the
amplicon size on a 4% Nusieve 3:1 agarose gel (Bio Whittaker).
Immunohistochemistry. Five-micrometer-thick paraffin and frozen
sections were cut and immunostained overnight with antibodies against
SDF1a, CXCR4, and neuropilin 1 (NRP1; Supplementary Note).
Analysis of circulating biomarkers. Peripheral blood biomarker
measurements in these patients have been previously reported (8). Here,
we evaluated the correlation between their levels after treatment and DFS
using Cox proportional hazards model with rank-transformed covariates.
LCM data analysis. We chose relative quantification to determine the
amplification of genes. The change in amplification of genes was
normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
control gene. qPCR data were analyzed by the Relative Quantification Study
in Sequence Detection Software v1.2 (Applied Biosystems). Changes ( fold)
in gene expression level were calculated by the 2DDCt method. In brief, we
used the following formula:
y ¼ 2½x0 x1 ðGAPDH0 GAPDH1 Þ
in which the variables are as follows: x 0, number of PCR cycles at baseline;
x 1, number of PCR cycles at 12 d after bevacizumab treatment; GAPDH0 ,
number of PCR cycles for GAPDH at baseline; and GAPDH1 , number of PCR
cycles for GAPDH at 12 d after bevacizumab treatment. When the limit of
50 PCR cycles was reached for x 0, we placed ‘‘>’’ in front of y, because the
fold difference is greater than y (Tables 1 and 2). When the limit of 50 PCR
cycles was reached for x 1, then we put ‘‘<’’ in front of y, because the fold
difference is lower than y. In several instances ( for example, the expression of

Gene Expression Changes in Tumors after VEGF Blockade

In addition, bevacizumab significantly decreased the expression
of Ang1 and Ang2—key factors in angiogenesis and vascular normalization (12)—in cancer cells and lowered Ang1 in TAMs at day 12
(P < 0.05; Tables 1 and 2). We had previously found by immunohistochemistry that VEGF blockade reduces the expression of Ang2 in
endothelial cells in rectal tumors (13). Other factors analyzed in cancer
cells and TAMs (e.g., bFGF, transforming growth factor-h, IL-8,
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, etc., Tables 1 and
2) showed no significant changes at day 12. Of interest, we found no
change in HIF1a transcription in cancer cells. Future studies
should establish the changes in HIF1a protein level and stability
after VEGF blockade. Thus, we identified molecules that are upregulated in tumors but not in plasma. We propose that the latter are
potential targets to delay the escape from anti-VEGF therapy.
VEGF blockade by bevacizumab treatment induces significant changes in gene expression of cellular receptors in cancer
cells and TAMs. We next examined the gene expression changes of
VEGF receptors in cancer cells. Transcripts of NRP1 and VEGFR2
but not VEGFR1 were detectable in cancer cells. This suggests
the possibility that bevacizumab might directly affect the rectal
cancer cells. NRP1 binds VEGF and modulates VEGFR2 signaling,
and may also independently modulate cell migration and
survival. NRP1 but not VEGFR2 protein expression was
detectable by immunohistochemistry in cancer cells (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). VEGFR2 and NRP1 transcription was
not significantly changed after VEGF blockade in this patient
cohort; however, NRP1 increased in 9 of 12 patients (Table 1). In
addition, we evaluated NRP1 expression in TAMs and found a significant increase at 12 days after bevacizumab (Table 2). Although
the function of NRP1 in TAMs is currently unclear, NRP1 is upregulated in macrophages of the alternatively activated M2
phenotype (14). In the tumor microenvironment, these TAMs may

CXCR4 in cancer cells in patient no. 2; Table 1), the limit of 50 cycles was reached
both at baseline and posttreatment (i.e., CXCR4 was undetectable at both time
points). Changes in the gene expression were analyzed for the patient
cohort using paired exact Wilcoxon test (taking into consideration the
number of patients showing increases/decreases and the extent of change).

Results and Discussion
VEGF blockade by bevacizumab treatment significantly
induces expression of SDF1A and CXCL6 in rectal cancer
cells. For LCM, we identified cancer cells after H&E staining, and TAMs
after CD68 immunostaining (Fig. 1A and B). We detected analyzable
cancer tissue in 12 serial biopsy pairs. TAMs were identified and
collected in sufficient numbers from 8 of these 12 serial biopsy pairs.
Because circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF are significantly elevated
after bevacizumab treatment (8), we first examined the transcription
of these factors in the tumor. Bevacizumab did not consistently upregulate VEGF mRNA expression in the cancer cells or TAMs captured, but surprisingly led to a lower PlGF mRNA expression in
cancer cells (P < 0.001; Tables 1 and 2). Of note, 6 of 12 patients had
substantial increases and 4 of 12 patients had decreases in VEGF
mRNA expression. Next, we measured the changes in expression of
a set of proangiogenic transcription factors, cytokines, and their
receptors, which might facilitate escape from VEGF blockade.
VEGF blockade up-regulated the expression of SDF1a (P < 0.01) as
well as that of granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2/CXCL6, P <
0.05; Table 1; Fig. 1C). Expression of SDF1a protein in cancer cells
was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsy tissues before and after bevacizumab treatment, as well as in lung metastases
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). The SDF1a pathway is known to
modulate angiogenesis independent of VEGF pathway (9), as well as
metastasis in gastrointestinal tumors (10). Similarly, GCP-2/CXCL6 is
expressed in gastrointestinal tumors and promotes angiogenesis (11).

adopt a trophic role that promotes angiogenesis, matrix proteolysis,
and tumor progression (15).
Finally, VEGF blockade by bevacizumab up-regulated the expression of the SDF1a receptor CXCR4 in rectal cancer cells (P < 0.01; Table 1).
Expression of CXCR4 protein in cancer cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsy tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Collectively, these LCM data show that gene expression changes
in rectal carcinomas following bevacizumab treatment are cell
specific and different from changes in circulating cytokines, which
likely emanate primarily from normal tissues (1).
Higher circulating SDF1A levels after VEGF blockade by
bevacizumab are seen in patients with locally advanced rectal
cancer who progress more rapidly to distant metastatic disease.
With a median follow-up of 36 months (4–73 months), none of the
32 patients enrolled in this study experienced local recurrence after
neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (8).
However, 6 of 32 patients did suffer distant failures (lung and/or
liver metastasis) postsurgery. Because SDF1a was detectable in

the plasma in concentrations of >1 ng/mL (Fig. 1D), and is known
to promote cancer cell migration, proliferation, and survival (16), we
explored the possible association between DFS and plasma SDF1a
before, during, and after treatment. The levels of circulating plasma
SDF1a during treatment (at days 12 and 32) were associated with a
more rapid disease progression to metastasis (P < 0.05; Table 3), and
similar trends were seen for plasma SDF1a at 3 days after bevacizumab alone, but not for plasma SDF1a measured at pretreatment
or after neoadjuvant treatment (presurgery; Table 3). Of note, none
of the other plasma circulating biomarkers—previously reported to
correlate with the extent of primary tumor regression in these
patients (i.e., PlGF, VEGF, IL-6, and CEA; ref. 8)—nor the pretreatment tumor and nodal stage were associated with distant
failure postsurgery at 3 years (Table 3).
Implications. The SDF1a-CXCR4 pathway may be a relevant
escape/resistance mechanism when anti-VEGF agents are used in
monotherapy (e.g., in adjuvant therapy or advanced disease;
refs. 2, 17). In this context, we have found that significant increases

in plasma SDF1a after antiangiogenic treatment in patients with
glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with
poor outcomes (4, 5). In this relatively small group of patients, we
found that bevacizumab consistently increased SDF1a as well as
CXCR4 expression in rectal cancer cells, despite the known
heterogeneity of tumors. Moreover, high levels of circulating SDF1a
during neoadjuvant treatment associated with rapid distant disease
progression. Interestingly, SDF1a and CXCR4 expression was
detectable in metastatic cancer cells in the surgical specimens from
liver and lung lesions of patients. Similarly, CXCL6 has been reported
to be up-regulated in colon cancer, and plays a key role in the
induction and maintenance of gut inflammation, enhancing the
development and growth of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (18).
Finally, the increase in NRP1 during bevacizumab treatment might
be relevant because NRP1 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis
in human colorectal carcinomas (19), and NRP1 and VEGF blockade
has been shown to additively inhibit tumor growth (20).
Although antiangiogenesis is a promising and actively employed
cancer therapeutic, mechanistic insight into the molecular
mechanisms underlying tumor resistance and escape from anti-

VEGF therapy is sorely lacking. The identification of SDF1a-CXCR4,
CXCL6, and NRP1 as potential pathways of escape from anti-VEGF
therapy in patients with rectal carcinoma provides the necessary
and critical insight for guiding further therapy.
