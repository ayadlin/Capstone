BACKGROUND: A combination of uracil and ftorafur (UFT) was developed to combine the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with convenient oral dosing. Leucovorin was combined with UFT to further potentiate the effect of 5FU on tumor cells. Orally administered UFT and leucovorin provided higher peak plasma concentrations of 5-FU and
prolonged therapeutic 5-FU concentrations compared with continuous infusion of 5-FU. METHODS: Ninety-one
patients with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes were
treated with UFT and leucovorin, given orally, for the first 28 days of a 35-day cycle. The total daily dose of UFT was
300 mg/m2, administered in 3 doses of 100 mg/m2 each every 8 hours. The primary endpoint was time to disease
progression (TTP). Secondary objectives included overall tumor response rate (overall response equals complete
response plus partial response) and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients enrolled, 70 were evaluable for efficacy. Although no complete responses were observed, 7 patients had partial responses, for an overall response rate
of 10% in the evaluable population. The median TTP for the evaluable population was 10 weeks, and the proportion of
patients who were free of disease progression at 6 months was 23%. The median overall survival was 59.4 weeks for
all patients enrolled. Common, drug-related  grade 3 adverse events (graded according to National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2) included diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: The
combination of UFT and leucovorin administered orally in a 3-times-daily regimen was found to have modest activity.
Grade 3 toxicities were manageable with appropriate dose adjustments in patients with metastatic breast cancer preC 2010 American Cancer Society.

The optimal regimen for treating metastatic breast cancer has not yet been determined. Thus, novel compounds and
various combinations of both investigational and approved therapeutic agents are being tested in clinical studies. Among
the new therapies being explored is an oral combination therapy of uracil and ftorafur (UFT; Taiho Pharmaceutical Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan; BMS-200604, Bristol-Myers Squibb; Princeton, NJ) and leucovorin.
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is frequently used to treat metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer. 5-FU is rapidly
metabolized by the liver. Its mean plasma half-life when given as an intravenous (iv) infusion in humans is 16 minutes.1
Results of a meta-analysis of randomized advanced colorectal cancer clinical studies that compared 5-FU bolus with 5-FU
continuous infusion indicated that continuous infusion was superior in terms of tumor response (14% for bolus vs 22%
for continuous infusion) and median survival time (11.3 months for bolus vs 12.1 months for continuous infusion).2 The
primary side effects observed with 5-FU therapy were gastrointestinal, myelotoxic, or dermatologic (hand-foot

syndrome).3 When 5-FU was administered iv, the most
frequently reported gastrointestinal side effects were oral
mucositis and potentially severe diarrhea.4 Attempts to
reduce side effects while maintaining the antitumor effects
of 5-FU led to the development of ftorafur and, ultimately, of UFT.
Ftorafur (FT), also known as tegafur, is a fluorinated
pyrimidine that has efficacy similar to that of 5-FU.5 Development of an injectable formulation of FT in the
United States was discontinued in the 1980s due to its
neurotoxicity when given at doses of 1 to 3 g. FT was subsequently developed as an oral formulation in Japan,
where it is used as adjuvant therapy for gastrointestinal,
head and neck, breast, and lung cancers. The 5-FU
released when FT is metabolized is itself metabolized by
the same pathway as iv 5-FU, and thus has the same cytotoxic mechanism.
UFT, a combination of uracil and FT in a 4:1 M ratio, was developed in Japan to combine the cytotoxic
effects of 5-FU with the convenience of oral dosing. Uracil is also metabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and competes with 5-FU for the enzyme when
the 2 are co-administered,6 resulting in a significantly prolonged half-life for 5-FU.
Leucovorin (folinic acid), is a tetrahydrofolic acid
derivative that can enhance the therapeutic and toxic
effects of fluoropyrimidines such as 5-FU.1 It is combined
with UFT to further potentiate the effect of 5-FU on tumor cells.
Preclinical studies using combination therapy of
orally administered UFT and leucovorin revealed that
UFT provides higher peak plasma concentrations of 5-FU
and prolonged therapeutic 5-FU concentrations compared with continuous infusion of 5-FU. In addition, the
combination may reduce the toxic effects on normal tissue
seen with the administration of 5-FU or FT alone.
The oral combination therapy of UFT and leucovorin was initially developed in the United States for treating
metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy and safety profiles of the combination have been examined in several
phase 2 and phase 3 studies, which either used UFT and
leucovorin alone or compared the combination with 5FU and leucovorin.7-15 The phase 2 studies focused primarily on response rates and toxicity evaluation in metastatic colorectal cancer. Overall response rates ranged
from 16.9% to 42%. Toxicity was generally less severe
than that noted when 5-FU was used singly or in combination with leucovorin; the absence of hand-foot syndrome was most notable.7-11

The phase 3 studies compared the oral UFT and leucovorin combination with iv 5-FU and leucovorin.13-15 A
dose of 300 mg/m2/day of UFT with 25 to 30 mg of leucovorin 3 times daily (repeated every 35 days), was the
most common regimen for these metastatic colorectal
cancer studies. Results from 1 study indicated that
patients who received the oral combination experienced
less diarrhea and mucositis, with minimal need for dose
interruption or reduction, compared with patients who
received iv 5-FU and leucovorin.13
5-FU has been used with leucovorin as second-line
therapy in treating metastatic breast cancer. FT, with and
without leucovorin, has been explored as an oral, less toxic
alternative to 5-FU. In a phase 2 study of patients with
previously treated metastatic breast cancer, 25 patients
received 750 mg/m2/day of FT with 45 mg/day of leucovorin for 21 days, repeated every 28 days.16 An overall
response rate of 32% was observed, and 48% of patients
experienced disease stabilization (median duration, 6
months). The median time to disease progression (TTP)
was 9 months. The results of this study were striking considering the patients’ advanced conditions and number of
previous chemotherapy regimens. The most common
grade 3 toxicities observed were mucositis (24% of
patients) and diarrhea (12%).
In the current study, UFT was divided into 3 daily
doses, each administered with 30 mg of leucovorin during
the first 28 days of a 35-day cycle. The effectiveness of
combining UFT with leucovorin in a 3 times a day regimen was examined in patients with metastatic breast
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed breast cancer with metastases and had received prior chemotherapy
with anthracyclines and/or taxanes as adjuvant treatment,
neoadjuvant treatment, or as treatment for metastatic disease were eligible. Treatment with at least 1, but not more
than 2, regimens of prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease was required. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status had to be 2. Patients who
demonstrated no evidence of disease progression since
their last treatment regimen were excluded, as were
patients who had received prior treatment with UFT,
capecitabine, ethynyl uracil, or low-dose continuous infusion 5-FU. The patient must have had adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function. Before the initiation of the

1441

Original Article

study, the protocol was approved by an Institutional
Review Board and, for each patient, written informed
consent was obtained and documented by the appropriate
signatures.
Treatment
Patients were given 300 mg/m2/day of UFT, in 3 doses of
100 mg/m2 each, given orally every 8 hours. A 30-mg
dose of leucovorin was given with each dose of UFT.
Patients received study medication for the first 28 days of
each 35-day cycle. If toxicity occurred, the UFT dose was
decreased in increments of 50 mg/m2/day. Once the UFT
dose level was decreased, it was not to be increased. If a
patient required a dose reduction that brought her below
200 mg/m2/day, she was removed from the study.
The dose of leucovorin was not modified unless the
UFT dose was actually withheld, in which case the leucovorin was also withheld. If the UFT dose was withheld due
to toxicity, the patient resumed treatment once the
adverse effects resolved. If the patient did not fulfill retreatment criteria within 2 weeks, she was removed from
the study. For patients remaining in the study, treatment
was continued until disease progression occurred or intolerable toxicities developed.
Note that, if study medication was withheld due to
toxicity, the days it was withheld were counted as treatment days. Therefore, administration of study medication
did not extend beyond Day 28.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was TTP from the on-study date.
Patients who had no disease progression were censored at
their off-study date. Planned secondary endpoints were
overall tumor response rate (OR), overall survival (OS),
and toxicity.
Disease was categorized as measurable, evaluable, or
nonevaluable. Measurable disease response criteria were
defined as follows. A complete response (CR) was defined
as the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions for at
least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of complete
response. A partial response (PR) was defined as a decrease
by >50% in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular dimensions of all measurable lesions, as determined by 2 consecutive observations at least 4 weeks
apart. No lesions, measurable or not, should have progressed, and no new lesions should have appeared. Stable
disease (SD) was considered when there was a failure to
observe remissions as defined above, in the absence of any
progressive or new lesions, as determined by 2 consecutive

1442

observations at least 4 weeks apart. Progressive disease
(PD) was defined as an increase of 25% in the size of
any measurable or evaluable lesion, and/or the appearance
of any new lesions or the occurrence of malignant pleural
effusion or ascites.
Evaluable disease response criteria were defined as
follows. A CR was the complete disappearance of all
known disease for at least 4 weeks. For bone lesions, complete recalcification of lytic lesions or normalization of a
bone scan for blastic lesions. Normalization of tumor
markers, if previously abnormal. A PR was defined as an
estimated decrease in tumor size of 50% for at least 4
weeks. For bone lesions, PR was defined as substantial
recalcification of lytic lesions. SD was used when there
was no significant change in disease status for at least 4
weeks, including unchanged disease, estimated decrease of
<50%, and lesions with estimated increase of <25%.
The appearance of any new lesion not previously identified, or an estimated increase of 25% in existing lesions
was considered as PD. Death secondary to malignant disease was documented as PD.
Response Evaluations
Tumor response was evaluated every 2 cycles, and the
evaluations were continued until disease progression.
Patients who were removed from the study before the first
tumor response assessment were not considered evaluable
for response unless there was clear evidence of clinical disease progression. All suspected responses were documented with a repeat measurement at 4 weeks.
Statistical Analyses
A total of 81 eligible patients were needed to demonstrate
that a 6-month progression-free survival proportion of
30% had a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between
20% and 40%. A total of 90 patients were planned. The
95% CIs were calculated for rates of 6-month progression-free survival and overall response. The Kaplan-Meier
estimator was used to examine overall TTP and OS. Cox
proportional hazards regression models were used to relate
TTP with patient age, ECOG performance status, estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, disease-free
interval, presence of visceral metastases, presence of bone
metastases, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and
prior hormone therapy.

RESULTS
Between April 1999 and September 2001, 91 patients, all
women, were enrolled at 17 sites. The median age of the

patients was 54 years. Of these 91 patients, 2 withdrew
consent before receiving any study medication, leaving 89
patients evaluable for safety. Patient baseline characteristics, including ECOG performance status, prior therapy,
and sites of metastases are summarized in Table 1. Sixtyfive (71.4%) patients received prior hormonal therapy, 57
(62.6%) received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and 86
(94.5%) had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic
breast cancer (55 patients with 1 prior regimen, 30
patients with 2 prior regimens, and 1 patient with 3 prior
regimens). Five patients did not receive prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and were therefore considered
ineligible.
Seventy-two patients (79.1%) had visceral metastases; 58 (63.7%) had bone metastases. Fifty-five patients
(60.4%) had ER-positive tumors, 29 (31.9%) had ERnegative tumors, and 7 (7.7%) had unknown ER status.

The metastatic disease-free interval (calculated from
initial diagnosis to recognition of metastatic disease) was
12 months for 74 patients (81.3%), between 6 and 12
months for 2 patients (2.2%), and <6 months for 15
patients (16.5%).
Two populations were analyzed for efficacy: the eligible population and the efficacy-evaluable population.
The eligible population included all patients who received
at least 1 dose of study medication and was used for the
safety and tolerability analysis. The eligible population
excluded 8 ineligible patients: 5 had received prior adjuvant therapy only and had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, 1 patient continued to receive
tamoxifen after beginning the study, 1 patient’s prestudy
blood chemistries were not obtained, and 1 patient
received pamidronate within 4 months of study initiation
and had bone-only disease. The evaluable population
excluded 7 of the 8 ineligible patients because, although 1
patient was deemed ineligible because prestudy blood
chemistries were not obtained, the patient completed 2
cycles of therapy and received tumor assessment at the end
of cycle 2. In addition, 14 patients were excluded from the
evaluable population because they did not have a tumor
assessment after receiving at least 2 cycles of therapy. Only
the evaluable population will be discussed in this
document.
Summary of Drug Administration
A total of 294 cycles of therapy was administered; the
mean was 3.3 cycles. The average number of treatment
days per cycle was 25, and the average dose administered
per day was 281.25 mg/m2.
Drug administration was summarized separately for
patients with prior bone marrow transplant (8 patients)
and those without (81 patients). For the 8 patients with
prior bone marrow transplant, 20 cycles were administered, with an average of 2.5 cycles (range, 1-5 cycles).
The average number of treatment days per cycle was 25.1,
and the average dose per administration was 294.7 mg/
m2. For the patients without prior bone marrow transplant; 274 cycles were administered, with an average of
3.4 cycles (range, 1-25 cycles). The average number of
treatment days per cycle was 25.5, and the average dose
per administration was 280.28 mg/m2.
Dose Modifications
Dose reductions were required for 18 patients (20.2%),
most frequently for grade 2 or grade 3 diarrhea. Of these
patients, only 1 required a second dose reduction; both

1443

Original Article

reductions were for grade 3 diarrhea. Dose interruptions
due to noncompliance occurred in 10 patients (11.2%).
The reason for dose interruptions in an additional 19
patients (21.3%) was unknown. Four patients (4.5%)
were removed from the study due to toxicity; 2 of these
patients had already undergone dose reduction.
The percentage of patients who experienced dose
modification or interruption has been summarized for all
89 patients who received study therapy. Twenty-five
patients (28.0%) had drug administration interruptions
for a maximum of less than 5 days, 21 patients (24.0%)
had drug administration interruptions for a maximum of
5 to 10 days, and 8 patients (9.0%) had drug administration interruptions for >10 days. Patients with drug
administration interruptions due to toxicity were as follows: 22 patients (25.0%) had drug administration interruptions for a maximum of less than 5 days, 18 patients
(20.0%) had drug administration interruptions for a maximum of 5 to 10 days, and 6 patients (7.0%) had drug
administration interruptions for >10 days.

Efficacy
Table 2 summarizes tumor response for the 70 patients
who were evaluable for efficacy. None of the patients had
a complete response. Seven patients had a partial response,
and the overall response rate (CR þ PR) was 7 patients
(10%) (95% CI, 4.5-19.6). Twenty-five patients (35.7%)
had SD (95% CI, 24.9-48.0), and 38 patients (54.3%)
had PD (95% CI, 42.1-66.1).
The median TTP for the efficacy-evaluable population was 10 weeks (95% CI, 9.5-14.7). The proportion of
patients who were free of disease progression at 6 months
was 23% (95% CI, 13-33). A Cox proportional hazards
regression model was used to relate TTP with ECOG performance status, patient age, ER/PR status, the interval
between diagnosis and on-study, the presence of visceral
metastases, the presence of bone metastases, the number
of prior metastatic chemotherapy regimens (1 or 2), and
prior hormone therapy.
Age and ER/PR status (positive vs negative) were
found to be significant (P<.05) predictors of TTP. The
median TTP for patients aged >65 years was 28.3 weeks,
compared with approximately 10 weeks for those aged
<65 years. The median TTP for patients who were ER/
PR-negative was 5.3 weeks, compared with 10.6 weeks for
patients who were ER and/or PR-positive.
The median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 59.4 weeks (95% CI, 41.1-79.4). The 6-month

survival rate was 77% (95% CI, 68-86), and the 12month survival rate was 53% (95% CI, 42-63).
Safety and Tolerability
All 89 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. The
most commonly reported drug-related adverse events
included nausea (59.6%), diarrhea (53.9%), asthenia
(42.7%), and vomiting (36%).
Side effects were graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 (NCI CTC
v.2). Twenty-eight patients (31.5%) experienced at least 1
adverse event that was grade 3 in severity and was considered related to study medication. The most commonly
reported of these were diarrhea (19.1%), vomiting
(6.7%), abdominal pain (5.6%), nausea (5.6%), and asthenia (4.5%). Diarrhea was the only treatment-related
adverse event that occurred with a grade 3 intensity in
>10% of patients. Severe treatment-related stomatitis was
noted in only 1 patient.
Twelve patients (13.5%) experienced at least 1 grade
3 or greater serious adverse event (SAE) that was considered related to study medication. Study drug related SAEs
included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, intestinal obstruction, abdominal pain, dehydration, stomatitis, and
choreoathetosis.

DISCUSSION
The combination of UFT and leucovorin given orally was
designed to be a potentially less toxic and more convenient alternative therapy to the combination of 5-FU and
leucovorin given by iv infusion. This multicenter phase 2
study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the oral combination given 3 times daily for the first 28 days of a 35-day
cycle in patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer
who had been previously treated with anthracyclines and/
or taxanes.

Oral UFT TID for Advanced Breast Cancer/Hortobagyi et al

Of the 70 patients who were evaluable for efficacy, 7
had partial responses, for an overall response rate of 10%.
The median TTP was approximately 10 weeks; the median overall survival was 59.4 weeks. Approximately 25%
of patients were free of disease progression at 6 months.
The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events
included nausea, diarrhea, asthenia, and vomiting.
Approximately one-third of patients experienced at least 1
grade 3 or higher adverse event.
These findings suggest that the oral combination
therapy of UFT and leucovorin, given in a 3-times-daily
regimen, produces objective responses. Grade 3 toxicities
were manageable with appropriate dose adjustments in
patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated
with anthracyclines and/or taxanes.
