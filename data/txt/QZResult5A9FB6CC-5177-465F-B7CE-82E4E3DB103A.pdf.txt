Abstract
The discovery of a targeted therapeutic compound along with its companion predictive biomarker is a major goal
of clinical development for a personalized anticancer therapy to date. Here we present evidence of the predictive
value of TLR3 expression by tumor cells for the efficacy of Poly (A:U) dsRNA in 194 breast cancer patients enrolled in
a randomized clinical trial. Adjuvant treatment with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was associated with a
significant decrease in the risk of metastatic relapse in TLR3 positive but not in TLR3-negative breast cancers.
Moreover, we show the functional relevance of TLR3 expression by human tumor cells for the antitumor effects
mediated by dsRNA in several preclinical mouse models carried out in immunocompromised animals. These
2 independent lines of evidence relied upon the generation of a novel tool, an anti-TLR3 antibody (40F9.6) validated
for routine detection of TLR3 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues. Altogether, these data suggest that dsRNA
mediates its therapeutic effect through TLR3 expressed on tumor cells, and could therefore represent an
effective targeted treatment in patients with TLR3-positive cancers. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1607–14. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The discovery of a candidate therapeutic target together
with the identification of a highly sensitive population (predictive biomarker) is a major milestone in the development of
new therapeutic agents in oncology. Several successes have
been achieved recently, for instance with antibodies specifically inhibiting Her2/Neu/ERBB2 (1). Clinical benefit is attributable to the capacity of the drug to target a key oncogenic
pathway aberrantly activated in tumor cells. Whether other
molecules not specifically overexpressed by tumor cells could
become drugable targets remained an open question. Here we
show an example of this kind in which a drug [the double-

stranded RNA (dsRNA) Poly (A:U)] can target its receptor TLR3
expressed on tumor cells leading to tumor regression in vivo.
Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize pathogen-associated
molecular patterns and are essential to generate potent antimicrobial proinflammatory immune responses. TLR3 is activated by viral or synthetic dsRNA (2). Such as Poly (A:U)
sequences. Although initially described as specifically
expressed by dendritic cells (3), TLR3 has recently been
reported to be expressed by a broad array of epithelial cells
including pulmonary cells (4) and hepatocytes (5). Interestingly, tumor cells such as breast cancers (6) or melanoma (7)
can also express TLR3, which triggering may lead to apoptosis
and/or to chemoattraction of cytotoxic lymphocytes to tumor
beds (6–9). Six randomized trials carried out between 1970
and 1990 have evaluated the efficacy of dsRNA in oncology
(10–15). Administration of dsRNA was associated with a
significant clinical benefit in 2 trials (10, 11) and with a trend
for a more favorable outcome in 3 other trials (12, 14, 15). This
reproducible effect in small number of patients suggested that
dsRNA could be highly effective in a subset of individuals that
remained to be determined. The identification of TLR3 as one
molecular target of dsRNA, together with the description of
TLR3 expression by cancer cells, led us to hypothesize that
TLR3 expressed by tumor cells could predict high sensitivity to
dsRNA.
The current results show both the predictive value of
immunoreactive TLR3 expression by tumor cells for the
efficacy of dsRNA treatment in breast cancer patients, and
the functional relevance of TLR3 expression by cancer cells for
the antitumor effects mediated by dsRNA. Altogether, these

versitaire Vaudois according to local ethics protocols with
patients’ informed consent. Melanoma tissue microarrays
were purchased from US Biomax (TMA ME#802 and
ME#241) and Tristar (TMA #69571049).

Materials and Methods
Generation of the 40F9.6 monoclonal antibody
BALB/c mice were immunized with a recombinant human
His-tagged TLR3 extracellular domain recombinant protein
(R&D systems). Mice received 1 primo-immunization with an
emulsion of TLR3 protein and Complete Freund Adjuvant,
intraperitoneally, a second immunization with an emulsion of
TLR3 protein and Incomplete Freund Adjuvant, intraperitoneally, and 3 boosts with TLR3 protein, intravenously. Immune
spleen cells were fused with X63.Ag8.653 immortalized B cells,
and cultured in the presence of irradiated spleen cells. Hybridoma were evaluated in a first screen for TLR3 binding using
an ELISA developed for detection of binding to His-tagged
recombinant TLR3 protein (R&D systems). Supernatants were
screened in an immunohistochemistry screen for binding to
293T-TLR3 cells as a paraffin-embedded cell pellet, with no
binding to 293T-TLR4 cells. Hybridomas selected from the
initial screening were cloned by limiting dilution techniques in
96-well plates, and subclones were tested in TLR3 ELISA and
IHC for binding to 293T-TLR3 cells as a paraffin-embedded
cell pellet.
Clinical trial and tumor samples
Primary tumors were obtained from 194 breast cancer
patients included in a randomized trial. For trial inclusion,
patients were selected to present operable T2/T3 breast
cancer with involved axillary node, treated by mastectomy
plus axillary dissection. Women were randomly assigned to
receive either polyadenylic–polyuridylic acid (60 mg i.v. once a
week for 6 weeks) plus postoperative locoregional irradiation
with pelvic irradiation in premenopausal women or CMF
(cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 orally on days 1–14; methothrexate 40 mg/m2 i.v. and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 i.v. on
days 1 and 8) for 6 monthly cycles. Overall 517 patients were
included between 1982 and 1986 in this multicentric trial.
Among these 517 patients, 197 were recruited at the Institut
Gustave Roussy. Results of the trial have been reported previously (14, 16). TLR3 immunostaining (clone 40F9.6) was
done on 194 paraffin-embedded tumor samples retrieved in
Institut Gustave Roussy's tumor bank.
TLR3 immunohistochemistry
After antigen retrieval in hot TRIS-EDTA-citrate buffer pH
7.8 and blocking of endogenous peroxidases with 3% H2O2 ,
sections were stained with 40F9.6 antibody (10 mg/mL) for 1
hour. Staining was detected with Envision kit (DAKO) and
Impact DAB Kit from Vector Laboratories. TLR3 staining was
assessed by 2 independent investigators who were blinded to
clinical characteristics and were not from similar institutions.
TLR3 staining was considered positive if greater than 1%
tumor cells were positive. TLR3 staining was done also on
melanoma sections from patients of Centre Hospitalier Uni-

Mice, cell lines, and reagents
Animal experiments were carried out in agreement with
local ethical guidelines. Rag2 /- common gamma chain /
(Rag2 / g c/) immunodeficient mice were obtained from
Harlan and severe combined immunodeficiency-nonobese
diabetic (SCID-NOD) immunodeficient mice were obtained
from Charles River.
A 293T cell line (ATCC, #CRL-1573) was stably transfected
with pUNO-hTLR3 plasmid or pUNO-hTLR4 plasmid (InVivogen) and referred to respectively as 293T-TLR3 and 293TTLR4. The human cell lines A375 (melanoma) and HCC1806
(breast adenocarcinoma) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, and stably transduced with lentiviruses expressing GFP, puromycin resistance gene, and
shRNA specific for either control Lamin, (shLaminA/C,
GAAGGAGGGTGACCTGATATTCAAGAGATATCAGGTCACCCTCCTTC), hTRIF(shTRIF,AAGACCAGACGCCACTCCAACTCAAGAGGTTGGAGTGGCGTCTGGTCTT) produced at
Vectalys. Transduced cells were grown in the presence of
puromycin, and tested for GFP expression to confirm the
presence of the lentiviral vector. A375 cells were treated for
24 hours in vitro with 1000 U/mL of IFNa2b (Introna, purchased
from Schering Plough). Me 260 cells and lentiviruses expressing
control siRNA (specific to Lamin A/C; siLAmin) or siRNA
specific to human TLR3 (siTLR3) were already described (7).
Poly (I:C) dsRNA was purchased from InvivoGen. The latter
were regularly checked in agarose gels for integrity and care
was taken to prevent degradation due to shearing forces. Poly
(A:U) dsRNA used in in vitro studies on human tumor cell lines
and in vivo in SCID-NOD mice, was synthetized by Innate
Pharma, and has been previously described (8).
Human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice
Human tumor cell suspensions freshly harvested from in
vitro passaged tumor cell lines were injected s.c. in the flank
(5.10^6 cells per mouse for Me 260, 3.10^6 for A375, and
HCC1806). The treatment was started 1 week postengraftment,
and consisted of either weekly i.v. injections with human
IFNa2b (105 IU/mouse in 200 mL PBS) followed by Poly (I:C;
100 mg) 24 hours later for Me 260 cells, or daily injection of 200
mg (A375) or 500 mg (HCC1806) Poly (A:U), 5 times per week.
Tumor growth was monitored weekly or biweekly with an
electronic caliper, and expressed as volume (mm3).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were done using the nonparametric, 2tailed Mann–Whitney test. Both metastases and death, but
not locoregional relapses, were considered as events. To
evaluate dsRNA effect according to TLR3 expression in breast
cancer patients, a multivariate Cox model was used. HR and
95% CIs are reported. Cox model was adjusted on prognostic
variables (age and number of axillary nodes involved). Survival
curves report the estimated probability of being free of

Results
Generation of a novel tool to detect TLR3 protein in
paraffin-embedded tissues
To study TLR3 expression in human paraffin-embedded
tissues, commercially available anti-TLR3 antibodies were
tested, and none of them could specifically label paraffinembedded pellets of 293T transfected with human TLR3
(293T-TLR3). We therefore generated new mAbs, including
an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAB; clone 40F9.6) that specifically labeled 293T-TLR3 cells, but not control parental cells,
nor 293T cells transfected with human TLR4 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). This mAb strongly stained IFNa2b-treated A375
melanoma cells embedded in paraffin, whereas no detectable
labeling could be observed of IFNa2b-treated A375 cells stably
expressing a short hairpin RNA specific for human TLR3,
further showing that 40F9.6 specifically recognizes human
TLR3 expressed at physiological levels (Supplementary

Fig. S1). Finally, 40F9.6 recognized recombinant human
TLR3 extracellular domain in western blot experiments (data
not shown).
TLR3 expression on tumor cells defines a subset of
cancer patients highly sensitive to dsRNA
Immunohistochemistry with this mAb on tissue microarrays or paraffin-embedded tumor sections showed TLR3
expression by 50% of the melanoma tested (n ¼ 99) and by
36% to 45% breast cancers in a cohort of 194 patients (Fig. 1A,
Table 1, and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, this
proportion of TLR3-expressing melanoma was similar to that
observed in patient-derived melanoma cell lines by immunoprecipitation (7). We retrospectively assessed whether TLR3
expression could be a predictive marker of clinical response to
systemic delivery of the TLR3 agonist Poly (A:U). We correlated TLR3 expression on primary breast tumors (determined
by 2 independent investigators on immunostainings with
40F9.6) with the onset of metastastic relapse in a cohort of
194 breast cancer patients. These patients were included
at the Institut Gustave Roussy in a multicentric randomized
trial that compared Poly (A:U) treatment combined with
radiation therapy to adjuvant chemotherapy (14; patients
characteristics in Table 1). A TLR3-specific immunostaining

of breast cancers, without significant correlation with any

In a multivariate Cox analysis, adjuvant treatment with

TLR3-negative cancer [15-year metastasis-free survival: 56%
(37–71%) vs. 42% (27–56%), P ¼ 0.22]. At the opposite, when
the analyses focused on patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, a trend was observed toward a worse prognosis in
patients who presented a TLR3-positive breast cancer as
compared with TLR3-negative (P ¼ 0.21 and 0.09 for investigators A and B respectively).
Altogether, these data, consistent between 2 different investigators, suggested that immunostaining of TLR3 on tumor
cells could be a reliable approach to identify a subset of
patients who are sensitive to dsRNA treatment. These data
give rise to the hypothesis that dsRNA could mediate its
antitumor effects through TLR3 expressed by cancer cells.
TLR3 expression by tumors dictates the antitumor
efficacy mediated by dsRNAs in vitro and in
immunodeficient mice
Based on these clinical data, we evaluated in vitro and in
preclinical animal models whether the antitumor effect of
dsRNA is mediated by TLR3 expressed by tumor cells. Both
the melanoma cell line A375 and the breast cancer cell line
HCC1806 underwent TRIF-dependent (i.e., TLR3 dependent)
cell death after in vitro exposure to dsRNAs (Figs. 2A, 2C).
Subcutaneuous growth of both cell lines were severely impaired
by intravenous injections of Poly (A:U) in NOD/SCID mice
(Figs. 2B and 2D), suggesting that therapeutic effect is not

related to TLR3 expressed by immune cells. Altogether, these
preclinical data, combined with biomarker data, suggest that
dsRNA could mediate its antitumor effect via TLR3 expressed on
tumor cells, and could be effective in TLR3-overexpressing
cancers.
Type I interferon is known to increase TLR3 expression, and
IFNa2b pretreatment is mandatory to observe dsRNAinduced TLR3-dependent apoptosis in vitro in the melanoma
cells Me 260 (7). In vivo, the combination of both immunomodulatory agents was synergistic to hamper tumor progression (Fig. 3A) and to enhance TLR3 expression on tumors
(Fig. 3B) in Rag2/ g c/immunodeficient mice (lacking B, T,
and NK cells; ref. 17). To formally show that the synergistic
therapeutic effect was TLR3-dependent (and therefore tumor
cell autonomous), Me 260 cells were transduced with lentiviruses recombinant for a siRNA targeting human TLR3
(siTLR3) or human lamin as a control (siLamin). SiTLR3
Me 260 cells exhibited markedly reduced TLR3 expression
and were resistant to IFNa2b plus Poly (I:C) combined treatment in vitro, by contrast to parental and siLamin control cells
(Fig. 3C; ref. 7). Similar observations were made on single cell
isolates from in vivo grown tumors originating from siLamin
or siTLR3 cells (Fig. 3C), showing the overtime stability in vivo
of siRNA-mediated TLR3 inhibition. Consistent with our
in vitro observations, the efficacy of the combination therapy
in immunodeficient mice was significantly reduced against

Altogether, these data support the finding that TLR3 expression by the tumor cell itself is mandatory for an optimal
success of dsRNAs in vivo, and suggest that dsRNA mediates
its antitumor effects mainly via tumor-expressed TLR3.

IPH3102 (Innate Pharma). As mentioned previously, earlier
trials done in this field have emphasized the need for predictive biomarkers to identify highly sensitive population. In
this study, we have reported that the subset of patients
presenting a TLR3-overexpressing breast cancer derived high
benefit from adjuvant dsRNA treatment. Importantly, the tool
developed to quantify TLR3 expression (mAb clone 40F9.6)
meets the criteria for a clinical use. Indeed, it specifically binds
to TLR3, and the rate of discrepancies between readers is
within acceptable range (18%) and comparable with what

Cancer Therapy with TLR3 Agonists

is observed with estrogen receptor or Her2 (18). Several
methodological points deserve further discussion. First, the
clinical trial presented an imbalance in the use of radiation
therapy across the 2 arms. To limit this bias, we have used
incidence of metastases as study endpoint. Indeed, although
radiation therapy dramatically improves locoregional control,
there is no evidence that such modality of treatment could
decrease incidence of metastases when compared with chemotherapy in patients treated with radical mastectomy (19).
Second, although dsRNA improves outcome in TLR3-positive
breast cancer, the prognosis was not significantly different
between TLR3-positive and TLR3-negative breast cancer treated with dsRNA. The lack of 15-year survival difference
between TLR3-positive and TLR3-negative patients treated
with Poly (A:U) could be explained by an adverse prognostic
value for TLR3 expression in patients not treated with the
targeted agent. This phenomenon has been well described in
the field of new targeted therapies. For instance, due to the
adverse prognostic value of Her2-overexpression in untreated
patients, patients with Her2-overexpressing breast cancer
treated with trastuzumab have similar survival as the ones
with Her2-negative breast cancers, although trastuzumab is
providing dramatic outcome improvement in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer (20). Finally, although this study suggests that dsRNAs are mediating an antitumor activity via
TLR3 expressed by cancer cells, we cannot exclude a role for
the immune cells in TLR3-negative cancers. Indeed, the sample size is too small to exclude a small efficacy of dsRNA in
TLR3-negative breast cancers.
Importantly, this clinical correlation was strongly supported
by several xenograft models in immunodeficient mice showing
a significant antitumor effect of TLR3 agonists that was totally
independent of a fully functional immune system, but dependent on TLR3 expressed by tumor cells. Indeed, reduction of
TLR3 expression by tumors using siRNA compromised dsRNAs
efficacy, whereas its augmentation with human IFNa2b, which
acts only on human cells, enhanced it. Along these lines, we
could show direct targeting of dsRNA to TLR3 expressed by
tumor cells in vivo as human IL-6 could be detected in the
serum of dsRNA-treated mice bearing TLR3 positive, but not
TLR3 negative, tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This study suggests that TLR3-mediated apoptosis could
be the mechanism of the therapeutic effect mediated by

dsRNA. Additional mechanisms of action could also
contribute to the antitumor efficacy of such products in
immunocompetent tumor-bearing individuals. First, TLR3
agonists are well-known immune adjuvants that promote
antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells and enhance
antigen-specific CD8þ T cell responses (21–25). Moreover,
we have previously shown in syngeneic mouse tumor models
that Poly (A:U) can elicit the release of chemokines by TLR3expressing tumor cells, and thereby modulate the tumor
microenvironment and synergize with immunogenic chemotherapy and tumor vaccines (8). In addition, our unpublished data indicates that host IFN I receptor was required
for an optimal therapeutic efficacy of Poly (A:U) against
established TLR3-expressing tumors. Indeed, IFN I is needed
for full DC maturation in response to dsRNA (26, 27) and it
may also enhance the sensitivity of TLR3-expressing tumors
to the drug (dsRNA).
In summary, this study strongly supports the clinical development of novel generations of TLR3-specific agonists. New
prospective phase I/II clinical trials with these compounds
should further validate TLR3 as a predictive biomarker for
their therapeutic efficacy and document the potential additive
role of IFN I receptor. These trials might be best implemented
in cancer types that express high levels and frequency of TLR3,
including advanced melanoma as shown here, but also in lung,
cervical, or oesophagus cancers (our unpublished observations), renal cell carcinoma (28), hepatocellular carcinoma (29,
30), prostate cancer (31), or head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (32).
