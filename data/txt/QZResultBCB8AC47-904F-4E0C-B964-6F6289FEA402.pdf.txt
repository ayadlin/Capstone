Abstract

Author Manuscript

Current theories suggest that mitotic checkpoint proteins are essential for proper cellular response
to taxanes, a widely-used family of chemotherapeutic compounds. We recently demonstrated that
absence or depletion of protein Daxx increases cellular taxol (paclitaxel) resistance—a common
trait of patients diagnosed with several malignancies, including breast cancer. Further
investigation of Daxx-mediated taxol response revealed that Daxx is important for the proper
timing of mitosis progression and cyclin B stability. Daxx interacts with mitotic checkpoint
protein Rassf1 and partially co-localizes with this protein during mitosis. Rassf1/Daxx depletion
or expression of Daxx binding domain of Rassf1 elevates cyclin B stability and increases taxol
resistance in cells and mouse xenograft models. In breast cancer patients, we observed the inverse
correlation between Daxx and clinical response to taxane-based chemotherapy. These data suggest
that Daxx and Rassf1 define a mitotic stress checkpoint that enables cells to exit mitosis as
micronucleated cells (and eventually die) when encountered with specific mitotic stress stimuli,
including taxol. Surprisingly, depletion of Daxx or Rassf1 does not change activity of E3 ubiquitin
ligase APC/C in in vitro settings, suggesting necessity of mitotic cellular environment for proper
activation of this checkpoint. Daxx and Rassf1 may become useful predictive markers for the
proper selection of patients for taxane chemotherapy.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle checkpoints are necessary controls that halt cell cycle progression in response to
stresses that may otherwise promote genome instability. Under physiological conditions, the
spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that during mitosis all kinetochores are stably
attached to microtubules before separation of chromosomes during anaphase. Spindle toxins
such as taxanes (taxol/paclitaxel and docetaxel/taxotere), nocodazole, and others promote
conditions of prolonged mitotic stress by binding tubulin heterodimers and interrupting the
polymerization/depolymerization rate of microtubules; they are widely used as cell biology
tools and as chemotherapeutic agents. Paclitaxel (taxol) is one of the most common
chemotherapeutic agents used to treat human cancers (reviewed in (O'Shaughnessy, 2005)).
However, many cancer patients are resistant or become resistant to taxol during drug
administration (Crown et al., 2004); (Ravdin et al., 2003); (Bonneterre et al., 1999).
Overcoming resistance or incomplete response to these agents would represent a major
advantage in the clinical treatment of breast cancer (Henderson et al., 2003); (Aapro, 2001).

Block of microtubule dynamics can result in the potential alteration of mitotic processes,
including separation of centrosomes, microtubule attachment to kinetochores (and activation
of the SAC) and proper alignment and separation of chromosomes. When cells are exposed
to conditions of prolonged mitotic stress in the presence of these toxins, the SAC is
eventually inactivated and cells can exit mitosis as micro-nucleated and tetraploid (Mantel et
al., 2008); (Wysong et al., 2009). This mitotic exit is primarily dependent upon the
ubiquitination and proteolysis of cyclin B and Securin, a process referred to as “mitotic
slippage”, or “mitotic catastrophe” (Brito and Rieder, 2006). The proteins and pathways that
govern this slippage during prolonged stress conditions, however, are insufficiently
characterized. Cells that lack key SAC-related proteins like Mad2 and BubR1, experience
enhanced sensitivity to spindle toxins with increased occurrence of micro-nucleated cells
(Lee et al., 2004); (Sudo et al., 2004); (Niikura et al., 2007). However, very few instances of
enhanced mitotic arrest or “resistance” are ascribed to proteins in response to spindle toxins.
To date, only few examples are known when inactivation of mitotic checkpoint proteins
leads to reduced sensitivity to taxanes, including BRCA1 (Chabalier et al., 2006) and Mad2
antagonist protein p31comet (Xia et al., 2004). Recently, we reported that the nuclear protein
Daxx is involved in taxane sensitivity (Lindsay et al., 2007). Daxx is a highly conserved and
developmentally essential nuclear protein (Ishov et al., 2004; Lindsay et al., 2009;
Michaelson et al., 1999a). Daxx is involved in numerous cellular processes such as
transcriptional regulation (Lindsay et al., 2008), anti-viral immunity (Saffert and Kalejta,
2008), apoptosis (Michaelson, 2000; Salomoni and Khelifi, 2006) and carcinogenesis. We
previously showed that, upon taxol treatment, cells with reduced level of Daxx remain in a
prolonged mitotic arrest and complete cell division after taxol removal, while wild-type cells
exit from taxol-induced mitotic block as micro-nucleated cells incapable for proliferation
(Lindsay et al., 2007). Thus, Daxx-deficient cancer cells that are exposed to taxol can
survive treatment, but the mechanism remains elusive.
Taxanes affect microtubule stability, but mutations or alterations in tubulin occur very rarely
in cancers (Hari et al., 2003a). Functional screens have been directed at finding novel targets
affecting sensitivity to taxol and other compounds but it remains unclear whether these

targets play a direct role in taxol sensitization or offer prognostic value to clinicians
(Swanton et al., 2007). The existence of a mitotic stress checkpoint(s), separate in function
from the SAC has been proposed in regard to cells that have been exposed to spindle toxins
(Scolnick and Halazonetis, 2000) and guardian proteins or pathways may be in place at
particular stages of mitosis where these drugs may target important mitotic functions. Thus,
it is essential to identify the proteins and pathways involved in taxol sensitization/resistance
because foreknowledge of these targets may prove useful for proper selection of patients for
taxane-based chemotherapy. To this end, we sought to further understand the phenomenon
of Daxx-dependent taxol resistance related to mitosis and to determine its importance in
tumors subjected to this chemotherapy. Here, we describe the cell cycle dependent
interaction of Daxx with protein Rassf1 in establishing the proper cellular response to taxol.

Materials and Methods
Author Manuscript

Biochemical Fractionation
HEp2 cells were separated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions using a biochemical
fractionation method described in (Lindsay et al., 2009).
Cell Culture
HEp2 cells and primary MEFs (Ishov et al., 2004) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL) and grown in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator. Taxol (Paclitaxel; Sigma; 100 µM in DMSO) was used at a final
concentration of 10 nM. Thymidine (Sigma) was dissolved in 1N NaOH for 1M stock and
used at a final concentration of 2 mM.

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle synchronization
HEp2 cells were synchronized using a double thymidine block protocol as described in
(Lindsay et al., 2007). For taxol studies, 10 nM taxol was added six hours after release of
cells from second thymidine block; at this time point, up to 95% of cells were accumulated
in G2 phase by FACS analysis.
Colony Formation Assay
Cells exposed to control or 10 nM taxol were originally plated on 3.5 cm dishes (Corning)
for treatment. Following exposure, cells were trypsinized and re-plated (in triplicates) at
1:1000 dilution on six well plates (Costar) for colony formation analysis. Five to seven days
afterwards, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted.

Immunofluoresence
Immunofluoresence analysis was completed on cells grown overnight on cover slips in 24
well plates (Costar). Briefly, cells were fixed using 1% formaldehyde or ice-cold methanol
(for analysis of microtubules). Following fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.4%
Triton X-100 (formaldehyde fixed cells only). Cells were incubated for 1 h with the
following primary antibodies: Daxx rabbit (Santa Cruz), Daxx 5.14 monoclonal (Ishov et

al., 2004), PML 14 rabbit (Ishov et al., 1999), Rassf1C mouse polyclonal (UT
Southwestern), Rassf1 rabbit (gift from Dr. Dae Sik Lim, Korea Advanced Institute for
Science and Technology), and alpha-Tubulin (Sigma). Cells were washed in PBS and
incubated with appropriate FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector
Labs; all diluted 1:300), stained with HOECHST 33342 (Sigma) for DNA visualization and
mounted on slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech). Images were analyzed using
Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.
Immunohistochemistry

For this study, twenty two women were identified with locally advanced HER-2 nonamplified breast cancer who were treated with standard taxane/anthracycline based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Initial core biopsy was
performed for the diagnosis and all patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
by definitive surgery with either lumpectomy or mastectomy and axillary lymph node
dissection. Two patients had invasive lobular carcinoma, one patient papillary carcinoma,
while the remainder had invasive ductal carcinoma. Four tumors were hormone receptor
negative and eighteen tumors were hormone receptor positive. Tissue blocks were obtained
from initial biopsy (prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to perform immunohistochemical
staining for Daxx. Slides were de-paraffinized with xylene and re-hydrated through
decreasing concentrations of ethanol to water, including an intermediary step to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity (3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol). For heat-induced
antigen retrieval, sections were heated in a water bath at 95°C while submerged in Trilogy
buffer (Cell Marque, Hot Springs, AR) for 25 minutes and afterwards incubated with a
universal protein blocker Sniper (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) for 15 min, RT.
Monoclonal mouse anti-Daxx 5.14 was added o/n at RT. Mach 2 goat anti-mouse-horse
radish peroxidase-conjugated (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) was then added for 30
min, RT. Detection of Daxx was achieved by incubating slides in 3’3’ diaminobenzidine
(Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) for 15 min, RT. Slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 10 sec and mounted with
Cytoseal XYL (Richard-Allen Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Slides were analyzed using Leica
DM2000 microscope and pictures were taken using Leica DFC480 CCD camera with Leica
FireCam 1.7.1 software. For each specimen, at least one thousand cells were examined for
Daxx expression, and the number of cells with an evident signal were recorded and
categorized by the intensity of staining (0 for undetectable, 5 for highest) of Daxx multiplied
by the percent of staining cells (Daxx score).
Time lapse microscopy

Author Manuscript

Time lapse imaging of cells was performed according to (Meraldi et al., 2004). Briefly,
control and Daxx-depleted HEp2 cells were stably transfected with GFP-histone H2B (gift
of Dr. Duane Compton, Dartmouth) and analyzed by Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope
equipped with environmental chamber; images were taken every 2 min. Mitotic stages were
determined by three hallmark events including 1) first indication of chromatin condensation
marked as late G2/prophase transition (T=0); 2) invagination of the nucleus marking the
prophase/pro-metaphase transition; and 3) beginning of chromosome segregation marking

the metaphase/anaphase transition. Three experiments were completed for each shRNA
group with an average of 20–30 cells per experiment.
Yeast two-hybrid screen
mDaxx wt was cloned in pGBDC1-Trp1 and transformed in PJ69-4A MATa and tested for
self-activation. Screening for Daxx interaction partners was done using pre-transformedi
(Y187 yeast strain, MATa) cDNA library from 11 E embryos (library in pACT2 Leu2,
Clontech # MY4012AH). Sequence analysis of two strong interaction clones from –HisLeu-Trp plates revealed homology with amino acids 5-270 and 30-270 of mouse RAS
associated domain family 1 splice form C (Rassf1C). Retransformation and betta-gal assay
confirmed the specificity of this interaction in yeast.
In vitro pull down assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Daxx constructs were cloned into pGEX-2T or pGEX-4T3 (Invitrogen). Rassf1 contruct
were generated in pQE-30 (Qiagen) or pMAL-c2x vectors (New England BioLabs).
Constructs were then transformed into a Rosetta strain of E. coli. Protein expression was
induced using 50 µM IPTG (Fisher) (pGEX-4T3 constructs), 0.1 mM IPTG (pQE-30
constructs) or 0.3 mM IPTG (pMAL constructs) at room temperature for 3 hrs (pGEX and
pMAL) or 18° C overnight (pQE-30). Cells were lysed using buffer consisting of 0.1%
Triton X-100, 200 µM phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Calbiochem), 1 µg/mL
aprotinin (Sigma), 1 µM leupeptin (Sigma), 1 µM pepstatin (Sigma) and 10 mM 2–
mercapto-ethanol (Sigma) in TBS. A GST- and 6X-His pull-down kit (Pierce
Biotechnology) was then used to determine binding capability as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) and derivative fusion proteins were purified
following instructions for pMAL™ protein fusion and purification system (New England
BioLabs). Protein samples were analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Biorad).
Mouse Xenografts

Author Manuscript

HEp2 xenografts were generated in Nu/Nu mice by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 HEp2
cells containing a 1:1 mixture of matrigel (BD Bioscience)/DMEM suspension. Tumors
were monitored daily and grown to a volume of approximately 150 mm3 (day 7–9 after cell
injection) before drug treatment. Vehicle (1 part of 1:1 solution of 50% EtOH/Cremaphor
EL (Sigma) to 10 parts of PBS) or 20 mg/kg taxol (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA;
Paclitaxel stock = 25 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH/Cremaphor EL) was injected
intraperitonealy (IP) every second day for a total of five injections. Up to fifteen animals
were used for each experimental group. Tumor volume was measured by calipers and
calculated on a daily basis using the formula V= (1/6) πa(b)2 where (a) and (b) are the
measured length and width (millimeters) of the tumor, respectively. Increases or reductions
in tumor size were determined according to the relative initial tumor size beginning on day
one of injection. Experiment was terminated at day 15 of first drug injection or when tumor
volume reaches 1000 mm3.

HEp2 cells were transduced with recombinant lentivirus supernatants encoding hairpin
siRNA for hDaxx, hRassf1A and control expression constructs in the presence of 4 ug/ml
polybrene. The lentiviral expression system was provided by Peter M. Chumakov (Lerner
Research Institute, Cleveland (Sablina et al., 2005). This lentiviral system comprises a
targeting envelope expression vector pCMV-VSV-G, a generic packaging expression vector
pCMV-deltaR8.2 and the expression cassette for custom siRNA pLSL-GFP that contains a
minimal histone H4 promoter that drives transcription of a GFP gene allowing fluorescent
cell sorting. Candidate siRNAs for Daxx and Rassf1A were designed according to the
Dharmacon siDESIGN algorithm (http://www.dharmacon.com/sidesign/). Anti-Daxx siRNA

Results
Duration of Mitotic Stages are Affected in the Absence of Daxx

Author Manuscript

Resistance to taxol was observed in human breast cancer and human larynx carcinoma HEp2
cells with experimentally reduced Daxx (Lindsay et al., 2007). To understand the function
of Daxx in taxol response we utilized HEp2 cells expressing control or anti-Daxx shRNAs
(Fig. 1A). We used this model cell line since taxane-based therapy is one of treatment
options in head and neck cancer (De Mulder, 1999) and given the ability of HEp2 cells to
recapitulate the Daxx-dependent taxol response observed in breast cancer cell lines as
previously shown (Lindsay et al., 2007). HEp2 cells were synchronized using a double
thymidine block and released for cyclin B protein level analysis to monitor G2/M/G1
progression. While control-shRNA cells showed destruction of cyclin B by 9 hrs postthymidine release, Daxx-depleted cells showed prolonged stabilization of cyclin B at 9.5–11
hrs post-release, suggesting Daxx is required for normal mitosis progression (Figure 1B).
Next, we studied mitotic progression by time-lapse microscopy in control- and Daxxdepleted cells stably transfected with histone H2B-GFP; results are summarized in Table 1.
The occurrence of chromatin condensation in Daxx-depleted cells was more rapid,
indicating faster progression of prophase compared to control cells (Daxx shRNA cells has
average 7.5 min, control shRNA average 10.2 min). Contrary, the average prometaphase/
metaphase timing of Daxx-depleted cells (37.6 min) was longer than in control-depleted
cells (average 31.2 min). No differences in mitotic progression were observed in control
shRNA compared to parental HEp2 cells (data not shown). The combination of these data
suggests that depletion of Daxx in human cells results in perturbation of normal mitosis
implying that Daxx is necessary for proper mitotic progression.

Author Manuscript

During interphase, Daxx is a predominately nuclear protein (Lindsay et al., 2009)
accumulating at ND10/PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) (Ishov et al., 1999), while
conversely, taxol sensitivity is mostly affected by mitotic-related proteins; thus, we
analyzing Daxx distribution throughout the cell cycle by immunofluorescent staining. We
found Daxx to localize predominately in nuclei at PML NBs during interphase in MEFs
(Fig. S1, upper cells in both rows); however, the distribution of Daxx at PML NBs began to
change during early pro-metaphase, when the majority of Daxx is still associated with PML
NBs, and also begins to localize at spindle-like pattern (Fig S1, upper row). By late prometaphase, the majority of Daxx is absent from PML NBs, but remains at a spindle-like
pattern (Fig S1, bottom row).
Cell Cycle-Dependent Localization of Daxx and Rassf1

Author Manuscript

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting partners that could determine
Daxx-mediated mitosis progression and taxol sensitivity. Two clones corresponding to RAS
associated domain family 1 splice form C (Rassf1C) were identified using this method,
which mapped to aa 5–270 and aa 30–270 of the mouse Rassf1C polypeptide (Fig. S2). Retransformation and beta-gal assay confirmed interaction of Daxx and Rassf1C clones in
yeast (data not shown). Rassf1C and Rassf1A are two major isoforms of tumor suppressor
protein Rassf1; Rassf1A has been extensively studied in regard of cell cycle progression,

mitosis and apoptosis (reviewed in (Agathanggelou et al., 2005), while Rassf1C biology is
much less understood. Previous reports addressed the interaction and function of Daxx and
Rassf1. The first study described Rassf1C as a nuclear protein with Daxx-dependent
accumulation at PML NBs during interphase (Kitagawa et al., 2006). Upon degradation of
Daxx, the authors found Rassf1C to translocate into the cytoplasm where it localized to
microtubules. The other report suggests that Daxx interacts with Rassf1A, although the
dynamic of localization is much less understood (Song et al., 2008). We found that
endogenous Rassf1A and Rassf1C are strictly cytoplasmic, while endogenous Daxx is a
nuclear protein associated mostly with PML NBs (Fig. 2A). In addition, the depletion of
Daxx did not affect the distribution of Rassf1C/A as was previously reported in (Kitagawa et
al., 2006): it has same cytoplasmic distribution upon Daxx depletion (Fig. 2A, bottom row)
as in control shRNA expressing cells (Fig. 2A, top row). Biochemical fractionation of HEp2
cells into nuclear and cytosolic fractions confirmed that endogenous Rassf1 was strictly
segregated into tubulin-containing (cytosolic) fractions, while endogenous Daxx was
predominately associated with HP1-alpha containing nuclear fractions (Fig. 2B) supporting
previous data showing predominately nuclear association of Daxx (Lindsay et al., 2009).
Confocal imaging of transiently expressed GFP-Rassf1A and GFP-Rassf1C in HEp2 cells
also revealed an exclusively cytoplasmic distribution of these proteins, while GFP-Daxx
localization was, in contrast, predominately nuclear (Fig. 2C); same results were obtained
upon double-transfection of Daxx-GFP and Rassf1C-RFP (Fig. 2D). In summary, Daxx and
Rassf1 are compartmentally separated proteins during interphase: Daxx is associated with
PML-NBs in the nucleus, and both Rassf1 isoforms are cytoplasmic. These data confirm
many previous findings of cytosolic deposition of Rassf1; Rassf1A and Rassf1C has been
shown to bind tubulin, and influence microtubule dynamics (reviewed in (Agathanggelou et
al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

Being that Daxx and Rassf1 are compartmentally separated proteins during interphase, we
sought to understand the dynamics of this interaction in cells by first analyzing the
distribution of Daxx and Rassf1 throughout the cell cycle. Previous reports have shown that
Rassf1 is a microtubule-associated protein that associates with the spindle apparatus during
mitosis ((Dallol et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2003); (Rong et al., 2004) and we reasoned that the
interaction between Daxx and Rassf1 may occur primarily at this time. To address this
possibility, we immunostained HEp2 cells with Daxx and Rassf1 antibodies; partial colocalization between Daxx and Rassf1 was observed during pro-metaphase and metaphase
(Fig. 2E), suggesting that the primary stage of cell cycle for Daxx and Rassf1 co-localization
and potential interaction is mitosis and not interphase.

Mapping of Daxx/Rassf1 interaction
As implied from yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. S2), the interaction between Daxx and Rassf1
occurs between the Rassf1C isoform and Daxx. We confirmed this interaction by in vitro
pull-down assay (Fig. S3A). We next mapped the regions of interaction between Daxx,
Rassf1C and Rassf1A using full length or truncation mutants of these molecules in in vitro
pull-down assay.

Human Daxx is a 740 aa protein, while Rassf1A and Rassf1C are 340 aa and 270 aa
proteins, respectively (Fig. 3). Rassf1A and Rassf1C share a common 220 aa carboxylterminal peptide sequence that includes the microtubule binding domain and Ras-association
domain, while their amino-terminal regions are unique: 120 aa for Rassf1A and 50 aa for
Rassf1C.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of several truncation mutants of Daxx and Rassf1C reveals two strong regions of
interaction between these proteins. The first and minimal Rassf1C-interacting region
localizes among the amino terminal 142 aa, while the second one is mapped between aa 290
and 740 of Daxx (I and II in Fig 3 and S3B, correspondingly). Both regions are able to bind
independently to Rassf1C. The N-terminus of Daxx (Daxx1-142) binds to the unique 50 aa
amino-terminal region of Rassf1C (Fig. S3B top panel “I”). Daxx C-terminal region
(Daxx290-740) interacts with Rassf1C full length and with Rassf1C/A common region
(Rassf1C51-270) (Fig. S3B central panel, “II”). We did not observe any specific or significant
interaction of Daxx290-740 with either of the two unique N-terminal regions of Rassf1C and
Rassf1A (Fig. S3B, central panel, “II”). We observed interaction between Rassf1 isoforms
(III, Figs. 3 and S3B, bottom panel), suggesting formation of homo- and heterodimers of
Rassf1A/C. Thus, by in vitro pull down assay we characterized two main regions of
interaction between Rassf1 and Daxx and identified Rassf1A/C dimerization region (I, II,
and III in Fig. 3). Region I was extensively mapped by NMR spectroscopy: interaction
domain of Daxx forms a left-handed unique four-helix bundle, that binds to the aminoterminal residues of Rassf1C (Escobar-Cabrera et al., 2010).
Daxx and Rassf1-Depleted Cells are Resistant to Taxol Treatment

Author Manuscript

To understand the functionality of the cell cycle-dependent interaction of Daxx and Rassf1
upon taxol treatment, we produced HEp2 cells with stable expression of Rassf1A-shRNA
(Fig. 4A). Cells expressing control shRNA, anti-Daxx shRNA, anti-Rassf1A siRNA and
parental HEp2 cells were exposed to 10 nM taxol for 12, 18 and 24 hrs and then re-plated
for colony formation assay. Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells exhibited a strong taxolresistant phenotype with the majority of treated cells (75–80%) capable of dividing and
forming colonies after removal of taxol (Fig. 4B).
Cyclin B is Stabilized in Daxx- and Rassf1-Depleted Cells Treated with Taxol

Author Manuscript

Cells with reduced Daxx display increased resistance to taxol treatment because the majority
of cells arrest in mitosis for longer period of time (and thus are able to complete normal
division upon taxol wash-out), while control cells exit mitosis towards micro-nucleated cells
(and stop proliferation). A similar effect was previously observed upon cell exposure to low
or high taxol concentrations (Lindsay et al., 2007). We sought to understand the taxol
resistance phenomenon more in depth by analyzing the cyclin B levels in synchronized
control, Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells upon 10 nM taxol treatment. Whereas cyclin B
protein levels decreased by 13 hrs post-release in control cells, it was stabilized in Daxxand Rassf1A-depleted cells (Fig. 4C). Stabilized cyclin B upon Daxx or Rassf1A depletion
is a biochemical indication of cells arrested in mitosis, while control cells exit mitosis by
micronucleation, as confirmed morphologically for Daxx-depleted cells (Lindsay et al.,
2007).

Expression Daxx Binding Motif of Rassf1C Increases Taxol Resistance

Author Manuscript

To directly probe the functionality of Daxx-Rassf1 interaction in relation to taxol exposure,
we used the interaction mapping information described in Fig. 3 and S3B. We designed a
minimal Rassf1C mutant for stable over-expression in cells that 1) retains its Daxx-binding
ability and 2) potentially interferes with Daxx-Rassf1C interaction, perturbing taxol
sensitization. We expressed GFP-Rassf1C aa 1-50 and GFP in HEp2 cells (Figure 5A for
expression) and then treated these stable-expressing cell lines along with parental HEp2
cells with 10 nM taxol and re-plated them for colony formation assay. In the case of the
GFP-Rassf1C 1-50 cell line, we observed an overall increase survival after taxol exposure
compared to controls (Fig. 5B). This suggested that Rassf1C 1-50-expressing cells could
survive taxol treatment due to prevention of mitotic slippage towards micronucleation,
brought upon by potential disruption of Daxx-Rassf1C binding.

Analysis of Mitosis-related Proteins upon Daxx depletion
Daxx exhibits transcription repression activity (reviewed in (Lindsay et al., 2008)); thus it
could potentially regulate mitotic progression and taxol sensitivity repressing mitotic
checkpoint proteins. In this regard, Daxx depletion does not change accumulation of several
mitosis-related proteins including Cdc27, Cdc20, and Mad2 (Fig. S4A). No cell cycle
specific changes of Daxx protein level were observed either (Fig. S4B). The combination of
these data may suggest that Daxx-mediated taxol sensitivity is independent of the previously
reported transcription repression activity of Daxx, at least for tested SAC-related proteins,
and more likely is dependent upon the function of a Daxx/Rassf1-specific interaction.
Rassf1A or Daxx are not required for activation of the anaphase promotion complex (APC)
in vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether Rassf1A or Daxx were required for the activity of mitotic E3
ubiquitine ligase APC/C or release from the spindle checkpoint, we utilized an in vitro
system using mitotic extracts, which recapitulates both of these activities (Summers et al.,
2008). APC activity was determined by monitoring the destruction of radio-labeled Securin
which remained stable throughout all extracts derived from cells (control-, Daxx or
Rassf1A-depleted) and confirmed an active spindle checkpoint (Fig S5A). During the
incubation, extracts undergo a slow spontaneous release from spindle checkpoint-mediated
inhibition. The loss of neither Rassf1A nor Daxx did not delay the kinetics of this release,
suggesting that they are not required for direct activation of the APC upon checkpoint
silencing. We tested this idea directly, by asking whether the Mad2 antagonist, p31Comet,
was able to induce APC activity toward Securin in these extracts. Addition of p31Comet to
control as well as Rassf1A or Daxx deficient mitotic extracts (produced from mitotic cells in
either nocodazole or taxol block) resulted in equal activation of the APC and subsequent
destruction of Securin (Fig. S5B) while addition of recombinant Rassf1 and/or Daxx
proteins did not induce activation of the APC (data not shown). Taken together, these results
imply that the prolonged mitotic arrest observed upon manipulation of the Rassf1-Daxx
complex is not due to an inability to activate the APC, at least in vitro. However, as the
mechanism(s) of spindle checkpoint silencing/release are poorly understood, we cannot

exclude that this complex participates in an upstream event that is not recapitulated in our in
vitro settings.
Daxx and Rassf1-Dependent Tumor Response to Taxol

Author Manuscript

Next, we sought to understand the importance of Daxx and Rassf1A in tumor response to
taxol using neoplasm generated by a xenograft system. Taxane-based therapy is one of
treatment options in head and neck cancer (De Mulder, 1999); therefore, we assessed the
anti-neoplastic activity of taxol exerted on tumors generated from control-, Daxx- or
Rassf1A-depleted HEp2 larynx carcinoma cells. By comparing the daily changes in tumor
volume (beginning of treatment at approximately 150 mm3 of tumor) between taxol and
vehicle treated groups, we could determine regressions in tumor growth. As human tumor
xenografts were administered taxol, response of control neoplasms compared to vehicle was
markedly sharper due to the sudden drop in volume even after the first injection of drug. The
regression trend was observed further after the 2nd-5th drug administration from day 4–11
(Fig. 6B). This drug response, in contrast, was reduced in Daxx or Rassf1A-depleted
xenografts as the sizes of taxol-treated tumors in these groups closely followed that of
vehicle-administered tumors. The residual tumor size (calculated as a ratio of sizes between
taxol-injected to vehicle-injected tumors at the end of experiment) of Daxx- and Rassf1Adepleted tumors after five administrations of taxol averaged to be 0.65 and 0.66,
respectively, while the residual size of control-depleted tumors was much smaller at 0.27
(Fig. 6A). We concluded that tumors generated from Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells had
reduced response rate to taxol administration compared to control-depleted tumors.

Author Manuscript

We reasoned that the differential taxol response of these tumor groups may, in part, be
linked to the cellular outcomes as documented previously (Lindsay et al., 2007): taxolresistant cells arrest in a prolonged mitotic state with sustained cyclin B protein levels and
continue cell division upon drug decay, while non-resistant cells exit mitosis forming
micronucleated cells incapable of entering next cycle. To address this possibility, we
analyzed cellular morphology at tumor xenografts sections. Based on DNA staining, cells
were categorized as 1) interphase, 2) mitosis, 3) apoptosis, and 4) micronuclei (Lindsay et
al., 2007). In control shRNA xenografts, we observed an increased number of
micronucleated cells (indication of taxol response) after 2nd and 5th injections of taxol,
elevating to 50% at the end of treatment. In contrast, the number of interphase and mitotic
cells (indication of taxol resistance) in Daxx- and Rassf1 depleted xenografts remained high,
while micronuclei were low (less than 10% at the end of treatment), suggesting that cells
keep cycling (Fig. 6C). Occurrence of apoptotic cells was similar across all xenografts and
increased marginally upon taxol exposure. Thus, in current experimental settings, depletion
of Daxx and Rassf1 elevated resistance of experimental tumors to taxol treatment, with
majority of cells continuously cycling – while tumors derived from control-depleted cells
formed micronuclei and thus stop proliferation.

standard taxane and anthracycline based neoadjuvant chemotherapy at H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center were identified for this study. Patients were classified as either responders or
non responders based on the clinical response measured with the longest diameter by
physical examination performed by the treating physician at the time of encounter, with
responders experiencing >75% reduction. Daxx score was calculated based on the Daxx IHC
staining intensity multiplied by the percent of staining cells. Based on the above definition
of response, 10 patients were classified as responders and twelve as non-responders.
Comparison of pretreatment samples between the responders and non-responders was
performed using an independent sample t test. Responders to therapy had a higher mean
Daxx score compared to non-responders (Fig. 7; p=0.06). This data suggested that Daxx
score could predict the response to neoadjuvant taxane and anthracycline based
chemotherapy. The small sample size and the retrospective nature of the study are the main
limitation of this finding that will be further validated in a future prospective study.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Taxane chemotherapy is considered among the most responsive treatment options for many
cancer patients, either alone or as adjuvant in combination with anthracyclins
(O'Shaughnessy, 2005). Nevertheless, large numbers of patients are resistant or become
resistant to taxane therapy during treatment. The response rate of docetaxel is ~50% even
after the first-line chemotherapy administration and decreases to 20–30% by second- or
third-line administration (Bonneterre et al., 1999; Crown et al., 2004). Thus, development of
new genomic prognosis factors and in-depth understanding of drug activity on both a
cellular and organism levels are needed for optimization of adjuvant therapy and proper
patient stratification. Numerous studies have been carried out to determine a genomic profile
that could be predictive to taxane treatment (Chang et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2005; IwaoKoizumi et al., 2005; Mauriac et al., 2005; Miyoshi et al., 2004) while alternative
approaches have sought to understand selective resistance to taxanes to decipher
mechanisms which regulate responses (Hari et al., 2003a; Hari et al., 2003b); (Wang and
Cabral, 2005). Inactivation of mitotic proteins can contribute to the selective response of
taxane treatment in vivo (Wassmann and Benezra, 2001). Divergent response to taxol
exposure is usually seen in cells deficient of mitotic checkpoint proteins or other regulators
of cell division. To date, loss of function of the majority of mitotic proteins, including Mad1,
Mad2, Bub1 and BubR1, among others, has shown enhanced response to taxol in cell culture
conditions, implying increased output of micronucleation instead of mitotic arrest (Lee et
al., 2004); (Carvalho et al., 2003); (Lens et al., 2003). Hence, identification of factors, that
increase drug resistance upon inactivation, is largely incomplete or uncharacterized.

To this end, Daxx was verified as a novel regulator of taxol response in cell culture
conditions, animal models and primary human tumor specimens. Human breast cancer cells
and larynx carcinoma HEp2 cells with experimentally modified levels of Daxx, show
reduced responses to taxol as previously described (Lindsay et al., 2007). A mouse
xenograft system also recapitulates our initial findings, becoming the first indication that
Daxx and its interaction partner Rassf1 could be important for the fate of tumors exposed to
taxane based chemotherapy (Fig. 6A, B). We also found that control groups displayed an
increased amount of micronucleation upon taxol treatment, which may account for the rapid

loss of xenografts tumor volume observed in these regimental settings (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted tumors displayed increased mitotic and interphase index (Fig.
6C), indicating that cells were capable to maintain mitotic block via elevated cyclin B
stability (Fig. 4C) and continue proliferation after taxol decay that happens fast in nude mice
(Kubota et al., 1997). Thus, mitotic cells from Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted tumors can
potentially reenter G1 after drug decay, providing a working model for how cells or tumors
devoid of either of these protein targets can survive chemotherapy treatment and proliferate
(Model in Fig S6).

The nature of Daxx function in cells is largely attributed to regulation of apoptosis or
transcription. While this functionality is debatable in many circumstances, the prevailing
idea of the role of Daxx is that of a modulator or adapter of many cellular functions which
are critical to cell vitality (Lindsay et al., 2008). Indeed, Daxx has been found critical and
necessary for embryonic development in mice as Daxx−/− embryos exhibit extensive
apoptosis and lethality by E11.5 (Michaelson et al., 1999b); (Ishov et al., 2004). Many
Daxx-interacting proteins have also been described including the interaction between Daxx
and Rassf1C (Kitagawa et al., 2006), (Song et al., 2008). We further characterized this
interaction by analyzing the dynamics of cell cycle distribution of Daxx/Rassf1C. Rassf1C
(endogenous or transiently expressed, Fig. 2A-D) is exclusively cytoplasmic-associated
protein and does not reside at PML bodies during interphase, as previously suggested in
(Kitagawa et al., 2006). Moreover, cytolpasmic localization of Rassf1 was unaffected by the
presence or absence of Daxx (Fig. 2A). In light of these findings, it is difficult to explain the
suggested role of Daxx/Rassf1C interaction in Fas-induced apoptosis (Kitagawa et al.,
2006). We demonstrated that Rassf1C is able to bind Daxx by its unique amino-terminal
region (I, Fig. 3 and S3B top panel). We also show that Rassf1A and Rassf1C, the two major
isoforms of Rassf1 in cells, interact with each other and with Daxx through a common
region in their carboxyl-termini by in vitro pull-down assay (III, III, I, Figs. 3 and S3B
middle and bottom panel ).
Rassf1A has been implicated as a mitotic regulator and has been shown to interact with
several key mitotic-related proteins, including Aurora A (Rong et al., 2007) and Cdc20
(Song et al., 2004), though the latter is debatable (Liu et al., 2007). These findings together
with out data indicate that Rassf1A has a pleiotropic effect during mitosis. This may justify
the elevated accumulation of Cyclin B observed upon depletion of Rassf1A and taxol
exposure (Fig. 4C).

Author Manuscript

The interaction partners of Rassf1C have until now been limited to Daxx, BetaTrCP,
IGFBP-5 (Amaar et al., 2005); (Kitagawa et al., 2006); (Estrabaud et al., 2007) with the
cellular functions of Rassf1C, comparatively, being much less studied. Since Rassf1A and
Rassf1C have many seemingly unrelated interaction partners, the implications of a Rassf1ARassf1C interaction via common protein region suggests a converging point of cellular
networks and pathways that may have otherwise been unlinked. It is possible that Daxx,
Rassf1A and Rassf1C may form three-party functional mitotic complex where Rassf1C
may, at least in some cases, serve as a functional “bridge” between Daxx and Rassf1A as
over-expressing a construct with the Daxx-interacting amino-terminal region of Rassf1C

(Fig. 5) effectively recapitulates taxol resistance phenotypes seen in Daxx and Rassf1Adepleted cells (Fig. 4B) and xenograft models (Fig. 6).

Author Manuscript

In addition to function in taxol response, we also report an unexpected role of Daxx in the
regulation of mitosis. In the absence of Daxx, the duration of prophase and the
prometaphase/metaphase transition is altered (Table 1). Indeed, the stability of cyclin B
protein is changed in the absence of Daxx as well (Fig. 1B). This may suggest that the
activity of E3 ubiquitin ligase APC is altered in the absence of Daxx. We attempted to study
the role of Daxx and Rassf1 as direct regulators of APC using an in vitro assay, but the
results were undistinguishable (Fig. S5), suggesting that cellular in vivo mitotic environment
is necessary for proper execution of Daxx/Rassf1 function in mitosis. Differential
degradation of cyclin B in Daxx-depleted cells could also be due to mis-regulation of cyclin
B on a different operational level, namely, the alteration in stability of the APC activator
Cdc20 (Nilsson et al., 2008). However, we found no differences in and accumulation of
Cdc20 as well as Cdc27 and Mad2 (Fig. S4A). In addition our results indicate that upon
Daxx or Rassf1 depletion and taxane exposure both dynamics of degradation and/or
accumulation of cyclin B levels are affected. To date, we cannot explain this phenomenon,
although it suggests that Daxx or Rassf1-mediated regulation of Cyclin B may occurs at
multiple levels. Thus, the detailed mechanism and players underlying the functions of Daxx
in mitotic progression remain largely unknown and future studies aimed at unraveling cell
cycle-specific roles of Daxx are required.

Author Manuscript

Evidences presented in this study suggest Daxx and Rassf1 are triggers for cellular taxol
sensitivity, that together with the recently reported function of Daxx in the transcription
repression of the pro-metastatic tyrosine kinase receptor c-met (Morozov et al., 2008) may
further uncover Daxx function in tumor progression. In the future, Daxx and Rassf1 may
serve as useful molecular markers for proper selection of cancer patients for taxane
chemotherapy. In order to achieve this goal, clinical studies additional to presented here
(Fig. 7) will be required examining the status of Daxx and Rassf1 expression in tumors
before and after taxane treatment as well as studies in patients with an established history of
taxane resistance. Daxx expression vary in breast cancer cell lines (Lindsay et al., 2007), but
the mechanism of Daxx down-regulation has largely been unstudied. Rassf1A expression in
cancer cell lines, conversely, has been extensively covered and shown to be down-regulated
in a majority of cases (Agathanggelou et al., 2005). Our studies have established new roles
for Daxx in cell cycle progression—the importance of which may be intensified because of
its function as a trigger for taxol sensitization in combination with Rassf1—which adds to
our understanding of mechanisms linking cell division, chemotherapy response and cancer
progression.

Figure 1. Daxx-dependent stability of cyclin B

A) Western blot analysis of Daxx depletion in HEp2 cells. B) Control- and Daxx-depleted
HEp2 cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block (0 hr) and then released into
normal media for progression through mitosis (6–11 hrs). Top: Western blot analysis of
cyclin B protein stability. Bottom: Relative quantization of cyclin B protein levels
(normalized to actin). Cyclin B protein is stabilized longer in Daxx-depleted cells (at 9.5–11
hrs, post-thymidine release), indicating that Daxx-depleted cells are delayed in mitosis. Data
show a representative experiment out of four.

Figure 2. Cell cycle dependent localization of Rassf1 C/A and Daxx

A) Rassf1C/A and Daxx localization during interphase. Control- (top) and Daxx-depleted
(bottom) HEp2 cells were immunostained for Rassf1C/A (green) and Daxx (red); DNA
(blue) for nuclear visualization. Note nuclear localization of Daxx in PML NBs (top).
Cytoplasmic localization of Rassf1C/A is unaltered upon Daxx depletion (bottom). B)
Biochemical fractionation of cells shows differential localization of Daxx/Rassf1 proteins.
HEp2 cells were separated into nuclear (N) and cytosolic (C) fractions. Daxx is found in
HP1-alpha containing nuclear fractions, while Rassf1 is found in tubulin-containing

cytoplasmic fractions. C) Distribution of GFP-Rassf1A, GFP-Rassf1C and GFP-Daxx in
HEp2 cells. GFP-Rassf1A (left), -Rassf1C (middle) and -Daxx (right) were transiently
transfected into HEp2 cells and then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Note that
distribution of both Rassf1 isoforms (Rassf1A and Rassf1C) is exclusively cytoplasmic
(compare XY, XZ and YZ planes), while, in contrast, the distribution of Daxx is exclusively
nuclear. D) Distribution of Daxx-GFP and Rassf1C-RFP upon double transfection in HEp2
cells. Daxx-GFP is nuclear mostly accumulating in domains (PML NBs), while Rassf1C is
cytoplasmic. E) Partial co-localization of Daxx and Rassf1 during mitotic stages. HEp2 cells
were immunostained with Rassf1C/A ab (green) and Daxx (red).

Figure 3. Mapping Daxx and Rassf1 regions of interaction

Diagram depicting human Daxx, Rassf1A and Rassf1C and their mutual regions of
interaction summarizing results obtained by in vitro pull down assay (Fig. S3). The fist
region of interaction (I) was identified between Daxx first 142 aa and Rassf1C unique Nterminus. The second region of interaction (II) is mapped between Daxx C-terminus (Daxx
290-740) and Rassf1C/A common region. The third region (III) involves the common
region of Rassf1A and Rassf1C indicating that the two molecules may homo- or heterodimerize via their common region.

Figure 4. Depletion of Daxx or Rassf1 increases taxol resistance and prolongs Cyclin B stability

A) Western blot analysis of Daxx and Rassf1A depletion in HEp2 cells. B) Colony
formation assay of parental, control- Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells exposed to 10 nM
taxol for 12, 18, and 24 hrs after release from double thymidine block. Rapid decrease in
survival is seen in parental and control cells, while Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells
withstood taxol treatment and produced colonies. C) Western blot analysis of cyclin B
protein stability in HEp2 control-, Daxx- and Rassf1A-siRNA cell lines treated with taxol
for the indicated amount of time (6–22 hrs). Cells were synchronized using a double

thymidine block and released (0 hr) into normal media containing 10 nM taxol. The bottom
panel: densitometry analysis of cyclin B normalized by actin; for each cell line the cyclin B/
actin ratio at 0 hr set as 1.0. Whereas cyclin B protein levels rapidly decrease by 13 hrs postthymidine release in control shRNA cells, cyclin B protein levels were stabilized longer in
Daxx- and Rassf1A-depleted cells (through 22 hrs, post-thymidine release), indicating Daxx
and Rassf1A-depletion prolongs exit from mitosis in response to taxol exposure. Data show
a representative experiment out of three.

Figure 6. Depletion of Daxx or Rassf1 increases resistance of experimental tumors to taxol

Control-, Daxx- or Rassf1A-depleted tumors derived from injection of HEp2 cells into
Nu/Nu mice were treated with vehicle or 20mg/kg taxol. A) Table summarizing key
statistical data generated from tumors exposed to vehicle or taxol regimens. Relative tumor
sizes for vehicle (A) or taxol-treated tumors (B) were recorded at the end of treatment and
the relative residual tumor volumes were calculated by dividing the values from (B) over
(A). B) Graphs charting the changes in relative tumor size of control-, Daxx- or Rassf1Adepleted xenografts exposed to vehicle or taxol. Asterisks at day number (x axis) denote

time of injection of vehicle or taxol (days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Note discrepancy in tumor growth in
vehicle and taxol treated tumors in control shRNA groups, while the rate of growth in Daxxand Rassf1A-shRNA groups exposed to taxol have reduced response. C) Treatment
response at cellular level. Tumor xenografts were extracted 24 hours following the 2nd or 5th
taxol injection or at the end of experiment (day 15) and cellular response was analyzed
based on appearance of chromatin (stained for DNA) by light microscopy and characterized
as 1) interphase, 2) mitotic, 3) micronucleated, and 4) apoptotic as described previously
(Lindsay et al., 2007). Control xenografts exhibited an increased number of micronucleated
cells (indication of taxol response), while Daxx and Rassf1A-depleted xenografts show
increased numbers of mitotic and interphase cells (indication of taxol resistance and
continuous proliferation) and correspondingly less micronuclei; number apoptotic cells is
similar in all groups.

Figure 7. Daxx levels have reverse correlation with taxane chemotherapy response in breast
cancer patients

Author Manuscript

Twenty-two women with breast cancer who were treated with standard taxane and
anthracycline based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were classified as either responders (up to
75% reduction of tumor size; 10 patients) or non-responders (less than 75% reduction of
tumor size; 12 patients). Daxx score was calculated based on the Daxx IHC staining
intensity multiplied by the percent of staining cells. Comparison of pretreatment samples
between the responders and non-responders was performed using an independent sample t
test. Responders to therapy had a higher mean Daxx score compared to non-responders
(p=0.06).
