Abstract
Internal human xenografts provide valuable animal models
to study the microenvironments and metastatic processes
occurring in human cancers. However, the use of such models
is hampered by the logistical difficulties of reproducibly and
simply assessing tumor burden. We developed a highsensitivity assay for quantifying human DNA in small volumes
of mouse plasma, enabling in-life monitoring of systemic
tumor burden. Growth kinetics analyses of various xenograft
models showed the utility of circulating human DNA as a
biomarker. We found that human DNA concentration reproducibly increased with disease progression and decreased
after successful therapeutic intervention. A marked, transient
spike in circulating human tumor DNA occurred immediately
after cytotoxic therapy or surgery. This simple assay may find
broad utility in target validation studies and preclinical drug
development programs. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9364–70]

Introduction
Animal models have been essential to our understanding of
human cancer. Subcutaneous tumors in mice are most often used
to evaluate issues relating to tumorigenicity and therapy, as tumor
growth can be easily measured in such systems by visual
inspection. However, it is increasingly recognized that host stroma
plays a major role in tumorigenesis and that the stromal factors in
internal organs such as liver and lung are not the same as those
in subcutaneous tissues (1–5). Cancer researchers are therefore
gradually turning to human xenograft models in which tumors are
formed internally, either through metastasis or implantation, to
more accurately mimic human disease (6, 7).
The major experimental problem with internal tumors is their
quantitative assessment. Accordingly, many sophisticated methods
have been devised to follow such tumors in mice. Direct imaging
methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed
tomography, are useful in this regard but they can only detect
relatively large tumors and require expensive equipment (8).
Imaging with fluorescent or luminescent markers provides much
greater sensitivity but also requires genetic engineering of the cell
lines to introduce markers (9). The introduction of such markers can
itself alter the growth characteristics of tumors (10). Moreover, direct
or indirect imaging methods require that animals be anaesthetized
and the imaging process takes a considerable amount of time.

Imaging methods are therefore not well-suited for situations in which
multiple sequential measurements on many mice are desirable.
In light of these problems, several studies have evaluated
biochemical measurements ex vivo for internal tumor assessment.
For example, tumor cells engineered to secrete human chorionic
gonadotrophin can be monitored through the evaluation of the
urine (11). Like the imaging methods noted above, this approach
requires genetic engineering of each cell line to be evaluated.
A more generally applicable approach is to use human DNA as a
marker of tumor burden. Indeed, the concentration of human
DNA sequences can be quantitatively assessed by real-time PCR
and this principle has been applied to measure human tumor cells
in the solid organs of mice, rats, and chickens (12–15). There has
also been one recent report of the application of this approach to
circulating DNA in mice harboring human ovarian xenografts (16).
However, the DNA quantification method described in ref. 16
required the sacrifice of the mice to collect sufficient plasma for
detection of human sequences. We have independently developed
a facile approach that is more sensitive and allows repeated
measurements from small amounts of plasma (<25 AL) collected
from the tail veins of mice. As shown below, this technique can be
effectively used to monitor the development of tumors in a variety
of models and to track the efficacy of therapeutic measures.

Materials and Methods
Animals, cell lines, and reagents. All experimental procedures were in
compliance with U.S. laws governing animal experimentation and were
approved and overseen by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and
Use Committee. Female athymic nude mice 3 to 8 weeks of age were
purchased from Harlan. The HCT116 parental cell line and a derivative
clone retaining only the mutant PIK3CA allele were derived as previously
described (17). The thymidine kinase expressing osteosarcoma (143B-PMLBK-TK) and the LS 174T colorectal adenocarcinoma (ATCC no. CL-188) cell
lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines
were grown as monolayers in McCoy’s 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 0.9% penicillinstreptomycin solution (Invitrogen) at 37jC and 5% CO2. Ganciclovir was
purchased from Roche and used at 100 mg/kg delivered by i.p. injection.
Subcutaneous and metastatic tumor models. Suspensions of 5  106
HCT116 parental cells in 0.1 mL of culture media were injected s.c. into the
flank of mice. Tumors were measured with an electronic digital caliper
(AVID) at the time indicated in the text. Tumor volume was calculated as
length (L)  width2 (W)  0.5. Metastatic models were established by
injection of one million tumor cells in 500 AL of 1 PBS (HCT116) or 100 AL
of McCoy’s 5A medium (Cl-188) via the tail vein.
Orthotopic and ectopic tumor models. Tumor fragments were
prepared via s.c. injection of 1  105 HCT116 or 143B cells in the flank of
athymic nude mice. After subcutaneous tumors reached a size of 500 to
1,000 mm3, the mice were euthanized and the tumors were removed and

placed in ice-cold 1 PBS (Invitrogen). For internal tumor implantation,
athymic nude female mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (SurgiVet)
and the abdomen was scrubbed for surgery. A small incision was made
parallel to the linea alba and the cecum was exteriorized. A single fragment
of tumor of f1 mm3 in size was implanted on the serosal surface. An
absorbable suture (3–0 Vicryl) was used to attach the tumor to the serosal
wall without penetrating the inner layers of the intestine. The organ was
returned to the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wall was closed. For
transplantation to hepatic sites, an incision was made in the ventral left
upper abdominal quadrant. The left lobe of the liver was carefully exposed
and a blunt needle was used to puncture the liver capsule. A single fragment
of tumor of f0.5 mm3 in size was then placed in the hole made by the
needle. After hemostasis, the abdomen and skin were closed.
Plasma preparation. Whole venous blood was accessed by tail prick with
a 26 1/2–gauge needle or scalpel blade and collected directly into a disposable
EDTA-coated plastic capillary tube (Hematronics) or aspirated by pipette.
Twenty-five microliters of whole blood was added to 200 AL of 1 PBS
containing 4.5 mmol/L of EDTA (Invitrogen) in a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube
(Corning Life Sciences) and subjected to centrifugation at 1,500  g for
15 min at room temperature. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at 80jC.
Human LINE quantification. DNA was purified from 100 AL of the
diluted plasma samples using the QIAamp DNA micro kit (Qiagen) as
recommended by the manufacturer with 1 AL of carrier RNA per 100 AL of
AL buffer, eluted in 40 AL of EB buffer, and stored at 80jC. PCR was done

in 25 AL with the following components: 13.75 AL sterile tissue culture grade
double-distilled water (Invitrogen), 2.5 AL of 10 PCR buffer, 2.5 AL of
10 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates (U.S. Biochemical) 1.5 AL of
DMSO (Sigma), 0.5 AL of SYBR Green I solution (Invitrogen) diluted 1:1,000
in double-distilled water, 0.5 AL of 50 Amol/L forward primer FWD
5¶-TCACTCAAAGCCGCTCAACTAC-3¶ (Invitrogen; desalted, 25 nmol scale),
0.5 AL of 50 Amol/L reverse primer REV 5¶-TCTGCCTTCATTTCGTTATGTACC-3¶ (Invitrogen; desalted, 25 nmol scale), 0.25 AL of Platinum taq
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 3 AL of purified DNA. The 10 PCR
buffer contained 670 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 67 mmol/L of MgCl2,
166 mmol/L of (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mmol/L of 2-mercaptoethanol (18).
Purified DNA from plasma was used directly without further dilution. The
reaction was monitored on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) with the following cycling
conditions: (94jC, 2 min)  1, (94jC, 10 s; 67jC, 15 s; 70jC, 15 s)  3, (94jC,
10 s; 64jC, 15 s; 70jC, 15 s)  3, (94jC, 10 s; 61jC, 15 s; 70jC, 15 s)  3,
(94jC, 10 s; 59jC, 15 s; 70jC, 15 s)  35. The threshold cycle number was
determined using Bio-Rad analysis software (version 3.0.6070) with the
PCR baseline subtracted. Various dilutions of normal human DNA purified
from lymphocytes were incorporated in each plate to serve as standards.
The numbers of mice per group are noted in the figure legends and all
experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SD. Student’s t test
(unpaired) was used as indicated in the text to compare continuous
variables. The statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results
High-sensitivity detection of human DNA in mouse plasma.
To measure systemic xenograft burdens in various mouse models,
we sought to develop a sensitive method for quantifying human
DNA in small volumes of mouse plasma. The human long
interspersed nuclear element-1 (hLINE-1) retrotransposon family
members were ideal for this purpose because f100,000 of these
elements exist in the human genome and, as shown below, a subset
of these copies can be distinguished from mouse orthologues (19).
The prototypical human LINE-1 consists of a 5¶ untranslated region
(5¶-UTR; nucleotide, 1–910), open reading frame (ORF) 1 (nucleotide, 911–1927), ORF2 (nucleotide, 1991–5818), and a 3¶-UTR
(nucleotide, 5819–6049) as depicted in Fig. 1A. Using the BLAST
algorithm (20), we found 81,587 matches of the canonical hLINE-1
(GenBank accession no. M80343) sequence in the human genome.
Because members of the hLINE-1 family are known to be truncated
(21), we generated a copy number map that allowed us to exclude
regions with low abundance from primer design (Fig. 1B). The
nucleotide start and stop positions for each entry were used to
determine the presence of hLINE-1 subfragments among family
members. For example, we found that the 5¶-UTR was frequently
truncated such that nucleotide positions 500 to 650 were only
found in 6,253 (7.7%) of the 81,587 matches. On the other hand, the
3¶-end of ORF2 (nucleotide positions, 5500–5650) was found within
36,936 hLINE-1 elements, representing 45.3% of all entries. Because

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

hLINE-1 family members are divergent at the nucleotide level, we
used the BLAT algorithm (22) to confirm the number of exact
matches in the human genome for each candidate primer (data not
shown) before they were tested empirically.
Optimization of human LINE-1 primer specificity. In silico
PCR (23) was used to eliminate candidate primer sets that were
predicted to amplify mouse DNA, as sequences related to hLINE-1
are present in mice. The high sequence similarity of the mouse Igl
gene (GenBank accession no. NG_004051) made this gene
particularly difficult to exclude. As we expected that human DNA
would represent only a tiny fraction of the total DNA present in
the plasma of mice with tumors, it was critical to avoid any
amplification of mouse DNA. We therefore focused on regions of
hLINE-1 that were highly represented in the human genome but
which were as unrelated as possible to those in mouse. Empirical
testing of >30 primer combinations using human and mouse
DNA templates eventually allowed us to identify a primer set
(see Materials and Methods) that amplified abundant human
sequences within ORF2 but did not coamplify mouse sequences.
The amplicon generated from the optimal primer set contained
nucleotide positions 2715 to 2796. Control experiments showed that
there was a linear correlation between the amount of human DNA and
the log of the threshold cycle number of real-time PCR data (Fig. 1C).
The resultant assay was termed plasma LINE-1 optimized
threshold (PLOT). Mouse plasma did not inhibit this assay when

done as described in Materials and Methods, and the limit of
detection was f0.06 pg of human DNA/AL plasma or f0.01 human
cell genomes/AL of plasma. This limit was defined by PCR signals
that arise at f25 to 27 cycles in plasma from mice without tumors,
presumably due to background human DNA contamination. These
background levels were consistent with the effective laboratory
background of human DNA as defined by forensic criteria to be
0.0174 pg/AL with a range between 0.0119 and 0.0549 pg/AL (24).
Biological and technical issues. Studies in humans have shown
that tumor DNA is often present in the plasma of cancer patients,
particularly those with metastatic disease (25, 26). In such patients,
the tumor DNA is generally degraded and amplicons of small size
(f100 bases) are required for detection (27). We assumed that the
plasma DNA from human xenografts would similarly be degraded.
The primer set used for PLOT generated an 82 bp amplicon,
allowing the detection of small circulating hLINE-1 DNA molecules.
In the metastatic models described below, we found that this
82 bp hLINE-1 DNA fragment was f8- to 10-fold more highly
represented in mouse plasma than a 150 bp fragment encompassing it, presumably due to degradation of the larger fragments in
plasma. It is important to note that fragments of hLINE-1 are
ubiquitous wherever humans are found. In the course of method
development, we found that the maximum sensitivity of the assay
was affected by the scale and source of primers. We compared
primers from various commercial suppliers and found that the
desalted, 25 nmol scale synthesis from Invitrogen yielded the least
amount of contamination. In addition, every new batch of primer,
as well as every component of the PCR mix, was carefully screened
to ensure that it was not contaminated with human DNA.
PLOT in experimental models of malignancy. To determine
whether hLINE-1 sequences could be detected in the plasma of
mice bearing human tumor xenografts, we injected human
colorectal cancer cells into the tail vein of athymic nude mice.
The cell line chosen was an HCT116 derivative in which the wildtype PIK3CA allele was inactivated by targeted homologous
integration. This cell line retained an endogenous mutant PIK3CA
allele (arginine substituted for histidine at codon 1047) and
metastasized widely when systemically injected into nude mice
(17). The mice developed cachexia and metastatic deposits in a
variety of target organs over 8 to 16 weeks (Fig. 2A). Ten mice were
injected with tumor cells and serial blood samples of 25 AL were
taken from the tail vein. From these samples, the plasma fraction
was collected, DNA was purified and the hLINE-1 content was
measured by quantitative PCR (Fig. 2B). In tumor-bearing mice,
hLINE-1 DNA became detectable in plasma 23 days after i.v.
injection of cells. This was weeks before any animal developed
tumors (Fig. 2A) or developed any other signs of illness. The
quantity of hLINE-1 DNA increased with time and plateaued at f60
days following injection. The assay also provided a large dynamic
range, apparent in Fig. 2B, with plasma hLINE-1 DNA increasing by
>1,000-fold over the course of the experiment.
To determine if plasma DNA could be used to monitor tumor
progression in other tumor models, three additional systems
were studied. Two systems employed HCT116 tumor fragments
which were implanted orthotopically onto the cecum (Fig. 3A) or
directly into the liver (Fig. 3B). A third system involved the i.v.
injection of a colorectal cancer line, CL-188 (Fig. 3C; ref. 28). In
all three of these models, hLINE-1 DNA became detectable in the
plasma within 8 to 17 days following tumor initiation. As with
the experiment depicted in Fig. 2, the concentrations of plasma
hLINE-1 DNA were very similar in mice sampled at identical time

of plasma hLINE-1 DNA in individual athymic nude mice was determined at
the indicated times after orthotopic transplantation of HCT116 tumor fragments to
the cecum (A), direct transplantation of HCT116 tumor fragments
to the liver (B ), or i.v. injection of CL-188 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (C ).
Three mice for each model are represented individually in A–C .

points. The data in Fig. 3 also illustrates that individual mice can
be readily followed over time and that internal tumor progression
in each mouse can be readily monitored in a noninvasive manner.
Concentration of plasma hLINE-1 DNA is related to tumor
volume. To determine the relationship between tumor burden
and plasma hLINE-1 DNA, we established subcutaneous tumors
from HCT116 cells. Tumors became evident 5 to 7 days after
injection and increased in size by f5.5-fold between days 11 and
25, with growth slowing thereafter (Fig. 4A). Plasma hLINE-1 DNA
became detectable 10 days after injection, increased f5.8-fold
between days 11 and 25, then plateaued (Fig. 4B). Note that tumor
volume is only an approximate measure of viable tumor cells, as
tumors contain necrotic regions, particularly as they reach large
sizes, as well as nonneoplastic cells. Likewise, circulating DNA is
only an approximate measure of tumor burden as it reflects
dynamic states involving necrosis and apoptosis (29). Given these
uncertainties, the data in Fig. 4 show a reasonable correlation
between plasma hLINE-1 DNA and tumor bulk. Interestingly,
plasma hLINE-1 DNA concentrations were considerably lower in
mice with subcutaneous tumors compared with internal tumors
(compare Fig. 4 with Figs. 2 and 3, noting the different scales for
the Y-axis). This could be a result of the lack of invasiveness of
subcutaneous compared with internal tumors. Alternatively,
subcutaneous tumors may have fewer neoplastic cells per crosssectional tumor burden than internal tumors, leading to less
circulating tumor-specific DNA.
The subcutaneous tumor model also provided a means to
determine the half-life of hLINE-1 DNA in plasma. Tumors were
surgically removed at day 40, resulting in an 86% decrease in
plasma hLINE-1 DNA 6 h later (Fig. 4B). By 29 h, plasma hLINE-1
DNA was no longer detectable over the background levels.
PLOT as a biomarker for therapeutic response. The correlation
between plasma hLINE-1 DNA and tumor burden and its rapid
decline after tumor excision suggested that plasma hLINE-1 DNA
might serve as a biomarker for nonsurgical forms of therapy. To test
this possibility, we used an osteosarcoma cell line (OSTK) that had
been modified to express thymidine kinase, thereby making it highly
sensitive to ganciclovir. Tumor fragments from a subcutaneous
xenograft of OSTK were implanted in the livers of athymic nude mice.
The mice were then treated daily with ganciclovir or with vehicle alone
on days 20 to 24. A potent therapeutic response was observed as
hLINE-1 DNA levels in the treated group showed an initial increase
followed by a decrease to below pretreatment levels by day 27. This
pattern was not observed in the control group (Fig. 5A). A linear plot
from individual mice revealed a cumulative treatment-related spike in
hLINE-1 DNA at day 23. This was present in all mice evaluated (one
representative example is shown in Fig. 5B). On average, a 7.5-fold
spike in plasma hLINE-1 DNA was noted in ganciclovir-treated mice,
in contrast to mice treated with vehicle alone (P < 0.05, unpaired t
test) where no such spike was observed. Dissection of mice following
therapy confirmed the eradication of tumor in all treated mice and
the persistence of tumor in control mice, with an average tumor
volume of 3.19 F 1.75 cm3 SD at necropsy.
To compare the results of chemotherapy in this model with
those of surgery, we surgically resected the lobe of the liver into
which tumor fragments had been injected 27 days earlier. Prior to
surgical resection, serial measurements showed gradually increasing plasma hLINE-1 DNA concentrations. Immediately after tumor
resection, all mice exhibited a spike in hLINE-1 DNA levels
(Fig. 5C). Within a few hours thereafter, a rapid decline in plasma
hLINE-1 DNA levels was noted in all mice.

Discussion
These results show that circulating DNA can be used to
monitor neoplastic development in mice bearing human xenograft
tumors in a variety of organs. Additionally, they show that plasma
hLINE-1 DNA is an excellent indicator of the response to therapy.
In this regard, a decrease in plasma hLINE-1 DNA routinely
occurred after treatment with chemotherapy or surgery. What was
more surprising was the seemingly paradoxical increase in plasma
hLINE-1 DNA that occurred immediately following chemotherapeutic treatment or surgery and before a decrease became
apparent. Evidently, cytotoxic agents cause the release of a burst
of tumor DNA into the circulation. Similarly, the tumor resection
itself may have caused tumor cell death resulting in a release of
tumor DNA into the circulation during the surgical procedure.
Transient increases in tumor DNA in the circulation following
therapy are not unprecedented. In humans, circulating EBV DNA
seem to increase after surgical resection of nasopharyngeal
carcinomas (30). While the current study was in progress, Kamat
et al. reported that circulating tumor DNA increased 1 day
following treatment of intraperitoneal ovarian tumors with
docetaxel (16).
In aggregate, these studies suggest that the assay of circulating
tumor-specific DNA will be generally useful for the study of human
xenografts in cancer biology and drug discovery. The observations

made in this manuscript, if extendable to humans, also suggest
that circulating tumor DNA may be a surrogate marker for tumor
burden and can be used to rapidly predict the efficacy of cytotoxic
anticancer agents. Recent reports from our group and others show
that tumor-specific mutations can be detected and quantified in
the circulation of patients with metastatic colorectal cancers and
melanomas (27, 31). Future studies using circulating tumorspecific DNA from preclinical models and patients with cancer
will further define the utility of these biomarkers in cancer
research.
