ABSTRACT
Increased glycolysis and overexpression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) are
physiological characteristics of human malignancies. Based on the so-called Warburg
effect, 18flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has successfully
developed as clinical modality for the diagnosis and staging of many cancers. To
leverage this glucose transporter mediated metabolic disparity between normal and
malignant cells, in the current report, we focus on the fluorine substituted series of
glucose, mannose and galactose-conjugated (trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)2-flouromalonato-platinum(II) complexes for a comprehensive evaluation on their
selective tumor targeting. Besides highly improved water solubility, these sugarconjugates presented improved cytotoxicity than oxaliplatin in glucose tranporters
(GLUTs) overexpressing cancer cell lines and exhibited no cross-resistance to cisplatin.
For the highly water soluble glucose-conjugated complex (5a), two novel in vivo
assessments were conducted and the results revealed that 5a was more efficacious at a
lower equitoxic dose (70% MTD) than oxaliplatin (100% MTD) in HT29 xenograft model,
and it was significantly more potent than oxaliplatin in leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice
as well even at equimolar dose levels (18% vs 90% MTD). GLUT inhibitor mediated cell
viability analysis, GLUT1 knockdown cell line-based cytotoxicity evaluation, and platinum
accumulation study demonstrated that the cellular uptake of the sugar-conjugates was
regulated by GLUT1. The higher intrinsic DNA reactivity of the sugar-conjugates was
confirmed by kinetic study of platinum(II)-guanosine adduct formation. The mechanistic
origin of the antitumor effect of the fluorine complexes was found to be forming the
bifunctional Pt-guanine-guanine (Pt-GG) intrastrand cross-links with DNA. The results
provide a rationale for Warburg effect targeted anticancer drug design.

become one of the most potent metal-containing drugs
widely used for cancer chemotherapy [1, 2]. Clinical use of
cisplatin helps many patients with different types of cancer,
such as ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck

INTRODUCTION
Since Rosenberg’s discovery of cisplatin, [cis(NH3)2PtCl2] (also known as cis-DDP and CDDP), it has

tumors, achieve better prognosis and enhanced life quality
[3]. However, its poor water solubility and severe side
effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity,
and emetogenesis greatly limit the clinical application [4].
Therefore, improvements to increase solubility and reduce
the toxic side effects have drawn extensive research efforts.
Compared with cisplatin, the second generation platinum
antitumor drug, carboplatin [cis-(NH3)2Pt(CBDC)] (CBDC,
1,1’-cyclobutyldicarboxylate), reduces the toxic side effects
while retaining a similar spectrum of antitumor activity and
high extent of cross-resistance with cisplatin [5]. Oxaliplatin,
a third-generation platinum analog, has shown a wide range
of antitumor activity in metastatic cancer, and shown very
good curative effect in the treatment of colorectal cancer [6].
Besides the aforementioned platinum based antitumor
drugs, thousands of platinum compounds have been
synthesized, and evaluated for their antitumor activity.
Various pioneering drug design strategies are deployed to
synthesize new antitumor platinum derivatives [7, 8]. These
strategies are mainly focused on changing the chelating ligand
or altering the leaving groups of the platinum(II) complexes.
The chelating ligand, also known as neutral ligand, could
substantially avoid resistance, and influence the efficacy as
well as the mechanism of cellular uptake of platinum(II)
derivatives [9]. For example, picoplatin (Figure 1) [10] has
been reported to show low reactivity with glutathione and
improved responses in resistant tumors [11, 12].
Furthermore, structural modification at the leaving
group also modifies the physicochemical properties

(e.g. water solubility and stability) of the complex and
is therefore a promising strategy in drug design [13].
Nedaplatin (Figure 1), containing a glycolate structure
as the leaving group, exhibits improved outcomes over
cisplatin when used in combination with docetaxel in a
phase III trial of advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
of the lung [14]. While most of the molecular modification
and structural design aim at improving therapeutic efficacy
and/or decreasing the side effects, few studies strategically
focus on enhancing tumor selectivity.
Compared to non-transformed tissue, cancerous
tissues exhibit increased glucose consumption and display
high rates of aerobic glycolysis [15, 16]. This glycolysis
enhancement phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect.
One of the most well-known examples of targeting the
Warburg effect is the 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose
(18F-FDG)-based positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging technique, which has been widely and successfully
used in cancer diagnosis and clinical staging [17, 18].
Biological studies demonstrated that abnormal
or impaired glucose homeostasis is not only involved
in diabetes [19, 20], but also in cancers. To achieve
increased glucose consumption, the insulin-independent
glucose transporter GLUT1, is widely overexpressed in
the majority of human cancers [21, 22], which makes
them attractive therapeutic targets. With the aim of
developing a new class of selective tumor-targeting
platinum(II) anticancer agent, our principal interest is to
leverage the GLUT1 mediated selective drug delivery as

an anticancer strategy. Therefore, our design concept is to
increase transportability and intra-tumoral accumulation
of the platinum(II) complexes through glycoconjugation
at the malonato leaving ligand which may help the drug
molecule be recognized by GLUTs (Figure 1). At the same
time, introduce of sugar moiety and fluorine substitution
will largely enhance water solubility of the platinum(II)
complexes and diminish non-selective drug uptake.
GLUT1 is a facilitative sugar transporter and
primarily transport glucose. Galactose, mannose as well
as glucosamine can also be transported by GLUT1 with
distinct efficiencies [23]. Through our previous proofof-concept studies, we established some useful synthetic
and basic biological evaluation methods on different
platinum-glycoconjugates including C1-O-glycosides
[24], 2-deoxy and 6-deoxy-glycoconjugates [25, 26], as
well as developed fluorescent bioprobes as useful tool for
cell-based glucose uptake imaging [27].
In 2013, we reported the first sugar conjugated
oxaliplatin type platinum(II) glycoconjugates with high
water solubility and antitumor activity comparable to nonsugar conjugated oxaliplatin. We found that the fluorine
substitution has a profound effect on water solubility
improvement of the platinum(II) complex [28]. In the
present article, we report the comprehensive biological,
pharmacological and mechanistic studies on a series of
2-flouromalonato-platinum(II) glycoconjugates using
glucose, mannose and galactose as GLUT targeting sugar
motif. For a comparable reason, the same chelating ligand
DACH as of oxaliplatin was adopted in the structure and
all evaluations were performed along with assessments
of oxaliplatin. All complexes were investigated for water
solubility measurement and cytotoxicity analysis in six
different cancer cell lines. The study also revealed, for the
first time, the glucose conjugated platinum(II) complex
5a exhibits superior in vivo efficacy to oxaliplatin at
equimolar dose level (as low as 18% of the MTD for 5a
vs. 90% MTD for oxaliplatin) in mouse ascetic leukemia
model, and at a lower equitoxic dose level in another colon
cancer xenograft model. In order to gain a deeper insight
into the mechanism of action, GLUT mediated cell uptake,
DNA interaction and DNA binding kinetics as Warburg
effect targeting properties of the new compounds were
investigated.

of the reaction for the syntheses is shown in Scheme 1.
The synthesis of the glucose-conjugated (trans-R,Rcyclohexane- 1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II)
complex
(5a),
mannose-conjugated
(trans-R,Rcyclohexane- 1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II)
complex (5b), and galactose-conjugated (trans-R,Rcyclohexane- 1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II)
complex (5c), was accomplished in a five-step sequence
that started with D-glucose, D-mannose and D-galactose
respectively. The corresponding 2-bromoethyl-2,3,4,6tetraacetyl-D-glycoside were prepared according to the
literature method [29, 30], followed by electrophilic
substitution reaction with diethylmalonate through
a two carbon linkers. The introduction of fluorine to
the 2-position of malonic acid was performed using
selectfluor as fluorinating reagent, which could inhibit
the enolization of malonic acid, to increase stability of
the malonatoplatinum complexes and improve the water
solubility on account of fluorine mediated hydrogen
bonding interaction. The sugar conjugated malonic acid
ligand was obtained though hydrolyzation and purified by
preparative HPLC in high yields.
The coupling reactions of sugar conjugated
malonic acid ligand with (trans-R,R-cyclohexane1,2-diamine) sulfatoplatinum(II) afforded previously
described compound 5a [31] and mannose-conjugated
platinum(II) complex 5b and galactose-conjugated
platinum(II) complex 5c in moderate to high yields. All
final platinum(II) complexes 5a, 5b and 5c were obtained
as white solid with a total yield of 58.3%, 70.2% and 69%
for the final step respectively and the purity can reach up
to 98.46% after preparative HPLC purification.
The stereochemistry for compound 5b and 5c were
determined at the stage of sugar conjugated malonic acid
ligands. As illustrated in Figure 3, 1H NMR analysis
with the proton on 1-position of the sugar moiety, and
the mannose derived glycoside was assigned as a pure
α-anomer (4b: δ 4.70 (s, 1H), 600 MHz, D2O) [30]
whereas the galactose derived glycoside was assigned
as a pure β-anomer (4c: δ 4.33 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 600
MHz, D2O)

Water solubility
Poor water solubility and low lipophilicity of
platinum mediated anti-tumor drugs have brought great
inconvenience in clinical application. In the current study,
by introducing the highly polar sugar moiety and the
fluorine as a hydrogen bonding acceptor (which helps the
slvation process) to the structure of platinum complexes,
the water solubility of the drug molecule was considered
can be significantly improved.
The water solubility of sugar conjugated platinum
complexes was determinated and compared to that of
oxaliplatin and cisplatin. As summarized in Table 1,
glycosylation of the platinum complexes dramatically

RESULTS
Chemistry
Three sugar-conjugated (trans-R,R-cyclohexane1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II) complexes
(5a, 5b, 5c) have been synthesized from glucose, mannose
and galactose respectively (Figure 2). The structures of
all three complexes were confirmed by NMR (1H and 13C)
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and high resolution
mass spectra (HRMS, m/z). The schematic presentation

improved the water solubility. Solubility of 5a achieved
946.8 mg/mL, 155 fold higher than oxaliplatin, 946
fold higher than cisplatin. The relatively insignificant
increase was observed for 5c, but it still exhibited 108
times increase compared with oxaliplatin. As compared
with methyl containing platinum(II) glycoconjugates
that we described in our previous research [32], the
fluorine containing platinum(II) glycoconjugates
exhibited even better water solubility. The most obvious
enhancement could be observed from 5b, whose
solubility was improved almost 16 times over the methyl
substituted complex: (trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2diamine)-2-methylmalonatoplatinum(II)-α-D-mannose
conjugate (Man-Me-Pt).

To identify the in vitro anti-cancer activity of
compounds 5a, 5b and 5c, the cytotoxicity of these
complexes in comparison to oxaliplatin was assessed by
means of MTS assay in six human carcinoma cell lines.
The corresponding IC50 values are given in Table 2. Each
complex showed varying cytotoxic profiles. In general, the
range of in vitro cytotoxicity determined for the platinum
sugar conjugates was comparable to oxaliplatin. However,
there is not a correlation between hydrophilic property
of platinum complexes and their cytotoxic effects. 5a
exhibited 2-fold higher activity than oxaliplatin in A549
human lung cancer cell line. In SK-OV-3 epithelial

ovarian cancer cell line, 5b showed higher anti-tumor
efficacy than oxaliplatin, as reflected by up to 70% lower
IC50 values. All three compounds presented effective
anti-tumor activity in lung cancer (H460), as shown by
their IC50 values, which are essentially half of oxaliplatin.
We observed similar results in breast cancer (MCF7),
with the exception of 5c complex, where oxaliplatin

was more active. Although all cell lines responded to all
anti-proliferative complexes, the colon cancer cell line
HT29 was the most sensitive. As depicted in Table 2,
the cytotoxicity of 5a is almost 10-fold higher in HT29
cells than oxaliplatin, whereas the cytotoxic effect of 5c
and 5b was about 5-fold and 2-fold higher respectively.
In addition, to mitigating undesired toxic side effects

associated with chemotherapy, we evaluated the selectivity
of 5a and oxaliplatin using EBAS-2B-CM (human lung
epithelial cells). EBAS-2B-CM cells were exposed to 6.25
μM of oxaliplatin and platinum complex 5a for 72 h. MTS
assay was then conducted to determine the percentage of
the living cells. The results showed that compared with
oxaliplatin, compound 5a didn’t exhibited cytotoxicity
against EBAS-2B-CM cells, indicating lower toxic effects
and better selectivity of 5a betwwen normal and cancer
cells (Supplementary Figure 30).
The mechanisms of cellular cisplatin resistance
which have been investigated to date include the following
components: decreased drug accumulation, increased
drug inactivation, enhanced DNA repair/tolerance, and
conjugation to intracellular thiols like glutathione (GSH)
[33]. Sugar conjugated platinum(II) complexes can cross
cell membrane facilitated by GLUT1 mediated active
transport (see section Cellular uptake mechanism of the
platinum complexes), the leaving ligand (sugar-derived
malonate) will hydrolyzed inside the cell, therefore
forming aquocomplexes and affording the same active
principle as oxaliplatin. On the basis of this hypothesis, we
expect that the current platinum(II) glycoconjugates will
be able to circumvent cross-resistance to cisplatin. The
cytotoxic activities of oxaliplatin and sugar conjugates
were determined in both the cisplatin resistant HT29cisR

cell line and the cisplatin sensitive HT29 human colon
carcinoma cell line. As shown in Figure 4, unlike cisplatin,
the sugar conjugated platinum(II) complexes displayed
high cytotoxicity against human colon HT29cisR cell line,
with IC50 values in the range of 4.78-6.02 μM in contrast
to 19.35 μM of cisplatin.

Cellular uptake mechanism of the platinum
complexes
Many small molecule drugs can diffuse across the
lipid bilayer easily. However, larger and more hydrophilic
molecules cannot pass through the cell membrane by
simple diffusion. These substances can just be transported
by special proteins [34]. Based on this theory and our
design concept, we compared differential GLUT1 protein
expression six cancer cell lines and postulated that the
improved cytotoxicity of water-soluble sugar conjugate
5a was due to the active uptake by GLUT1. GLUT1 was
analyzed by western blotting of whole-cell extracts. Figure
5A revealed that human colon cancer cell line HT29
had the highest expression of GLUT1. Interestingly, the
expression levels correlated with the anti-proliferation
activity against HT29 for all three platinum complexes,
indicating that the transportation of platinum complexes
might be mediated by GLUT1.

* The IC50 value for Cisplatin in HT29 cells was 4.05 ± 0.11 μM. IC50 was evaluated by the MTS assay for 72 h. All
compounds were tested in the same batch and the experiments were performed three times with five replicates. HT29
(human colon cancer cell line), H460 (human lung cancer cell line), DU145 (human prostate cancer cell line), A549 (human
lung carcinoma), SKOV3 (human ovarian cancer cell line), MCF7 (human breast cancer cell line).
To test the hypothesis, we performed the inhibitor
dependent cytotoxicity assay of sugar conjugate 5a and
oxaliplatin by using quercetin as the inhibitor. Human
colon cancer cell line HT29 was chosen for this study
as it showed the highest expression level of GLUT1
protein among all tested cell lines. HT29 cells were
grown in monolayer and were treated with and without
quercetin, followed by exposure to 100 μM of platinum(II)
complexes for 48 h. MTS assay was used to analyze the
cell viability and the effects of GLUT1 inhibitor quercetin
on cytotoxicity. As depicted in Figure 5D, the cell-killing
potency of all three sugar conjugates revealed significant
dependency on quercetin (* P < 0.05). However, under
the same condition, quercetin alone did not exert any
cytotoxic effect.
Similar improvement of the anti-proliferation
activity of platinum complexes was also observed when
GLUT1 expression was down-regulated by short-hairpin
RNAs (shRNA). HT29 cells transfected by empty vector
pLKO.1 (HT29-mock) was used as control. Retroviralmediated gene transduction of shRNA was used to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

generate GLUT1 knockdown clones (HT29-shRNA). To
examine GLUT1 knock-down efficiency, RT-qPCR and
western blot analyses were performed (Figure 5C, 5D and
5E). In consistence with the inhibitory effect of quercetin,
the IC50 values of all three sugar conjugates were strikingly
increased in HT29-shRNA cells, as depicted in Figure 5E.
However, the antitumor efficacy of oxaliplatin showed no
significant difference between HT29-mock and HT29shRNA cells.
Cellular platinum accumulation analysis of
compound 5a was tested in HT29, empty vector
transfected and shGLUT1-transfected cells. After
incubation for 2 hours at 200 μM of 5a, DNA was isolated
and the intracellular platinum accumulation was measured
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The uptake values are depicted in Figure 5H.
Interestingly, the uptake of compound 5a in HT29 and
HT29-mock cells was greater than that in HT29-shRNA1
and HT29-shRNA2 cells, which is also consistent with the
observed cytotoxic activity.

Intrinsic DNA reactivity of the sugar conjugates

activity of the sugar conjugates may be at the DNA
adduct level, a plasmid unwinding assay was performed.
The local untwisting of closed-circular supercoiled DNA
induced by different types of platinum−DNA adducts can
be determined by this assay [36]. In this experiment, gel
electrophoresis was applied to analyze the interaction
between pUC18 plasmid DNA and platinum complexes
for 12 h at 37 °C of pUC18 plasmid DNA with increasing
concentrations of 5a, 5b, 5c, cisplatin and oxaliplatin
ranging from 12.5 to 100 μM. pUC18 plasmid DNA was
initially found to be a mixture consists of supercoiled form
I (the major form) and singly-nicked form II (the minor
form). On agarose gels, supercoiled plasmid DNA (form I)
migrates faster in an electrical field than the nicked circle
(form II). When pUC18 plasmid DNA was treated with
sugar-conjugates, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, the mobility of
supercoiled forms and singly-nicked form plasmid DNA
bands increased and showed concentration dependency.
As illustrated in Figure 6E, the two bands of forms I and
II almost moved at the same rate in all tested compounds
and remained essentially parallel at all concentrations. In
addition, the moving distance of the two bands increased
as the concentration increased, exhibiting concentration
dependency. There exist no significant differences
between these platinum complexes which behaved large
in common with cisplatin.
The change in mobility of plasmid DNA bands
caused by interaction with cisplatin is due to the
platination of the bases by intrastrand bifunctional
GG binding. pUC18 plasmid DNA could be digested
with restriction enzyme BamHI at the specific GG site
to construct linear form III DNA [37]. Figure 6F gives

To further understand the intrinsic reactivity of
our synthesized sugar conjugated platinum complexes
with DNA, the kinetic study of platinum complexes with
5’-Guanosine Monophosphate (5’-GMP) implementing 1H
NMR analysis was performed to mimic the platinum(II)DNA adduct formation. 5’-GMP can coordinate to metal
ions through N1 and N7 atoms, but only bind through the
N7 position at pH 7.2 cause the N1 atom is protonated
(pKa (N1) = 9.3) in this medium [35]. For our sample
system, in which the pH had been adjusted to 7.3, the
coordination of 5’-GMP to platinum occurred via N7
position. The reaction of platinum complexes with 5’
-GMP can be monitored by the typical downfield shift
of H8 proton on 5’-GMP from its free form in 1H NMR
spectrum.
The reactivity of platinum complexes as well
as oxaliplatin (5 mM) towards 5’-GMP (10 mM) was
investigated with a pH of 7.2-7.4 at 37 °C. A 5 mM
solution of the sodium chloride was added to the mixture
to simulate the intracellular environment. As summarized
in Figure 6C and 6D, 5a, 5b and 5c exhibited faster
reactions with nucleophlic base 5’-GMP compared to
oxaliplatin.

DNA modification mechanism analysis
N7 of guanine (G) is the most electron-rich site
among all the DNA’s nucleophilic centers, which the
active [Pt(L)2]2+ species may bind to and form DNA crosslinkage [13]. To assess if the in vitro anti-proliferative

digestion only produced the form III DNA. However,

tolerated dose (mean weight loss < 15%) without causing
major (life-threatening) toxicity (< 15% toxic deaths)
in the study. Both the MTD values of these two mouse
models are nearly 5-fold higher than those of oxaliplatin
(DBA/2: 60 mpk for 5a vs. 10 mpk for oxaliplarin;
BALB/c: 36 mpk for 5a vs. 7 mpk for oxaliplatin). In
our previous work, we conducted a comparison study to
check the survival benefit of 5a over oxaliplatin under
equitoxic conditions (both for 5a and oxaliplatin at 70% of
their MTD dosages). In this work, using L1210 leukemia
bearing DBA/2 mice, we challenged to further reduce the
dosage of 5a to an equal molar level (11 mpk for 5a as of
18% MTD vs. 7 mpk for oxaliplatin as of 70 % MTD).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that the
platinum complexes which exhibit significantly different
water solubility to be compared on an equal molar basis.
As summarized in Figure 7A and 7B, it was found that
treatment of equal molar of 5a still recorded overwhelming
superiority in lifespan and survival rate.

and provide promising targets for anti-cancer drugs [38].
Oxaliplatin has been widely used in clinical application
for the treatment of different types of cancer, such as
colon cancer, urothelial cancer, and breast cancer. It
can achieve better prognosis and improve life quality
[39, 40]. However, it may cause severe side effects
including hyperalgesia, motor dysfunctions and peripheral
neuropathy [4, 41, 42], which partially originated from
a lack of tumor selectivity. With the ever-increasing
number of potential targets, it is imperative to choose
the right target for drug discovery in the development of
target-selective therapeutics [43, 44]. Novel strategies,
such as glycoconjugation, for enhancing tumor-targeting
properties of platinum anti-cancer complexes are of
great interest and become an appealing strategy for
targeted delivery [45, 46]. The radiolabeled glucose
derivative 18F-FDG is a successful representative of
glycoconjugation in tumor diagnosis and is supported
by GLUTs-mediated uptake and selective tumor
accumulation. However, few glycoconjugated anti-cancer
drugs have been synthesized for targeted cancer therapy.
In the current study, a series of sugar conjugated platinum
complexes with specific tumor-targeting properties were
synthesized, and the anti-tumor activities were evaluated.
GLUT1, a member of the mammalian facilitative
glucose transporter family [47, 48], is significantly
overexpressed in many human cancers, for example, nonsmall cell lung cancer [49], breast cancer [50], gastric
carcinoma [51], pancreatic carcinoma [52] and colorectal
cancer [53]. In this research we compared GLUT1 protein
expression in six cancer cell lines, analyzed their different
sensitivity in anti-proliferation activity of sugar conjugates
and raised a hypothesis that the transportation of sugar
conjugated platinum complexes might be mediated by
GLUT1. As summarized in Table 2, the cytotoxicities
of different sugar conjugated platinum(II) complexes
5a, 5b and 5c are exhibited positive correlation with the
expression level of GLUT1 in the most overexpressing
HT29 cell lines. For the lowest GLUT1 expression
MCF-7 cell line, the glucose and mannose conjugated
platinum(II) complexes 5a and 5b still showed high
sensitivities but the galactose conjugated compound 5c
exhibited weaker cytotoxicity. This phenomenone needs
to be further investigated as other subtypes of GLUTs may
overexpressing in MCF-7 cells and 5c may have different
cellular uptake compared to 5a and 5b.
To test the hypothesis, three different assays on
cellular uptake mechanism were performed. Results from
the inhibitor dependent cytotoxicity assay of all three sugar
conjugates and oxaliplatin revealed that the cell-killing
potency of sugar conjugates had significant dependency
on quercetin, whereas oxaliplatin did not exhibit quercetin
dependent cytotoxicity. In consistence with the inhibitory
effect of quercetin, improvement of the IC50 values of
sugar conjugates for anti-tumor activity against HT29
were also observed when GLUT1 expression was down-

In vivo growth inhibition of HT29 xenograft
model
Since complex 5a being the most potent compound
in the series in cytotoxicity against HT29, its in vivo
anticancer activity was examined in HT29 tumor xenograft
BALB/c nude mice model. The dose regimen was set
as: 5a, 25 mg/kg at 70% of its MTD vs. oxaliplatin, 7
mg/kg at 100% of its MTD, with the schedule of qw x 4
and monitored for 51 days. As shown in Figure 7C the
treatment with 5a at 25 mg/kg resulted in statistically
significant tumor shrinkage. The tumor growth inhibition
(TGI) of 5a was greater than that of oxaliplatin. With
regard to the tumor weight change, similar results were
observed (Figure 7E). 5a at a dose of 25 mg/kg caused
significant tumor shrinkage and the reduction in tumor
weight (TGI, 44.68%, * P < 0.05 vs. control group) was
greater than that of oxaliplatin (TGI, 23.01%). Throughout
the treatment period, no signs of toxicity such as distress
or fatigue were observed and there were no significant
difference in body weight change among the vehicle
group, 5a and oxaliplatin-treated groups (Figure 7D). In
addition, 90% maximal tolerated dose of oxaliplatin was
applied in this experiment, whereas 5a was applied at 70%
maximal tolerated dose. These observations collectively
suggest 5a strongly inhibits tumorigenesis in colon cancer
xenografts in vivo, even at a relatively low dose.

DISCUSSION
The rapid growth of cancer cells demands large
amounts of glucose and drastic increases in glucose
metabolite flux. Today this phenomenon is known as
the “Warburg effect” and is one of the hall marks of
cancer [16]. The altered glucose metabolism and glucose
transporter overexpression are common in cancer cells

regulated by short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA). However, the
anti-tumor efficacy of oxaliplatin showed no significant
difference between HT29-mock and HT29-shRNA
cells. To further confirm our hypothesis, the intracellular
platinum accumulation assay was performed. As expected,
the platinum uptake of compound 5a in HT29 and HT29mock cells was greater than that in HT29-shRNA cells.
Based on the results, both RNAi knockdown and the
inhibitor blockade of the GLUT1 resulted in decreased

cytotoxicity and decreased intracellular platinum
accumulation in HT29 cell line, suggesting that the sugar
conjugates was transported mainly via GLUT1 and all
three sugars as glycoconjugation motif have similar effect
to enable the platinum(II) complexes as substrate for
GLUT1 mediated tumor targeting.
With the aim to understand the intrinsic reactivity
of the interactions of platinum complexes with N-bonding
ligands, we investigated the complex-formation

kinetics of 5a, 5b, 5c with nitrogen donor ligands 5’GMP implementing 1H NMR analysis to mimic the
Pt(II)-DNA adduct formation and compared to that of
oxaliplatin. It is well known that 5’-GMP can coordinate
to metal ions through the N1 and N7 positions, but only
bind through the N7 position in a neutral medium [35].
Therefore, nucleophilic substitution reaction with 5’GMP occurs at the N7 atom of purine base. Downfield
shift of H8 proton on 5’-GMP from hydrogen spectrum
can be used to monitor the newly formed platinum(II)GMP complex. Our 5’-GMP consumption kinetics results
indicated that 5a, 5b and 5c exhibited faster reactions with
nucleophlic base 5’-GMP compared to oxaliplatin. The
intrinsic reactivity investigation from 5’-GMP reaction
kinetics study demonstrated that the 2-flouromalonatoplatinum(II) glycoconjugates derived from glucose,
mannose and galactose as alternative sugar motif have
greater apoptotic potential compared to oxaliplatin.
Researches on mechanism of cisplatin and oxaliplatin
have revealed that platinum-DNA adduct formation based
on intrastrand or interstrand chelation involving two
adjacent guanines, interferes with cell division, replication
and triggers apoptosis [54, 55]. It has been reported that
cisplatin and oxaliplatin form approximately 60–65%
intrastrand adducts at the GG sites on the DNA [6, 56,
57]. The intrastrand crosslinks to d(GpG) is the most
abundant species in cisplatin-damaged DNA. Agarose gel
electrophoresis was used to investigate the ability of sugar
conjugates to bind and unwind DNA from the supercoiled
form of pUC18 plasmid DNA to the open circular or linear
forms. Results from DNA unwinding assay indicated
that when pUC18 plasmid DNA was treated with sugar
conjugates, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, the mobility of
supercoiled forms and open circular form plasmid DNA
bands increased and showed concentration dependency.
The change in mobility of pUC18 plasmid DNA bands
caused by sugar conjugated platinum complexes is
believed to be due to interstrand binding to the GG sites
of DNA. pUC18 plasmid DNA could be digested with
restriction enzyme BamHI at the specific GG site to
construct linear form III DNA [37]. All concentrations
of the compounds prevented BamHI digestion in varying
degrees. The prevention of BamH1 digestion showed
correlation with the increasing concentration of platinum
complexes. The interaction observed for the platinum(II)sugar conjugates with plasmid (pUC18) DNA, along with
the BamHI digestion of the mixtures point to the formation
of Pt-GG intrastrand DNA binding adducts, which is
similar to that of oxaliplatin.
Compared with oxaliplatin, compound 5a showed an
improved potency and safety profiles in ascetic leukemia
L1210 bearing DBA/2 mice model. Unlike our previous
work [24], in which compound 5a and oxaliplatin were
administered at the equitoxic doses of 70% of MTD. In
this work, a reduced dose of 18% MTD of 5a (11 mg/kg),
which is equal molar with oxaliplatin (7 mg/kg), was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

administered in ascetic leukemia L1210 bearing DBA/2
mice model. With regard to its anti-leukemic activity,
compound 5a was still able to extend the mean life span,
indicating improved safety on anti-leukemic efficacy. In
addition, compound 5a suppresses tumor growth in HT29
colon cancer xenografts mice model. Compared to the
vehicle-treated control animals, experimental animals
treated with compound 5a resulted in a clear suppression
of tumor growth. As compared with oxaliplatin,
significant suppress on tumor growth inhibition (TGI)
and tumor weight of 5a was observed. In addition, 100%
maximal tolerated dose of oxaliplatin was applied in this
experiment, whereas 5a was applied at 70% maximal
tolerated dose. These results indicated that 5a was even
more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in the HT29
xenograft mouse models than oxaliplatin, which were
associated with a significant reduction in colon cancer cell
proliferation.
In summary, based on Warburg effect tumor
targeting strategy, a series of fluorine substituted
platinum(II)-sugar conjugates were designed and
synthesized to leverage the GLUT-mediated tumor
specific drug uptake. The introduction of fluorine and
sugar moiety in the malonato leaving ligand tremendously
improved water solubility of the platinum(II) complexes.
In addition to the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity
evaluations, we systematically revealed the cellular
transport mechanism of the sugar conjugated fluorine
containing platinum complexes by utilizing different
assessment strategies. Recent studies have demonstrated
the drug-induced neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin are due to its
drug uptake mechanism with certain type of transporters
such as organic cation transporters (OCTs), which are
ubiquitously expressed in normal cells and neuron
system [58–60]. Compare with oxaliplatin, the glucose,
mannose and galactose conjugated highly water soluble
(trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonatoplatinum(II) complexes exhibited not only comparable or
better in vitro cytotoxicities, but also improved potency
and safety in both the L1210 bearing ascitic leukemia
and human colon cancer xenograft animal models. These
results provide evidences and prove the advantages for
glucose transporter mediated tumor specific drug delivery
and the Warburg effect mediated tumor targeting. Both in
vitro and in vivo results from the current proof-of-concept
study support that the glucose conjugated compound 5a
has great potential for further pre-clinical evaluations as
Warburg effect targeted anticancer agent.

environment under a condition of constant photoperiod.
Experiments were carried out at the Institute of
Biomedical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences (Tianjin, China) and the experimental
procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee and
Animal Care Committee of the Institute. Six mice for
treatment groups and ten mice for control group were
used for this in vivo study. L1210 murine leukemia cells
(1 × 106) were injected intraperitoneally into DBA/2 mice
on day 0. Both 5a and oxalilplatin dissolved in deionized
water under ultrasound for 15 min just before use. The
drug solutions were administered intraperitoneally at
concentrations of 11 mg/kg for 5a (equal molar to that
of oxaliplatin, 18% MTD) and 7 mg/kg for oxaliplatin
(70% MTD) on days 1, 5, and 9. Control group of ten
mice each received injections of sterile saline. Animals
were observed daily for clinical signs of toxicity and
body weight was measured throughout the study. Survival
times of experimental mice were recorded to evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of 5a and oxalilplatin since the day
after tumor cell injection and compared to that of control
animals over a period of 7 weeks.

100mM NaCl) was prepared as negative control. After the
incubation period, drug-DNA mixtures were loaded onto
0.8% agarose gel and electrophoresis was performed in
Tris-acetate/EDTA buffer (TAE) for 1.5 h at 80 V. The gel
was stained with GelRedTM nucleic acid dye, visualized
and photographed on the Bio-Rad Trans illuminator IEC
1010 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

BamHI digestion
pUC18 contains a single restriction site (G/
GATCC) which BamHI could recognize and hydrolyze the
phosphodiester bond between the adjacent guanine sites.
The restriction enzyme digestion of pUC18 DNA with
BamHI can lead to the conversion of supercoiled form I
and singly-nicked form II DNA to linear form III DNA.
In this experiment, a set of drug-DNA mixtures obtained
from the experiment described above was then subjected
to BamHI (20 units/μL) digestion. To the solution of drug–
DNA mixtures was added 2 μL of 10× digestion buffer
(Cutsmart) followed by the addition of 0.1 μL BamHI (2
units). The mixtures were incubated in water bath at 37°C
for 2 h. The gel was stained with GelRedTM nucleic acid

Anticancer activity against HT29 cells in vivo
Female BALB/c nude mice were inoculated by
subcutaneous injection of HT29 human colon cancer cells (5
× 106). For the treatment groups, drug dosage was adjusted
for average body weight for each group. Injection volume
was 10 mL/kg. Each treatment group contains eight mice
and control animals used ten mice and received injections
of sterile saline. Treatments were initiated when the tumor
reached a volume of 100-300 mm3 in all mice. Animals
received multiple treatments intravenously on days 0, 7,
14 and 21. Oxaliplatin and 5a were administered at the
dose of 7 mg/kg (100% of MTD) and 25 mg/kg (70% of
39493

Oncotarget

MTD) respectively. Saline (5% v/v) was administered to the
vehicle control group. Tumor volume was assessed regularly
by measuring length (l) and width (w) with caliper and
calculated using the formula V = lw2/2. Body weight was
recorded and used as a parameter of systemic toxicity. All
mice were sacrificed on the 46th day of the experiment, and
the tumor weight was measured.
