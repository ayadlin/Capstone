ABSTRACT
Despite numerous studies involving patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, few
studies have investigated the relationship between the ability of the tumor to engraft
(tumorigenicity) and the clinical features of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this
study was to determine whether tumorigenicity correlates with clinical outcomes of
CRC patients. We included 241 CRC patients who underwent radical surgery from 2010
to 2013. PDX models were established by implanting tumor fragments obtained from
these patients into the subcutaneous layer of immunodeficient mice. Xenografts were
successfully established from 62.2%. Successful engraftment was associated with
advanced stage (p < 0.001) and moderate/poor differentiation (p = 0.029). Threeyear disease-free survival (DFS) rates were lower for patients with tumorigenicity
(p = 0.011). In stage III patients, tumorigenicity was an independent predictor of
poor DFS (p = 0.034). In addition, mutation of TP53 was most frequently detected
in stage III patients with tumorigenicity. Two models of stage IV disease without
KRAS mutations showed high sensitivity to EGFR-targeted agents, while none of the
models with KRAS mutations showed high sensitivity. In conclusion, PDX models
may provide an effective preclinical tool for predicting cancer progression and could
be used to further genomic and pharmacologic research on personalized treatments.

INTRODUCTION

patients during the course of disease [6, 7]. Surgical
resection combined with systemic chemotherapy has
improved survival rates in colorectal cancer, but treatment
outcomes in patients whose disease has progressed remain
unsatisfactory. Newer targeted agents such as cetuximab
and panitumumab are widely used to treat metastatic
colorectal cancer [8, 9]. However, some patients do not
respond to these targeted therapies [10], indicating the
need to develop personalized treatments for these patients.
Numerous molecular investigations have been

Colorectal cancer is the third most common
malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide [1-4]. Early diagnosis and treatment have
improved survival of colorectal cancer, but the mortality
rate is still the fourth highest in males and third highest in
females [4, 5]. This high mortality rate is due to recurrence
and metastasis, which occur in approximately 50% of

carried out to develop personalized treatments [11],
requiring models that accurately represent the biologic
characteristics of the individual patient. Such preclinical
studies have used cancer cell lines or patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models [10, 12]. Although cell lines are
practical and easy to manipulate, they generally show
poorly differentiated histology and lack similarity to
the original tumor [13, 14], whereas PDX models better
reflect characteristics of the original tumor, including
tumor heterogeneity [12, 13]. As a result, PDX models
have been widely used to develop treatment strategies for
patients with refractory cancer. However, not all tumors
specimens from cancer patients engraft successfully in
animal models, and this difference may be associated with
the progressiveness of the original tumor. Despite the
increased use of PDX models, few studies have reported
the relationship between engraftment of tumor specimens
and clinical features of patients with colorectal cancer.
This relationship may be useful in the interpretation of
results in preclinical studies using PDX models. Therefore,
in this study we evaluated the relationship between tumor
engraftment in PDX models and clinical outcomes in
patients with colorectal cancer.

not significant (p = 0.456).

Clinical outcomes and tumorigenicity
To better understand the relationship between PDX
tumorigenicity and clinical outcomes, we analyzed the
DFS of patients according to tumorigenicity. Median
follow-up was 22.9 months (range, 0.2–51.3), and there
were 58 recurrences and three deaths. The 3-year DFS
rate of patients whose tumors successfully engrafted in the
PDX model was significantly lower than that of patients
whose tumors failed to engraft (56.1% vs. 81.5%, p =
0.011) (Figure 1A).
Further analysis of 3-year DFS rates according to
cancer stage showed no significant difference between
patients with stage I–II cancer whose tumors failed to
engraft and those whose tumors successfully engrafted
(89.5% vs. 91.5%, respectively, p = 0.861) (Figure 1B).
However, 3-year DFS was significantly lower for patients
with stage III cancer whose tumors engrafted in the
PDX model compared with those whose tumors failed to
engraft (56.5% vs. 91.1%, p = 0.012) (Figure 1C). Results
of multivariate analysis revealed that tumorigenicity in
the PDX model (HR, 4.966; 95% CI, 1.126–21.905; p =
0.034) and old age (HR, 0.027; 95% CI, 1.178–14.600; p
= 0.027) were independent predictors of DFS in patients
with stage III cancer (Table 2). In patients with stage IV
cancer, 3-year DFS appeared to be lower for patients
whose tumors engrafted compared with those whose
tumors failed to engraft (30.4% vs. 42.4%); however,
this difference was not significant (p = 0.842) (Figure
2A). Similar results were obtained for the corresponding
50 liver metastatic lesions (32.3% vs. 56.3%, p = 0.911)
(Figure 2B).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and tumorigenicity
Of the 241 patients with colorectal cancer, 135
were male and 106 were female. Median age was 59.9
years (range, 24–89). Patients were classified according
to cancer stage: stage I (n = 15), stage II (n = 72), stage
III (n = 84), and stage IV (n = 70). In patients with stage
IV cancer, sites of metastasis included the liver (n = 61),
distant lymph nodes (n = 4), lung (n = 3), ovary (n = 1),
and peritoneum (n = 1).
Of the 241 tumor specimens, 150 (62.2%)
successfully engrafted, reaching a size of 1,000 mm3
in 90 ± 20 days. The remaining 91 tumor specimens
(37.8%) failed to engraft. Tumorigenicity according to
patient characteristics is shown in Table 1. Tumor take
rates were significantly higher for more advanced stage
primary tumors (p < 0.001), with xenografts established
from four of 15 (26.7%) stage I tumors, 41 of 72 (56.9%)
stage II tumors, 50 of 84 (59.5%) stage III tumors, and
55 of 70 (78.6%) stage IV tumors. Tumor take rates were
significantly higher for moderately differentiated (66.5%)
and poorly differentiated (66.7%) tumors compared with
well-differentiated tumors (46.7%, p = 0.029).
Among the 70 patients with stage IV tumors, 50
PDX models were established using paired xenografts
from primary and metastatic liver tumors. Tumorigenicity
appeared to be higher for metastatic lesions than for
primary tumors (84.0% vs. 78.6%), but this difference was

Somatic DNA mutations of primary tumors with
tumorigenicity
To investigate the mutational status of patients
with tumorigenicity, we performed genomic profiling
for successfully engrafted samples of primary tumor. We
selected five tumor samples from patients with stage III
disease, and analyzed the somatic DNA mutations of eight
genes selected for their importance in colorectal cancer
(Table 3). Nonsense and missense mutations were shown,
where three of the five samples (60%) had transcription
stop-gaining APC point mutations and four samples had
TP53 point mutations (80%, one transcription stop-gaining
mutation and four missense mutations). The mutation
frequency of each gene was compared to that from 272
stage I-IV colon adenocarcinoma samples in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The five samples from our study
did not demonstrate KRAS mutation (0%), while 36%
of TCGA samples had KRAS mutations. Four samples
exhibited TP53 mutations (80%), while only 50% of

TCGA samples had TP53 mutations. Even though the
differences in mutation frequencies were not statistically
significant due to the small sample size, further genomic
profiling in future studies could elucidate these differences.

None of the models with somatic KRAS mutations
showed high sensitivity to the EGFR-targeted agents.
Clearer correlation between the genomic profile of EGFRsignaling genes and responsiveness to EGFR targeted
treatments can be shown with further enriched genomic
profiles in the future.

Drug sensitivity to EGFR-targeted agents for
PDX tumors

DISCUSSION

To investigate responsiveness to epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents according to
mutation of EGFR-signaling genes, we performed
genomic profiling for PDX tumors and drug sensitivity
assay. Thirteen PDX models from nine patients with
stage IV disease were selected for drug sensitivity
testing. Somatic DNA mutations of selected genes, which
either had known importance in colorectal cancer or
belonged to the EGFR signaling pathway, were identified.
Sensitivities to EGFR-targeted agents are presented for
each model (Table 4). Nonsense and missense mutations
are also presented, where two of 13 models showed high
sensitivity to the EGFR-targeted agents, and both models
belonged to the group without somatic KRAS mutations.

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between
successful tumor engraftment in PDX models and the
clinical features of patients with colorectal cancer. Similar
to the results of previous studies [10, 15], xenografts
were successfully established with 62.2% of the primary
tumors. Successful engraftment of the primary tumors was
associated with advanced cancer stage and moderately/
poorly differentiation. Primary tumor engraftment also
appeared to be associated with higher preoperative
carcinoembryonic antigen levels, vascular or lymphatic
invasion, and microsatellite instability. For patients with
stage IV cancer, the rate of engraftment was higher for
metastatic lesions than for primary lesions. These results

suggest that colorectal cancers with more aggressive
features are better able to engraft than less aggressive
cancers. In our study, 3-year DFS rates were lower for
patients whose tumors successfully engrafted in the PDX
model compared with patients whose tumors failed to
engraft. However, when these patients were classified
by cancer stage, stage III cancer showed a significant
association between tumor engraftment and decreased
DFS. In addition, tumorigenicity was found to be an
independent predictor of DFS in stage III cancer. These
findings suggest that patients with stage III cancer whose
tumors successfully engraft in PDX models have an
increased risk of relapse.
Few studies have evaluated the relationship between
successful tumor engraftment in a PDX model and clinical
outcomes in colorectal cancer [10, 12]. In a previous
study to evaluate drug-response and tumor progression
using 32 PDX models, tumor take rates were higher for
poorly differentiated tumors and tumors from patients
with lymph node invasion; however, survival did not
differ among patient groups [12]. In another study, the
authors compared tumor take rates of primary (n = 58)
and metastatic (n = 27) lesions, reporting higher tumor
take rates for metastatic lesions; however, this difference
was not significant [10]. In our study, which analyzed a
larger sample size than previous studies, we evaluated
the relationships between tumor engraftment in the PDX
model and patient characteristics and DFS. Similar studies
have been carried out for non-small cell lung cancer,
breast cancer, and uveal melanoma [11, 14, 16, 17].
John et al. reported that tumorigenicity correlated with
the presence of KRAS mutations, poor differentiation,
and larger tumor size in non-small cell lung cancer. In
addition, tumorigenicity was an independent predictor of
shorter DFS [14]. In contrast, Anderson et al. reported that

tumorigenicity did not correlate with clinical outcomes in
non-small cell lung cancer [16].
Cancer cell lines and PDX models have been
widely used in the development of personalized cancer
treatments. Xenografts derived from cell lines are
reproducible, easy to manipulate, and well characterized;
however, they do not exhibit tumor heterogeneity or
the histopathologic and genetic characteristics of the
tumor [8, 13, 14]. Numerous genomic mutations have
been detected in patients with cancer, and high levels of
oncogene mutation can accelerate the growth of tumors
[18, 19]. In our study, we performed genomic profiling
for primary tumor cells from patients whose tumors were
successfully engrafted in the PDX models. We detected
several mutations of colorectal cancer-related genes,
and mutation of TP53 was the most frequently detected.
According to several reports, PDX models better reflect
the genetic diversity of the original tumor, and better
predict clinical tumor response to new therapeutics [8, 12,
13, 20, 21]. Drug sensitivity assay with genomic profiling
using PDX models can provide more information about
primary tumors and new therapeutic strategies for patients,
especially those with disease refractory to conventional
treatments. In this study, we investigated somatic DNA
mutations and accompanying sensitivity to EGFR-targeted
agents in PDX models derived from patients with stage
IV disease. Initial genomic profiling of PDX models
and evaluation of EGFR-targeted treatments showed
selective responsiveness depending on KRAS mutation.
This is consistent with previous studies indicating that
the mutation of EGFR-downstream KRAS can increase
resistance to EGFR-targeted treatments [22-24]. However,
responsiveness to EGFR-targeted agents can depend on
several other factors not addressed in this study, which
include DNA copy number changes, methylation status,

and gene/protein expression levels. Available genomic
profiles along with correlated drug response information
significantly increases the applicability of PDX models,
and further research is needed to complete the genomic
and drug-response profiles of our PDX models.
PDX models are important for the development of
novel treatments, especially for patients with refractory
cancer, indicating the need for well-characterized
xenograft models. In this study, our models stably
established and we found that successful engraftment of
patient-derived colorectal cancer cells correlates with more
aggressive characteristics and worse outcomes. Therefore
PDX models may provide an effective preclinical tool to
evaluate cancer progression and treatment strategies. In
addition, these models can be used for further genomic
and pharmacologic studies to personalized treatments.
Our results provide evidence that PDX models are
applicable to colorectal cancer patients with a progressive
disease course and high risk of relapse. We anticipate that
personalized treatments using PDX models will improve
survival rates for these patients.
In conclusion, our findings show that the successful
engraftment of colorectal cancer tumors in PDX models
is associated with more aggressive disease and worse
clinical outcomes. Our PDX models maybe useful to
predict disease progression in preclinical studies for
personalized medicine and to improve clinical outcomes of
patients. Further studies for genomic and pharmacologic
information will provide novel treatments for patients with
colorectal cancer.

cut into 5- to 10-mm3 pieces, some of which were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at –80°C
or in liquid nitrogen for molecular analysis. Two pieces
were fixed in formalin solution and paraffin-embedded
for histopathologic analysis, and two pieces were
coated in high concentration Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Erembodegem, Belgium) and implanted in 6- to 8-weekold female Balb/c nude mice (Orient Bio, Seongnam,
Korea). A similar process of sample preservation was
carried out for tumor tissues collected from mice.

Establishment of PDXs
Establishment of PDXs was performed as previously
described [8]. Briefly, Matrigel-embedded tumor
fragments (1–2 mm3) were implanted into subcutaneous
pockets made in each side of the lower back. Tumors
that reached a volume of 1,000 mm3 were considered
tumorigenic. All animal experiments were carried out
according to protocols approved by the appropriate
institutional review boards of the Samsung Medical Center
(K-B2-036) and conducted in accordance with the Institute
for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.

Genomic profiling of patients and PDX tumors
Liquid nitrogen-preserved samples from patients
and PDXs were mechanically dissociated and genomic
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Agilent Sureselect Human All
Exome Kit v4 was used to capture the exon region from
DNA. To obtain DNA for patients’ normal control blood
cells, data from raw sequencing reads was produced by
Illumina HiSeqTM2500. To obtain the DNA of tumor
tissues from patients and PDXs, raw sequencing reads
were produced by Illumina HiSeqTM2000. This resulted in
mean coverage rates in the exome region of around 120x
for the tumor tissues and around 80x for normal blood
cells. Somatic mutations in tumor DNA were identified
using the next generation sequencing (NGS) pipeline at
Samsung Genome Institute, Seoul, Korea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was approved by the Samsung Medical
Center Institutional Review Board (no. 2010-04004).
A total of 241 patients with colorectal cancer who
underwent surgery from March 2010 to April 2013 at
the Samsung Medical Center were included. All patients
had histologically confirmed primary adenocarcinoma
and underwent radical surgery for the primary tumor and
synchronous metastatic lesions. Patients who underwent
palliative operations and those with recurrent disease or
synchronous malignancies were excluded.

Drug sensitivity assay of PDX tumors
Dissociated tumor cells from PDXs were grown
in modified neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) containing N2 supplement (Invitrogen), bFGF (20 ng/
ml, Invitrogen), and EGF (50 ng/ml, Invitrogen). Tumor
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1,000 cells per well,
and treated with EGFR-targeted agents (Selleckchem,
Houston, TX, USA) - AEE788, Afatinib, BMS-599626,
Canertinib, CO-1686, Dacomitinib, Erlotinib, Gefitinib,
Lapatinib, Neratinib - under seven-point serial dilution

Tumor samples
Specimens from primary and metastatic tumors
were obtained from patients who had provided written
informed consent. Tumor tissues not required for clinical
diagnosis were placed in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) medium supplemented with 250 U/ml penicillin
and 250 µg/ml streptomycin. Each tumor sample was

concentrations up to 20 µM (n = 3 for each condition).
After three days of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2
humidified incubator, cell viability was analyzed using the
metabolic conversion of a water-soluble tetrazolium salt,
WST-1 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Plates were analyzed
with a spectrophotometer at 450 nm, with a reference
wavelength of 630 nm. For each drug-sample pair, the
drug response curve was approximated using GraphPad
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA)
based on the measured cell viabilities from varying drug
concentrations.

The tumor take rates of primary tumor specimens
were analyzed according to patient characteristics. In
addition, patients were grouped according to cancer stage,
and survival rates of each group were analyzed according
to tumorigenicity (i.e., tumor engraftment in the PDX
