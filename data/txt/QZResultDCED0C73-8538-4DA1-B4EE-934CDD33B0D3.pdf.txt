Early Cytogenetic and Molecular Response
During First-Line Treatment of Chronic
Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase
Long-Term Implications
Alfonso Quintás-Cardama, MD; Jorgé E. Cortes, MD; and Hagop M. Kantarjian, MD

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) depends on the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. This dependency has
led to the development of BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, which have proved to be
highly efficacious treatments for CML. The European LeukemiaNet guidelines have established the importance of
achieving a certain depth of response at different time points during imatinib therapy for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. Patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic response by 12 months or a major molecular response by 18 months are classified as optimal responders and deemed to have excellent long-term outcomes.
Conversely, failing to achieve such milestones is associated with an increased risk of worse long-term outcomes, such
as loss of response, disease progression, or death. With ongoing treatment, patients not in complete cytogenetic
response face a decreasing probability of ever achieving a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular
response and increasing risk of disease progression. Available data therefore support treatment recommendations
based on achieving defined levels of response within a specified duration of treatment. Recent data have shown that
dasatinib and nilotinib used as frontline CML therapy result in higher response rates that are achieved at earlier time
points compared with standard-dose imatinib therapy. Future analyses will need to determine whether these higher

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant hematologic disorder in which clonal expansion of leukemic stem
cells depends on constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. BCR-ABL1 is a fusion protein encoded in most
patients by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), formed by reciprocal translocations between chromosomes 9 and 22.1
Almost 10 years ago, CML therapy was radically changed by the introduction of imatinib (formerly STI571), a
BCR-ABL1–targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).2-4 Imatinib 400 mg once daily became rapidly established as the
preferred first-line therapy for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) after showing superior efficacy and safety compared with interferon-a (IFNa) plus cytarabine, the previous standard of care.3 This was demonstrated in the pivotal IRIS (International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571) trial, in which the cumulative rate
of complete cytogenetic response (complete cytogenetic response; ie, 0% Phþ metaphase cells in bone marrow) was 69%
by 12 months.5 Major molecular response rates were also calculated, that is, the proportion of patients who had a 3-log
reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript level (0.1% ratio) compared with a standardized baseline (established in 3 laboratories
as the median BCR-ABL1 level among 30 trial participants before treatment). Major molecular response rates were significantly better for imatinib compared with IFNa (estimated 12-month major molecular response rates: 39% vs 2% in the
control arm; P < .001).5 Imatinib was associated with a superior rate of transformation-free survival, that is, survival
without progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) (97% vs 91% for IFNa plus cytarabine at 19 months;

P < .001).3 On the basis of the predictive importance of
complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response
observed in the IRIS trial, these have become important
milestones in patients with CML-CP receiving TKI therapy.4,6 The definition of an optimal response to first-line
imatinib, as published by the European LeukemiaNet,
includes complete cytogenetic response by 12 months and
major molecular response by 18 months (Table 1).6
Several different methods exist for assessing cytogenetic or molecular responses, potentially complicating
comparisons of data from different institutions. Conventional cytogenetic testing of bone marrow aspirates is performed by assessing Ph positivity in at least 20 Giemsastained metaphase cells. In patients who have not achieved
a complete cytogenetic response, the degree of cytogenetic
response is classified as partial (1%-35% Phþ metaphases), minor (36%-65% Phþ metaphases), or minimal
(66%-95% Phþ metaphases). A more sensitive detection
method uses fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to
assess the Ph chromosome in peripheral blood interphase
cells, thereby evaluating a higher number of cells than
conventional cytogenetic testing. Parallel analyses of
patients with CML using conventional analysis, interphase or metaphase FISH, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR) have found a high,
albeit not perfect, degree of correlation between BCRABL1 transcript level and cytogenetic assessments.7
A recent study by the GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano
Malattie Ematologiche Adulto) CML Working Party
examined how closely interphase FISH and RT-Q-PCR
correlated with conventional cytogenetic testing. Of
patients defined as having a complete cytogenetic response
using conventional testing, the majority (83%) had <1%

5262

of nuclei positive for BCR-ABL1 in interphase FISH analysis, which is broadly accepted as a false-positive threshold
with modern dual-color dual-fusion FISH probes. Of
patients who had <1% positive nuclei by interphase FISH,
98% had a complete cytogenetic response using conventional chromosome banding analysis. Major molecular
response rates were significantly higher in patients with
<1% positivity by interphase FISH compared with
patients with positivity rates of 1% to 5% (67% vs 52%, P
< .001). These data show that interphase FISH is more
sensitive than conventional cytogenetics and may potentially be useful for monitoring patients who have achieved
complete cytogenetic response by conventional cytogenetic
analysis.8 However, because established response categories
are based on conventional cytogenetics and because FISH
does not detect other clonal chromosomal abnormalities,
conventional testing remains the recommended approach
for establishing complete cytogenetic response. FISH is recommended for identifying the minority of patients with
CML who have Ph BCR-ABL1–positive disease.4,9
In molecular monitoring, the level of BCR-ABL1
transcripts is calculated by normalizing the absolute value
obtained by RT-PCR to that of a housekeeping gene.
However, the choice of housekeeping gene varies between
laboratories and includes ABL1, BCR, GUS, G6PDH, and
b2M, which complicates interlaboratory comparisons.10
Efforts are ongoing to standardize molecular responses
derived in different laboratories using an International
Scale, which uses ABL1 as the housekeeping gene.10,11
Expressing quantitative RT-PCR values on the International Scale using an individual conversion factor unique
to each laboratory may facilitate comparisons of molecular response data.

Response in CML-CP/Quintás-Cardama et al

The current focus on complete cytogenetic response
and major molecular response for evaluating patients is
based on the finding that these responses are predictors of
how patients are likely to fare during long-term treatment.
This has been demonstrated in the IRIS trial, in which
patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic response
had a lower annual incidence of events (loss of response,
transformation to AP/BP, or death) than the overall group
after 5 years of follow-up.12 With 8-year follow-up, no
patient who had complete cytogenetic response and major
molecular response at 12 months had progressed to AP or
BP.13 Importantly, achievement of complete cytogenetic
response has been associated with improved survival,
whereas achievement of major molecular response has
been associated with improved probability of event-free
survival (EFS) but not overall survival (OS).
The importance of complete cytogenetic response
has been further illustrated by IRIS data showing that
achieving a complete cytogenetic response on imatinib
(unlike on IFNa plus cytarabine) enabled patients to overcome the poorer prognosis associated with an intermediate or high Sokal score. The Sokal score is an established
prognostic method in newly diagnosed CML-CP that
uses 4 baseline factors (age, spleen size, platelet count, and
percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood).14 Although
low, intermediate, and high Sokal scores were predictive
for 5-year rates of complete cytogenetic response (89% vs
82% vs 69%, respectively; P < .001) and transformation
to AP/BP (3% vs 8% vs 17%; P ¼ .002) in the imatinib
arm of IRIS, patients within the different Sokal groups
who achieved a complete cytogenetic response had similar
rates of transformation-free survival (95% vs 95% vs
99%, respectively).12 The Hasford risk score is an alternative prognostic system that includes percentages of eosinophils and basophils in addition to the variables used by the
Sokal method when deriving risk score.15 In general, the
Hasford method categorizes fewer patients as high risk
compared with the Sokal method.3 Although Hasford
scores have similar prognostic value to Sokal scores, it has
not been formally confirmed that achieving a complete
cytogenetic response also overcomes a high/intermediate
Hasford categorization.
Recently, initial data have been reported from trials
of the more potent BCR-ABL1 inhibitors dasatinib and
nilotinib compared with imatinib as first-line treatment
for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP.16,17 In both
trials, the newer agents showed superior efficacy over imatinib, although follow-up is currently relatively short (1824 months). A key question is whether these early data

will translate into superior long-term outcomes. In the remainder of this article, analyses from various sources
investigating the predictive value of early responses to
first-line imatinib treatment are reviewed, and the implications of emerging data with newer agents are discussed.

Predicting Long-Term Outcomes Using Early
Responses to First-Line Imatinib Therapy
The use of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response as milestones for treatment response is
based on various landmark analyses that have been performed using data from the IRIS trial and other studies of
first-line imatinib. Landmark analyses are performed by
grouping patients according to their response status at a
specific time point during treatment, then evaluating subsequent outcome in each group typically using the KaplanMeier method. To avoid statistical bias, patients who discontinue treatment before the chosen landmark or who are
not assessed at (or close to) the landmark are excluded
from the analysis.18,19 However, it is worth emphasizing
that landmark analyses are often performed as post hoc or
exploratory analyses. Although the P values reported provide a description of any difference in outcome, they do
not account for multiplicity of analysis and so do not provide an accurate indication of statistical significance. Also,
when performing landmark analyses, patients who are lost
before the chosen time point are discarded, thus the best
patients for the analyses are always selected.
Different types of long-term outcome have been
considered during landmark analyses of imatinib treatment, which is an important consideration when interpreting findings. Although OS is ultimately the most
important outcome, the prolonged survival of patients
with CML-CP in the TKI era means that very long periods of follow-up may be needed before significant differences in survival become apparent. Alternative endpoints,
including progression-free survival (PFS), transformation-free survival, and EFS, are frequently used (almost
interchangeably) when referring to long-term outcomes
in studies of patients with CML-CP, although it is important to note the precise definition used in each study or
analysis. Because transformation to AP or BP is associated
with decreased survival,20 transformation-free survival (ie,
survival without progression to AP/BP) is a commonly
used and important endpoint. In some analyses, time to
progression to AP or BP (ie, distinct from transformationfree survival because death is not considered) has been
reported. EFS was defined in the IRIS trial as survival

without transformation to AP/BP, loss of complete hematologic or major cytogenetic response, or increasing white
cell count while on TKI therapy.3,12 Thus, discontinuation of TKI therapy for toxicity or for other reasons is not
considered an event (15%-20% of patients); patients are
censored at the time of discontinuing TKI therapy, and
their subsequent outcome is not captured, except in the
event of death. Because loss of response typically precedes
disease transformation, and patients who experience hematologic or cytogenetic relapse after an initial response
have lower rates of survival or progression to AP/BP,21-23
EFS is potentially a more sensitive endpoint than transformation-free survival. Confusingly, EFS was called PFS in
early reports from IRIS, and the definition of EFS in other
analyses may incorporate additional events such as treatment discontinuation after toxicity. Depending on the
individual study/publication, PFS has been defined using
the definitions stated above for EFS or transformationfree survival.
Landmark analyses assessing the predictive value of
complete cytogenetic response or molecular responses at
different time points during first-line treatment are
reviewed below. To avoid confusion, endpoint definitions
for studies other than IRIS are specified instead of using
inconsistent terminology.
Predictive value of complete cytogenetic response

Across various clinical studies in the first-line setting, standard-dose imatinib treatment (400 mg/d)
resulted in a complete cytogenetic response in 45% to
59% of patients by 6 months, 57% to 72% by 12 months,
and 76% by 18 months.3,12,16,17,24-26 A recent update of
the IRIS study with 8-year follow-up included landmark
analyses based on level of cytogenetic response at 3, 6, 12,
and 18 months of treatment. Across all time points,
patients who had achieved a complete cytogenetic
response had the lowest rates of events or transformation
to AP/BP during long-term follow-up compared with
patients who had achieved inferior levels of cytogenetic
response (Table 2). Of patients who were assessable at 12
months, the rates of events and transformation to AP/BP
in patients who had achieved complete cytogenetic
response by 8 years were 6% and 3%, respectively, compared with 20% and 5% in patients who had achieved
only a partial cytogenetic response, and 62% and 37% in
patients who did not achieve complete cytogenetic
response or partial cytogenetic response at 12 months.
Thus, patients who had only achieved a partial cytogenetic
response at 12 months had a >3-fold higher incidence of

events during long-term follow-up compared with
patients who had achieved a complete cytogenetic
response.13 Similar findings from landmark analyses were
published in earlier reports from the IRIS trial.12,27
Landmark analyses based on cytogenetic response
at 12 and 18 months have also been performed using
data from single centers. In an analysis of 204 patients
with newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with imatinib at
the Hammersmith Hospital in London, United Kingdom, patients who had not achieved a complete cytogenetic response at 12 months had significantly lower rates
of survival without transformation to AP/BP (74%) and
OS (74%) than patients who had achieved a complete
cytogenetic response at 12 months (96% [P ¼ .007]
and 98% [P ¼ .03], respectively). This study was an
intention-to treat analysis, thus providing a more realistic estimation of clinical practice.25 In a further analysis
from the same institution, patients with a suboptimal
response at 12 months (ie, partial cytogenetic response
but not complete cytogenetic response) had significantly
worse rates of survival without transformation to AP/BP
and OS than patients with an optimal response (complete cytogenetic response) at 12 months.21 Further validation was provided by an independent cohort of 280
patients treated with imatinib at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas;
patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic response
at 12 and 18 months had significantly higher rates of
long-term survival without transformation to AP/BP or
loss of hematologic or cytogenetic response than patients
who had achieved a partial cytogenetic response. However, no significant difference in OS was observed within
the available follow-up. Patients who had achieved at
least a partial cytogenetic response by 6 or 12 months
did show significantly higher OS rates than patients who
had not achieved a partial cytogenetic response.23 In a
subsequent analysis of suboptimal versus optimal responders at 12 months performed at the same institution,
a difference was seen in long-term rates of events (26%
vs 8%, respectively) but not transformation to AP/BP
(both 5%).28 These studies thus show that earlier
responses are associated with improved EFS, with trends
for better survival free from transformation to AP/BP,
but with little if any improved OS, at least within available follow-up.
An alternative insight into the value of early
responses has been obtained through the TOPS (Tyrosine
Kinase Inhibitor Optimization and Selectivity) trial, a
phase 3 randomized study of imatinib 400 mg/d versus

Cancer

December 1, 2011

800 mg/d in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP.
Although the 800 mg/d arm had higher complete cytogenetic response rates than the 400 mg/d arm at 6 months
(45% vs 57%; P ¼ .015), rates were similar at 12 months
(66% vs 70%; P ¼ .347).24 After 24 months of follow-up,
rates of EFS (95% vs 95%; event ¼ death, transformation
to AP/BP, or loss of complete hematologic response or
major cytogenetic response), survival without transformation to AP/BP (97% vs 98%), and OS (97% vs 98%)
were similar for both arms.29

Predictive value of major molecular response

Across multiple first-line studies of standard-dose
imatinib (400 mg/d), a major molecular response was
achieved in 12% to 40% by 12 months and 50% to 52%
by 18 months.16,17,24,25,29 Analyses into the value of
achieving major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 transcript
reduction to 0.1% on the International Scale) during imatinib treatment have reported inconsistent findings across
different series. Although the first report from the IRIS
trial suggested that among patients with a complete cytogenetic response, those who had achieved a major molecular response had the best probability of survival free from
events or transformation,2 with longer follow-up and
larger number of patients assessed, the significance of
achieving a 12-month major molecular response was lost,
as shown by 7-year EFS rates of 92% versus 91% for
patients with transcript levels 0.1% (ie, major molecular
response) or >0.1 to 1% (ie, grossly equivalent to complete cytogenetic response without major molecular
response), respectively. However, the prognostic impact
for EFS of achieving major molecular response is maintained at 18 months, as patients who achieved complete
cytogenetic response without major molecular response by
18 months had a significantly poorer 7-year EFS than
those who achieved complete cytogenetic response and
major molecular response (86% vs 95%; P ¼ .01).3 However, the difference in the probability of survival free from
transformation to AP or BP is narrower (96% vs 99%, P
¼ .054).3 Achievement of both complete cytogenetic
response and major molecular response by 18 months was
predictive for complete cytogenetic response duration;
only 3% of patients lost their complete cytogenetic
response by 7 years compared with 26% of patients who
had a complete cytogenetic response but no major molecular response at 18 months (P < .001). No significant difference in long-term outcomes was seen in analyses of
these levels of response at 6 months.30

Review Article

Other analyses, mostly from single-institution studies of patients in complete cytogenetic response at 12 or
18 months, have also found no advantage in survival without transformation to AP/BP or OS associated with
achieving complete cytogenetic response plus major molecular response versus achieving only complete cytogenetic response.21,23,25,28 However, prolonged durability
of complete cytogenetic response associated with achieving major molecular response has been confirmed. In an
analysis from Hammersmith Hospital of patients with a
complete cytogenetic response, only 0% to 3% of patients
who achieved a major molecular response at 12 or 18
months subsequently lost their complete cytogenetic
response compared with 24% to 25% of patients who did
not achieve a major molecular response.21 In a separate
analysis, a stable complete cytogenetic response lasting at
least 12 months was associated with an improved rate of
survival without loss of hematologic or cytogenetic
response, transformation to AP/BP, or death from any
cause (P < .001).23
Molecular responses at early time points

Regardless of the prognostic importance of obtaining a major molecular response, the probability of
achieving such response may be concluded from the
depth of molecular response obtained at very early time
points during TKI therapy. An analysis of a subset of
patients from the IRIS trial showed that those who
failed to achieve a 1-log reduction of BCR-ABL1 level
(compared with the standardized baseline) by 3 months
or a 2-log reduction by 6 months had a significantly
lower probability of achieving a major molecular
response by 24 months compared with those who
achieved these responses. Achieving a 2-log reduction
by 6 months also predicted a lower occurrence of
events.31 In a single-institution analysis, the probability
of achieving a major molecular response after approximately 5 years of follow-up could be predicted using
the BCR-ABL1/ABL transcript ratio at 3 months; 84%
of patients who had a transcript ratio of >0.1% to 1%
achieved a major molecular response, compared with
53% who had a transcript ratio of >1% to 10%, and
33% who had a transcript ratio of >10%. The probabilities of eventually achieving major molecular response
based on achieving these BCR-ABL1 transcript ratios at
6 months were 69%, 44%, and 15%, respectively. Median time to major molecular response was also longer
in patients with inferior BCR-ABL1 reductions at these
time points.32

Competing Risks in Nonresponding Patients:
Probability of Response and Risk of
Progression
It is clear that during imatinib treatment, the proportion
of patients who have achieved a response at any time, that
is, cumulative response rates, continues to increase during
long-term treatment.12,25 For example, in the imatinib
arm of the IRIS study, estimated complete cytogenetic
response rates were 69% at 12 months and 87% at 60
months. These rates, however, do not reflect the proportion of patients who remained in complete cytogenetic
response at 60 months (65%-67%); annual rates of treatment failure during years 1 through 4 after complete cytogenetic response had been achieved were in 5.5%, 2.3%,
1.1%, and 0.4%, respectively.12 These data suggest that
80% of patients who are destined to achieve a complete
cytogenetic response on imatinib do so within the first 12
months of treatment. Similar cumulative increases in
major molecular response rates over time have also been
reported.25,33
An analysis by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center examined the long-term outcomes of
patients with CML-CP who did not achieve complete
cytogenetic response and/or major molecular response
during the first 12 months of treatment.32 Patients who
had not achieved complete cytogenetic response after 3, 6,
or 12 months of imatinib therapy exhibited a trend toward higher rates of events (loss or response, disease transformation, or death) over time. In parallel, the probability
of achieving a complete cytogenetic response significantly
decreased, as did the probability of reaching major molecular response (Table 3). At 3 and 6 months, the probability of achieving complete cytogenetic response remained
greater than the probability of an event occurring (P <
.001), whereas at 12 months, nonresponding patients had
similar probabilities of eventually achieving a complete
cytogenetic response or experiencing an event (42% vs
38%; P ¼ .15). Furthermore, the risks of achieving a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response,
or having an event can be concluded from the level of
BCR-ABL1 transcripts measured at early time points during imatinib therapy. Patients with the lowest levels of
BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3, 6, and 12 months had a
higher probability of achieving a complete cytogenetic
response and major molecular response and the lowest
probability of having an event (Table 4).
It can be hypothesized that the increasing risk of
events in nonresponding patients over time may be a consequence of continuous unopposed BCR-ABL1 activity,

which can result in genomic instability and may lead to
advanced phases of CML.34 Not surprisingly, patients
who achieve undetectable levels of BCR-ABL1 have a negligible risk of disease progression.12,13
Overall, clinical data indicate that first-line
treatment should not be continued indefinitely in nonresponding patients in the hope that treatment goals will be
achieved eventually, thus supporting the use of response
milestones during therapy, such as those established by
the European LeukemiaNet guidelines.6
Benefits of Early Switch to Newer BCR-ABL1
Inhibitors
For patients who fail imatinib, follow-up treatment
options include second-generation BCR-ABL1 inhibitors
(dasatinib or nilotinib), or in good candidates, allogeneic
stem cell transplantation.6 The timing of the switch to second-generation TKIs upon failure of imatinib therapy has
been shown to affect long-term treatment outcome. A single-institution analysis found that patients who received
dasatinib or nilotinib after cytogenetic relapse on imatinib
had higher survival rates than patients who were treated
after hematologic relapse (3-year survival of 92% vs
52%).22 This observation was investigated in more detail
in a retrospective analysis of patients in 3 clinical trials of

on imatinib. Patients were grouped according to whether
they received dasatinib after loss of cytogenetic response
on imatinib (earlier intervention) or after loss of both
cytogenetic and hematologic response on imatinib (later
intervention). During dasatinib treatment, complete cytogenetic response was achieved by 72% of patients with
earlier intervention compared with loss of 42% of patients
with later intervention. Respective 2-year rates of survival
without transformation to AP/BP, loss of complete hematologic response or major cytogenetic response, and
increased white cell count were 89% versus 29%, and
rates of survival without transformation to AP/BP were
98% versus 93%.35 These data suggest that continuing
imatinib treatment until hematologic relapse in patients
who have already experienced cytogenetic relapse is associated with worse outcomes on subsequent treatment, supporting earlier treatment switch in patients failing TKI
therapy. This analysis refers to patients who have experienced failure on therapy. Whether interventions such as
dose increase or change of therapy alter the outcome of
patients who have only a suboptimal response has not
been documented.
Second-Generation TKIs as First-Line Therapy
Dasatinib and nilotinib, 2 agents with increased inhibitory activity against BCR-ABL1 kinase, have been

approved for the treatment of CML after failure of imatinib therapy. Dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL1 in vitro.36 Dasatinib
has a chemical structure unrelated to that of imatinib and
binds to BCR-ABL1 at a different although overlapping
binding site.37 Nilotinib is 20-fold more potent than imatinib in vitro. Nilotinib was developed by modifying the
chemical structure of imatinib and therefore binds to a
binding site nearly identical to the imatinib binding site
within BCR-ABL1, albeit with an improved topological
fit.36,38 After the demonstration of the efficacy of dasatinib and nilotinib in patients with resistance or intolerance
to imatinib,39 early single-arm trials assessed the activity
of these agents in the frontline setting. These trials found
that first-line treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib
resulted in higher rates of complete cytogenetic response
and major molecular response at early time points relative
to historical data for imatinib.40-42
Recently, primary data have been published from 2
randomized multicenter phase 3 trials comparing the activity of either dasatinib or nilotinib with that of imatinib
as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed
CML-CP. In the ENESTnd trial (Evaluating Nilotinib
Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials of Newly Diagnosed
Phþ CML patients), 2 different doses of nilotinib were
assessed (300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily).
The primary endpoint was the major molecular response
rate at 12 months.17 At 12 months, major molecular
response rates for nilotinib (44% with 300 mg twice daily,
43% with 400 mg twice daily) were significantly higher
than those achieved with imatinib treatment (22%; P <
.001 vs both nilotinib arms). In addition, complete cytogenetic response rates by 12 months were also significantly
higher for the nilotinib arms compared with imatinib
(80% for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 78% for nilotinib
400 mg twice daily, 65% for imatinib; both P < .001).
Complete cytogenetic response rates at 6 months showed
a similar trend (67% vs 63% vs 45%, respectively).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that in the total group, median time to major molecular response was 8.6 months
with nilotinib 300 mg, 11.0 months with nilotinib 400
mg, and not reached with imatinib. Rates of BCR-ABL1
transcript reduction to 0.0032% or less (the limit of sensitivity of the PCR assay) by data cutoff were 13%, 12%,
and 4%, respectively. Improvements were seen in rates of
transformation to AP/BP for patients who received nilotinib compared with those who received imatinib (<1%
with nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg vs 4% with imatinib;
P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .004, respectively, based on an analysis

of time to transformation to AP/BP). The benefit of
achieving a major molecular response was demonstrated
in both the nilotinib and the dasatinib trials, in which no
patient who had achieved major molecular response progressed to AP/BP at last follow-up.
In the DASISION trial (Dasatinib vs Imatinib
Study in Treatment-Naive CML Patients), complete
cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates
by 12 months were significantly higher with dasatinib
100 mg once daily compared with imatinib 400 mg
once daily (complete cytogenetic response: 83% vs 72%,
P ¼ .0011; major molecular response: 46% vs 28%, P
< .0001).16 The primary study endpoint, rate of confirmed complete cytogenetic response by 12 months
(defined as complete cytogenetic response detected on 2
consecutive assessments), was also significantly superior
with dasatinib compared with imatinib (77% vs 66%,
respectively; P ¼ .0067). Furthermore, patients who
received dasatinib reached complete cytogenetic response
and major molecular response faster than those who
received imatinib. At 3 months, complete cytogenetic
response rates were 54% with dasatinib versus 31% with
nilotinib, increasing to 73% versus 59%, respectively, at
6 months. Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to response
showed that patients in the dasatinib arm had an approximate 50% increase in probability of complete cytogenetic response and 100% increase in probability of
major molecular response at any time compared with
imatinib (hazard ratios were 1.5 for complete cytogenetic response and 2.0 for major molecular response;
both P < .0001).16 Among the subgroup of patients
who achieved major molecular response, median time to
major molecular response was 6.3 months for dasatinib
and 9.2 months for imatinib. At last follow-up, 1.9% of
patients who received dasatinib and 3.5% of those who
received imatinib had progressed to AP/BP.16
These results led to the US Food and Drug Administration and European approval in 2010 of nilotinib 300
mg twice daily and dasatinib 100 mg once daily for firstline treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. Overall, the
results reported by the ENESTnd and DASISION studies
suggest that frontline therapy with second-generation
TKIs produces higher rates of cytogenetic and molecular
responses compared with standard-dose imatinib, and
that these responses are achieved at earlier time points. On
the basis of data derived from the IRIS trial highlighting
the prognostic importance of achieving early complete
cytogenetic response and major molecular response, it is
reasonable to expect that the use of nilotinib or dasatinib

in the frontline setting might render higher rates of EFS
and transformation-free survival, but this remains to be
proven. Whether the latter translate into improved OS
remains to be determined, and longer-term follow-up is
needed to confirm these predictions.
Conclusions
Long-term follow-up of patients treated with imatinib for
CML-CP indicates that early achievement of complete
cytogenetic response or major molecular response during
first-line therapy is a favorable predictive factor and is associated with prolonged protection against transformation to
AP/BP. This benefit of early response can be seen within
the first few months after initiation of imatinib treatment.
However, in patients who have not achieved these
responses, the probability of complete cytogenetic response
or major molecular response with imatinib gradually
decreases over time with a concurrent increase in the risk of
disease progression over time. Landmark analyses have
demonstrated that achieving a complete cytogenetic
response by 12 months is associated with improved transformation-free survival and EFS, and although analyses of
major molecular response have been inconsistent, available
data also suggest that patients who achieve an major molecular response by 18 months are more likely to have a favorable EFS compared with those failing to achieve such
response. It might be predicted that newer agents that are
able to provide higher rates of earlier complete cytogenetic
response or major molecular response are also likely to provide a long-term benefit. Whether this is confirmed with
additional follow-up will likely depend on whether superior
response rates observed with early treatment are maintained
with longer follow-up. In the TOPS trial, improved
response rates at 6 months but not at 12 months during
imatinib treatment did not result in improved 24-month
rate of survival without transformation to AP/BP. Lastly, it
must be noted that given the very high rates of EFS, transformation-free survival, and OS reported in the 8-year
update of the IRIS trial with the use of imatinib 400 mg
daily and the available effective salvage therapy for patients
who develop resistance to imatinib, any potential improvement on such metrics derived from the use of second-generation TKIs in the frontline setting may require a very
long follow-up time for it to be detected.
