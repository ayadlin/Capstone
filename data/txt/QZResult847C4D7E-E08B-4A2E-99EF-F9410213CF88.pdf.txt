Abstract
Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of Raf, VEGF and PDGF receptor signaling
is approved for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One strategy to improve
HCC therapy is to combine agents that target key signaling pathways. Aberrant
mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) activation is associated with a
variety of human malignancies and therefore represents a target for therapy. In this
study, we investigated a novel c-Met inhibitor, DE605, together with sorafenib in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DE605 and sorafenib synergistically
induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, DE605 activated
the FGFR3/Erk pathway, which in turn was inhibited by sorafenib, resulting in
synergism. Finally, DE605 and sorafenib significantly inhibited growth of PLC/PRF/5
hepatocellular carcinoma tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. Importantly, no
obvious weight loss (toxicity) was detected. Thus in combination, DE605 and sorafenib
target complementary anti-apoptotic pathways and synergistically suppress HCC,
providing the rationale for clinical studies with this novel combination.

Introduction

III studies indicated that sorafenib improved survival and
the time to radiologic progression, leading to its approval
for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
[5, 6]. Sorafenib has also been approved for the treatment
of advanced renal cell carcinoma, and recent preclinical
studies have shown that it has broad-spectrum activity
against models of several other human cancers, including
melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer,
and breast cancer [7]. Sorafenib executes its antitumor
activities by targeting the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, inducing
cell apoptosis and blocking tumor angiogenesis [8]. In
addition, recent evidence has indicated that Stat3 is a
major kinase-independent target of sorafenib [9, 10].
The mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
(c-Met) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) as its only known high-affinity
ligand. During embryonic development, c-Met controls
morphogenesis, invasiveness, and migration of precursor
cells. In adult life, the protein is typically expressed
at low levels in a range of tissues, predominantly

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major
health problem worldwide as the third cause of cancerrelated mortality and the primary cause of death among
cirrhotic patients [1]. Hepatitis B and C, alcohol and
aflatoxin have been identified as major risk factors leading
to the development of HCC [2, 3]. Curative treatments,
such as locoregional ablation, surgical resection, or liver
transplantation, are only appropriate for a minority of
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and their efficacies
are limited by high recurrence rates. As most patients are
diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, there is an urgent
need for new systemic therapies [4]. Currently, sorafenib
(Nexavar) is the only drug that has been approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib is an
oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks various signaling
pathways, including Raf kinases, VEGF, and plateletderived growth factor receptors. In 2007, a pair of phase

involved in tissue repair, and activated by pathologic
stimulation. More specifically, c-Met is essential in liver
development and regeneration. In conditional c-Met
knockout mice, liver repair is delayed or absent after
hepatectomy or chemically induced liver injury [11].
In contrast, overexpression of HGF has been shown to
increase liver regeneration and to cause significant liver
enlargement after partial hepatectomy in mice [12].
However, c-Met expression is deregulated in many human
malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
[13]. In the cancer setting, c-Met/HGF mediates cellular
proliferation, tumor invasion, and metastasis [14]. The
underlying biologic mechanisms for the tumorigenicity
of c-Met appear to involve the establishment of c-Met/
HGF autocrine loops, overexpression of c-Met or HGF,
and kinase-activating mutations in the c-Met gene [15].
Overexpression of c-Met alone has been demonstrated to
be sufficient for developing HCC in Met-transgenic mice
[16, 17]. In addition, c-MET overexpression is observed in
20-48% of human HCC samples [18-20] and where it may
be a predictor for sensitivity to agents such as the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor sorafenib [21].
Although systemic treatment with sorafenib is the
recommended treatment in advanced HCC, its survival
benefit is still limited, and novel tumor targets such as
c-Met are warranted in this setting [22]. The use of c-Met
inhibitors as a potentially viable treatment is supported by
preclinical data showing that c-Met inhibition suppresses
the growth of c-Met-positive HCC tumor cells [14, 23].
Given that hepatocellular carcinoma is a complex
and heterogeneous tumor with aberrant activation of
several signaling pathways, researchers have sought
to target hepatocellular carcinoma with a combination
of sorafenib plus chemotherapy or another targeted
therapeutic agent [24-26]. This study was undertaken to
evaluate the preclinical efficacy of the c-Met inhibitor,
DE605, in combination with sorafenib in human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We herein report, for
the first time, that DE605 and sorafenib exhibited a
synergistic interaction in killing hepatocellular carcinoma
cells, inducing marked apoptosis via a caspase-dependent
pathway. Our data suggest that the sorafenib-mediated
inhibition of the DE605-activated fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3 (FGFR3)/Erk signaling pathway may be a major
component of the observed synergism. Moreover, we show
that the combined treatment significantly decreases tumor
volume in the PLC/PRF/5 xenograft model, compared
with treatment by either drug alone. Taken together, these
findings indicate that our combined treatment warrants
further development for potential therapeutic applications
in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

DE605 is a potent inhibitor of c-Met
DE605 was synthesized to specifically interact with
c-Met and inhibit its kinase activity. The biochemical
activity of this compound was measured in a flash-plate
assay using recombinant human c-Met kinase domain and
a biotinylated peptide substrate. Under these conditions,
DE605 inhibited c-Met kinase activity with an average
IC50 of 12.3 nM. To assess the selectivity of DE605 for
c-Met kinase activity, this compound was profiled against
a protein kinase panel of 242 human kinases. At 15.6
μM of DE605, a concentration approximately 1,200-fold
above the IC50, DE605 showed an exceptionally high
level of kinase selectivity toward c-Met with an inhibitory
activity of more than 3,000-fold in comparison with the
other 241 human kinases tested, as none of these kinases
was inhibited by more than 50%.
We next investigated whether DE605 could inhibit
c-Met phosphorylation induced in liver cancer cells by
different mechanisms. To this end, we used the PLC/
PRF/5 and Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines,
in which c-Met phosphorylation is respectively triggered
by HGF binding or by c-Met gene amplification and
ligand-independent activation. As shown in Fig. 1A
and B, exposure of PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B cells to
DE605 resulted in inhibition of HGF-induced c-Met
phosphorylation, with an average IC50 of 4.1 and 5.6
nM, respectively. Moreover, we defined the efficiency of
the cellular uptake and retention of DE605. A series of
wash-out studies was conducted, in which PLC/PRF/5
and Hep3B cells were incubated for 30 to 45 minutes
in the presence of different concentrations of DE605,
washed, stimulated with HGF, and subsequently assessed
for c-Met phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that
c-Met phosphorylation was inhibited upon exposure
to DE605 and lasted for more than 20 hours in PLC/
PRF/5 and Hep3B cells, with an average IC50 of 5.4 and
7.2 nM, respectively. These data show cellular retention
of DE605, accompanied by sustained c-Met inhibition.
Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DE605 on HGFinduced c-Met phosphorylation was only moderately
affected by the presence of 10% (v/v) murine or human
serum, resulting in average IC50 values of 14.7 and 19.1
nM, respectively. Higher serum concentrations could not
be used in this test, as they suppressed the HGF-induced
c-Met phosphorylation, probably because of HGF binding
to serum proteins or HGF inactivation by serum proteases.
Taken together, our data indicate that DE605 is a potential
and reversible inhibitor of c-Met.

Effects of DE605 and sorafenib on cell viability in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells

also exhibited a synergistic effect in combination with
sorafenib at low concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 μM), which
is similar to those obtained in sorafenib combination with
DE605 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Moreover, the synergistic
effect between DE605 and sorafenib were also observed
in Hep3B, HepG2 and HuH7 cells, indicating that this
was not a cell line–specific effect (Fig. 2B, 2C and
2D). Furthermore, the combined treatment significantly
enhanced the antiproliferative effects in all four tested
cell lines as evidenced by BrdU incorporation assay
(Fig. 2E). Taken together, our results indicate that DE605
combination with sorafenib synergistically increased
cytotoxicity and improved the anti-proliferative effects
consistently in different hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines.

The effects of DE605 and sorafenib on cell
viability in four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were
determined using a MTT assay. PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B,
HepG2 and HuH7 Cells were treated with different
concentrations of DE605 (0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM) and
sorafenib (0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM) for 72 h. As shown in
Fig. 1C, DE605 was able to repress cell growth in all four
cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values
of 3.4, 4.5, 1.2 and 2.0 µM, respectively. Interestingly,
the cell lines exhibited differential sensitivities to the
cytotoxic effects of sorafenib. HepG2 and HuH7 were
sensitive to sorafenib, with IC50 values of 3.3 and 2.4
µM, respectively. Whereas, PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B were
more resistant, with IC50 values of 6.7 and 10.5 µM,
respectively (Fig. 1D). In order to determine the side
effects of DE605 on normal cells, HL-7702 normal liver
cells were treated with DE605 or sorafenib. We obtained
that DE605 and sorafenib exhibited similar cytotoxicity in
HL-7702 normal liver cells. However, DE605 exhibited
a little lower cytotoxicity in HL-7702 cells than in HCC
cells (supplemental Fig.S2A). Here, we further confirmed
the epigenetic effects of DE605 by western blotting
analysis of c-Met, and apoptotic markers in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, DE605 inhibited the
phosphorylation of c-Met expression in all four cell lines.
This was accompanied by the induction of cleavage of
PARP. Collectively, our results indicate that both DE605
and sorafenib exhibited cytotoxic effects in hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

DE605 in combination with sorafenib enhances
apoptotic cell death via a caspase-dependent
pathway
As sorafenib and c-Met inhibitors reportedly induce
apoptosis in cancer cells [8, 28], we examined the impact
of our drug combination on programmed cell death. First,
the effect of co-administration of DE605 and sorafenib on
cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometric
analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, no appreciable cell-cycle
arrest was observed after sorfenib or DE605 treatment
alone. However, the combined treatment significantly
enhanced the percentage of sub-G1 phase cells over that
seen in cells treated with either drug alone, suggesting that
apoptosis is the main cause of cell death in the co-treated
PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3B).
Meanwhile, the possibility of necrotic effect was
excluded by examining LDH leakage in the supernatants
of drug-treated PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 4A). To confirm
this effect, nucleosome formation (representing DNA
fragmentation) was determined in drug-treated cells.
The results showed that DE605 dramatically enhanced
sorafenib-induced nucleosome formation in PLC/PRF/5
cells (Fig. 4B).
We further investigated the underlying mechanism
of co-treatment-induced apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells
by western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C,
when cells were co-treated with sorafenib and DE605 at
concentrations lower than the IC50 value, we observed
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, indicating the occurrence
of apoptosis. Moreover, caspase-8 and caspase-9 were also
activated by the combined treatment, indicating that both
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved
in this phenomenon. Furthermore, co-treatment with the
pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD–FMK, attenuated PARP
cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting
that the observed apoptosis was triggered via a caspasedependent pathway (Fig. 4D). Overall, these data indicate
that the synergism between sorafenib and DE605 in killing

Synergistic interaction between DE605 and
sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
To investigate the effect of the combined treatment
in experimental models of HCC, four hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines were treated with different
concentrations of sorafenib in the presence or absence of
DE605 for 72 hours, and cell viability was determined by
MTT assay. Our results revealed that DE605 significantly
and concentration-dependently enhanced sorafenibmediated cytotoxicity in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 2A). To
explore whether the combined treatment had a synergistic
impact on cell viability, the combination index values of
each dose were calculated by the CompuSyn software. The
results revealed that DE605 exhibited a synergistic effect
in combination with sorafenib at low concentrations (0.5
and 1.0 μM) (Fig. 2A, right). In addition, to confirm these
results, PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with sorafenib and
a previously reported c-MET selective inhibitor tivantinib
(ARQ 197) [27] for 72 hours, cell viability was determined
by MTT assay and combination index values was
calculated. Interestingly, the results revealed that tivantinib

the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, and patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma with higher levels of phosphorylated Erk
have a better survival rate [8, 29]. Furthermore, Stat3
was recently reported to be a major kinase-independent
target of sorafenib [10]. Therefore, we postulated that
the combination of DE605 and sorafenib might impact
these signaling pathways. Interestingly, our data show
that DE605 alone dramatically elevated the level of
phosphorylated-Erk (p-Erk) and increased its downstream
signaling, as reflected by increases in phosphorylatedStat3-Ser727 (p-Stat3). These effects were concentrationdependently abrogated by sorafenib (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
forced expression of constitutively active Mek attenuated
the co-treatment-induced PARP cleavage, suggesting that
the sorafenib-mediated inactivation of Erk may play a

To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying
the synergistic interaction between sorafenib and DE605
in PLC/PRF/5 cells, we examined whether the combined
treatment enhanced the signaling pathways affected by
each agent alone. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no
profound enhancement of c-Met following the combined
treatment. Therefore, the observed synergistic effects may
not result from augmentation of the epigenetic effects
triggered by DE605. Sorafenib has been shown to inhibit

pivotal role in DE605-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5B). In
addition, pharmacologic inhibition of Mek by PD98059
attenuated DE605-induced p-Erk (Fig. 5C), confirming the
importance of Erk activation in the synergistic interaction
between DE605 and sorafenib. We further investigated the
mechanism behind Erk activation by cDNA microarray to
examine differential expressed genes affected by DE605
(1.0 μM) in PLC/PRF/5 cells. The result showed that
the mRNA level of FGFR3 was up-regulated by DE605,
but this phenomenon was abrogated in the presence
of sorafenib (Fig. 5D). Moreover, the protein levels of
FGFR3 and p-Erk were also up-regulated by DE605 in a
concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5E). Furthermore,
co-administration of FGFR3 inhibitor (PD173074)
or silencing of FGFR3 attenuated DE605-induced
Erk phosphorylation, suggesting that transcriptional
activation of FGFR3 may contribute to Erk activation
in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 5F and 5G). Furthermore, in
order to provide evidences that the mechanism behind
Erk activation is not specific to PLC/PRF/5 cells, we
employed another hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
Hep3B for further experiments. The results showed that
the mRNA level of FGFR3 was up-regulated by DE605
and abrogated in the presence of sorafenib in Hep3B
cells (supplemental Fig. S3A). The protein levels of
FGFR3 and p-Erk were also up-regulated by DE605 in a
concentration-dependent fashion (supplemental Fig.S3B).

cells that the mechanism is not specific to PLC/PRF/5
cells. Collectively, these data suggest that the synergistic
interaction between DE605 and sorafenib is achieved at
least partially via inhibition of the FGFR3/Erk signaling
pathway.

treatment groups compared with the control group. These
data suggest that the treatment in these studies is not
associated with apparent gross toxicity.

DE605 plus sorafenib inhibits proliferation with
induction of apoptosis in tumor tissues
To correlate the in vivo antitumor effects with the
mechanisms identified in vitro, intratumoral biomarkers
were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis.
Uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation is a characteristic
feature of most cancers. We therefore analyzed the
hepatocellular carcinoma tumor xenografts for the
potential anti-proliferative effects of DE605 plus sorafenib
using immunohistochemical detection of Ki-67-positive
cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, co-administration of DE605
and sorafenib significantly decreased the expression of Ki67, a cell proliferation marker. In addition, to determine
whether inhibition of tumor growth by administration
DE605 plus sorafenib is caused by the apoptosis of tumor
cells in xenograft tissues, the apoptotic effect of DE605
plus sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissues
was identified by expression of the DNA fragment by
TUNEL assay. The results showed that greater numbers of
TUNEL-positive cells in the samples from co-treatment
as compared with the numbers in the samples from the
non-treated tumors (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data
are consistent with our in vitro data, indicating that coadministration with DE605 and sorafenib significantly
enhanced the antitumor activity in vivo.

Discussion
Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains
a major health problem, as it is the sixth most common
cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide [1]. There are multiple therapeutic
options for this disease, resection and transplantation
are the only curative treatments available but are greatly
hampered by high recurrence rates [3]. HCC is a complex
and heterogeneous tumor that has been associated
with genomic aberrations. The key signal transduction
pathways that have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of hepatocellular carcinoma are the EGFR, Ras/Raf/Mek/
Erk, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, mTOR, HGF/c-Met,
Wnt, and Hedgehog signaling cascades [24]. Drugs that
selectively target these molecules might, therefore, have
therapeutic potential.
Currently, the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib
is the only FDA-approved treatment for patients with
advanced disease, necessitating the development of novel
compounds that are effective against this devastating
disease [6, 30]. However, sorafenib mainly delays the
time to radiologic progression rather than inducing tumor
regression. Therefore, new approaches with improved

DE605 plus sorafenib inhibits tumor xenograft
growth in athymic nude mice
To evaluate whether the synergistic effect of DE605
plus sorafenib could be clinically relevant, we examined
the antitumor activity of this cotreatment in athymic nude
mice bearing established PLC/PRF/5 tumor xenografts. As
seen in Fig. 6A, Oral treatment with sorafenib or DE605
alone for 28 days resulted in a modest tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) in the nude mice (17.3% and 37.3%,
respectively) compared with the control group. DE605 in
combination with sorafenib significantly suppressed tumor
growth, with TGI of 59.7%. In addition, the cotreatment
exhibited significant difference compared with sorafenib
or DE605 alone in the PLC/PRF/5 xenograft model.
Moreover, the average body weights of the mice were
comparable throughout the experimental period. As seen
in Fig. 6B, there was no difference in body weight in

therapeutic efficacy are urgently needed. A number of
treatment strategies have been developed for patients
who do not respond to or tolerate sorafenib, including
the use of monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ramucirumab)
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib, sunitinib,
vandetanib, cediranib, brivanib, foretinib, and dovitinib)
[4]. In addition, combined treatment with sorafenib plus
another agent, such as erlotinib, everolimus, or CS1008, is currently being investigated [31]. Nonetheless,
few of them are testing the efficacy of a c-Met inhibitor
combination with sorafenib in this difficult-to-treat cancer.
In the present study, we provide compelling evidence
that DE605, a novel potent inhibitor of c-Met, combined
treatment with sorafenib significantly inhibits the growth
of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in

The rationale behind developing c-Met kinase
inhibitors for the treatment of cancer is based on multiple
lines of preclinical evidence showing that aberrant
activation of the c-Met/HGF signaling pathway plays
a pivotal role in cancer progression and metastasis by
promoting cell proliferation, survival, and motility [32].
Dysregulation of the c-Met/HGF pathway can occur by
ligand-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Indeed,
overexpression of wild-type c-Met or engagement by
HGF in an autocrine or paracrine fashion induces tumor
transformation [33, 34]. Thus, c-Met are promising drug
targets for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Small-molecule kinase inhibitors have a broad
therapeutic efficacy and their development is becoming

increasingly feasible as a result of the improved
understanding of the structure and molecular mode of
action of kinases. Based on these studies and increasing
preclinical evidence, a number of c-Met inhibitors are
currently under study in several clinical trial phases [27].
In addition to being tested as a single therapeutic agent,
c-Met inhibitors are also being assessed in combination
with chemotherapy agents [35, 36]. Our preclinical data
show that DE605 block constitutive phosphorylation of
c-Met, thereby interfering with survival of susceptible
tumor cells. Such observations are in agreement with
reports on the effects of JNJ-38877605, INCB28060,
EMD 1214063 and EMD 1204831, which also belong to
the category of type I c-Met inhibitors [37, 38].
Our in vitro study shows that treatment with
sorafenib in PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B cells have higher
IC50 than HepG2 and HuH7 cells. These data reinforce
the results reported earlier, which showed PLC/PRF/5
and Hep3B are most resistant to sorafenib among
different liver cancer cell lines [39, 40]. On the basis of
these findings, we used PLC/PRF/5 cells in most of the
mechanistic studies to elucidate the synergistic effects
of DE605 and sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma. In
the present study, we observed a synergistic interaction
between DE605 and sorafenib in human hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. Therefore, DE605 not only has a broad
spectrum of action against different types of cancer, it also
offers a new tool for treating hepatocellular carcinoma
when combined with sorafenib.
From a therapeutic point of view, it remains
controversial as to whether single- or multiple-targeted
inhibitors are most advantageous. Clinical evidence
suggests that multiple-targeted inhibitors may be more
often associated with dose-limiting effects, whereas
single-targeted kinase inhibitors can be used at maximal
dosing level without causing toxic effects. Indeed, XL880
and XL184, which target multiple, non-family-related
kinases including VEGF receptor, are associated with
dose-limiting toxicities that may not be attributed to c-Met
inhibition [37]. On the other hand, the achievement of
therapeutic effects with DE605 and sorafenib may require
thorough patient screening to identify a responsive subset,
in which the tumor is sensitive to selective disruption of
the c-Met signaling pathway.
Sorafenib executes its antitumor activities, which
include triggering cell apoptosis and blocking tumor
angiogenesis, by targeting the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. A
previous study showed that patients with high levels of
p-Erk have a greater survival rate [8]. It was reported
that treatment with c-met inhibitor leads to inhibit
phosphorylation of ERK, down-stream signals of c-Met
[41, 42]. However, the functional role of the activation of
Erk kinase is often controversially discussed. By contrast,
Liu et al. [43, 44] showed that inhibition of c-Met was
associated with ERK activation in human lung cancer A549
cells. Of special interest was the observation that DE605,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at the concentrations below IC50 value, dramatically
activated Erk and aspects of its downstream signaling,
such as p-Stat3-Ser727. DE605-mediated Erk activation
was concentration-dependently abrogated by sorafenib.
Ectopic expression of constitutively active Mek reversed
the apoptotic cell death triggered by the co-treatment in
PLC/PRF/5 cells. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition
of Mek attenuated DE605-induced p-Erk. Therefore,
we postulated that treatment with low concentrations of
DE605 may render hepatocellular carcinoma cells more
dependent on Erk signaling and increase their sensitivity
to sorafenib. Our observations are in accordance with
previous studies showing that interruption of Erk signaling
by Mek inhibitors sensitized tumor cells to kinase
inhibitor–induced apoptosis [39, 45-47].
In the present study, we observed the transcriptional
activation of FGFR3 by DE605, and that was abrogated in
the presence of sorafenib. DE605-induced Erk activation
was abrogated by FGFR3 inhibitor (PD173074),
suggesting that FGFR3 induction may be the underlying
mechanism of Erk phosphorylation. Such observations are
in agreement with reports on the effects of panobinostat
and MPT0E028 [39, 48]. In this study, we provide
compelling evidence that combined treatment with the
c-Met inhibitor, DE605, plus sorafenib synergistically
inhibits the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma
cells in vitro. Moreover, we further reinforce the data by
elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which sorafenib
enhances DE605-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting the
FGFR3/Erk signaling pathway.
Although in vitro cell culture models are a good
system for preliminary screening of the effects of antitumor agents; the observations must be verified in vivo
using animal models prior to their potential consideration
of their use in humans. We therefore used an in vivo
model of xenografts of PLC/PRF/5 tumor cells in athymic
nude mice to verify the anti-tumor potential of DE605
combination with sorafenib against liver tumor cell
growth. Our study provides evidence that administration
of DE605 plus sorafenib significantly inhibits the growth
of PLC/PRF/5 liver tumor xenografts without any
apparent sign of toxicity in the athymic nude mice. These
data are in accordance with the decreased proliferation
documented by Ki67 immunostaining. Additionally,
DE605 plus sorafenib induced apoptosis as indicated by
TUNEL staining in tumor tissues. These in vivo results are
similar to our in vitro study, which further suggests that
DE605 combination with sorafenib may be an applicable
approach to enhance the antitumor activity against liver
cancer. In contrast, Bladt et al. [49] reported that the c-Met
inhibitor MSC2156119J (EMD 1214063) combination
with sorafenib did not improve efficacy in MHCC97H
human HCC xenograft model and HuPrime model with
human HCC explants. Therefore, different results may be
showed in different c-Met inhibitor and xenograft tumor
models.

CO2 atmosphere.

In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
DE605 and sorafenib interact in a synergistic manner to
invoke strong anticancer activity against hepatocellular
carcinoma by inducing apoptosis as well as inhibiting
cell growth/proliferation. Moreover, we also show that
sorafenib-mediated inhibition of DE605-induced Erk
activation might play a pivotal role in this synergistic
effect. These results suggest that combining DE605 with
the standard of care sorafenib could be an attractive
strategy for treating patients with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma.

c-Met in vitro kinase assay
Kinase inhibition by DE605 was assessed in vitro
using a panel of 242 different kinases. Biochemical
activity was measured in a flash-plate assay. His6tagged recombinant human c-Met kinase domain (Aa
974–end; 20 ng) and biotinylated poly-Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr
(6:2:5:1; 500 ng) were incubated with or without the test
compound for 90 minutes at room temperature in 100 μl
buffer containing 0.3 μCi 33P-ATP, 2.5 μg polyethylene
glycol 20.000, and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as
previously described [50]. Radioactivity was measured
with a TopCount microplate scintillation and luminescence
counter (Packard BioScience BV). Inhibitory 50%
concentration values (IC50) were calculated by nonlinear
regression analysis using the RS/1 software program.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents
Antibodies were obtained from the following
commercial sources: PARP, caspase-3, caspase-8,
caspase-9, phospho-Erk, and Erk (Cell Signaling
Technology); p-c-Met, c-Met, and FGFR3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); pan-actin (Millipore); phospho-stat3Ser727 and Stat3 (BD Biosciences). propidium iodide,
MTT, z-VAD–FMK, PD98059, PD173074, and all of
the other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma.
RPMI-1640 medium, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM), FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and all
other tissue culture regents were obtained from GIBCO/
BRL Life Technologies. Sorafenib (purity ≥ 99%) was
purchased from Biovision. Tivantinib (ARQ 197) was
purchased from ChemieTek. For in vitro administration,
sorafenib, tivantinib or DE605 (structure and scheme of
DE605 synthesis shown in supplemental Fig. S1) were
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) to a concentration of 10
mM and further diluted to appropriate final concentration
in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. DMSO in
the final solution did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). For in vivo
testing, sorafenib or DE605 were dissolved in Cremophor
EL/ethanol (50:50; Sigma Cremophor EL, 95% ethanol)
at 4 × concentration. This 4 × solution was prepared fresh
every 4 days. Final dosing concentration was prepared by
diluting the 4 × solution to 1× with sterile water. The 1×
solution was prepared just before it was given to the mice.

Phospho-c-Met-capture ELISA
Total c-Met phosphorylation was assessed by
c-Met–capture ELISA in Nunc-Immuno MicroWell 96well solid plates (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described
[37]. PLC/PRF/5 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
were seeded 2 days before treatment, serum-starved for 20
hours, and treated on day 3 with different concentrations
of DE605 or 0.1% DMSO for 45 minutes at 37°C, 5%
CO2. Upon stimulation with 100 ng/ml HGF for 5 minutes,
cells were lysed with 70 μl per well ice-cold lysis buffer
[20 nmol/l HEPES, pH 7,4; 10% (V/V) Glycerol; 150
nmol/l NaCl; 1% (V/V) Triton-X-100; 2 nmol/l EDTA]
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
In the wash-out experiments, PLC/PRF/5 were treated
with DE605 for 45 minutes, washed, and incubated in
serum-free medium for 14 hours, before stimulation with
HGF (100 ng/ml). In the ELISA, the capture antibody was
specific for the c-Met extracellular domain, whereas an
anti-phosphotyrosine biotin-labeled antibody was used for
detection. Tyrosine phosphorylation was revealed using a
streptavidin peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescence
read-out.

MTT assay

Cell culture

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3,000 cells/
well) and incubated overnight for attachment, and
were then treated with indicated agents in 10% FBSsupplemented medium for 72 hours. The medium was
replaced with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) at 37°C for 2 hours.
After removal of medium, the cells were lysed with 200
μl per well dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and absorbance
at 570 nm was measured and the values of 50% inhibition
concentration (IC50) for each drug were determined. Cell

Human hepatocellular carcinomacell lines, PLC/
PRF/5, Hep3B, HepG2 and HuH7, as well as normal
liver cell line HL-7702 were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and cultured as
recommended as monolayers in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
Logan, UT), penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100
μg/ml)/amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) from Invitrogen

viability was evaluated by measuring the optical density at
570 nm using an Automated Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek,
USA). The percentage of viable cells was calculated using
the following formula: cell viability (%) = (OD of treated
cells/OD of control cells) × 100. All assays were performed
in triplicate with at least 3 independent experiments.
The combination index value was determined from the
fraction-affected value of each combination according to
the Chou–Talalay method by using CompuSyn software
(ComboSyn, Inc.), and a combination index value below

amounts of protein (30 μg) from each cell lysate were
resolved on SDS-PAGE. Gels were electroblotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μM; Bio-Rad), which
were then incubated in blocking solution (1×PBS, 0.1%
Tween-20, 5% non-fat dry milk powder) for 1 h at
room temperature. Membranes were incubated with the
primary antibody at 4°C overnight. After additional TBST
washes, membranes were incubated with corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature and detected by the
enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West
Pico substrate; Pierce; Rockford, IL).

Cell proliferation assay

Real time qRT-PCR analysis

Cell
proliferation
was
assessed
by
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay using the
Proliferation Assay Kit (Millipore). Cells were seeded in
96-well plates (5,000 cells/well) with 10% FBS in culture
medium, and treated with indicated agents for 72 hours.
BrdU was added during last 2 hours of incubation period.
The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted
in Trizol (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The first-strand cDNA
was synthesized using 1.0 µg total RNA and the
iScriptTMReverse Transcription Supermix for real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Bio-Rad). PCR
was performed in triplicate using the SsoFastTM Probes
Supermix (Bio-Rad)in a final reaction volume of 10 µl
with gene-specific primer/probe sets, and a standard
thermal cycling procedure(40 cycles) on a Bio-Rad
CFX96TM Real-Time PCR System. RNA levels of FGFR3
and 18S were assessed using the TaqMan Gene Expression
real-time PCR assays. Primer sequences of FGFR3 are
5’-ACAGCTCAGCTCCACAGCAT-3’ (forward) and
5’-GAGTCCTTGGGGACGGAG-3’ (reverse). Results
were expressed as the threshold cycle (Ct). Relative
quantification of target transcripts was determined by
the comparative Ct method (∆∆Ct) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Relative gene expression was
normalized to 18S and calculated by using the 2-∆∆Ct
method [53]. Control PCR experiments in the absence of
reverse transcription were performed to confirm that the
total RNA was not contaminated with genomic DNA.

Flow cytometric analysis
After drug treatment, the cells were harvested
by trypsinization, washed with PBS, then pellets
were resuspended and fixed in ethanol (70%, v/v) at
−20°C overnight, and washed once with PBS. After
centrifugation, the cells were incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature in 0.1 ml of phosphate-citric acid buffer.
Cells were stained with propidium iodide staining buffer
containing Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), RNase A (100 μg/
ml), and propidium iodide (80 μg/ml) for 30 minutes in
the dark. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

Transient transfection and Western blot analysis

LDH assay

The cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Silencer select siRNA against ERK was purchased from
Ambion. Plasmid expressing constitutively active Mek
(MEK-specific primer is 5′-ACCTTGAATACCACTCC-3′)
was prepared as described previously [52]. FGFR3
siRNAs and nonsense siRNA used as a control were
chemically synthesized (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). The
sequences of the sense strands were as follows: control
siRNA, 5′-GGCAAGAUUCUUCUCGUUGTT-3′; FGFR3
siRNA, 5′-GCCUUUACCUUUUAUGCAATT-3. The
expression and phosphorylation of c-Met and downstream
signaling factors were evaluated by Western blotting.
Briefly, cells were harvested, and lysed with ice-cold lysis
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Equivalent

Cells were treated with drugs at indicated
concentrations for 72 hours followed by the CytoTox 96
Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) at 490
nm to measure the levels of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase)
release according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Tumor xenograft model
This study was carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The protocol was approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of Wuxi People’s Hospital.

The IACUC committee members at Wuxi People’s
Hospital approved this study. All surgery was performed
under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were
made to minimize suffering. Female athymic nude mice of
4–5 weeks of age were purchased from Shanghai SLAC
Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and were
housed in the Animal Resource Facility. To determine
the antitumor activities of DE605 plus sorafenib in vivo,
exponentially growing PLC/PRF/5 cells (1.0×107 in 100
µl PBS) were injected subcutaneously in the right flank
of each mouse. As tumors became established, mice were
randomized to four groups that received the following
agents by gavage: (A) vehicle, (B) sorafenib (60 mg/kg,
po, qd), (C) DE605 (80 mg/kg, po, qd), and (D) DE605
plus sorafenib. Tumors were monitored twice weekly.
As previously described [54], tumor size was measured
on two axes with the aid of Vernier calipers and tumor
volume (mm3) was calculated using the formula: 1/2(L ×
W2) where L is the longest and W is the shortest axis. Mice
were euthanized at the end of the study and/or when tumor
size exceeded 2,000 mm3. For tumor growth inhibition
(TGI), the antitumor effects are calculated by dividing
the tumor volumes from treatment groups by those of
the control groups and multiplied by 100. The mice were
examined frequently for overt signs of any adverse, drugrelated side effects.

incubation with anti-Ki-67 antibody. After washing, the
sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary
antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin. The sections were further incubated with
2, 4-diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with
hematoxylin.

TUNEL assay for apoptotic cells

Sources of support

The type of cell death (necrosis/apoptosis) was
evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated deoxyuridine biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assay with an Apo-Direct kit (Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA) as previously reported [55]. Briefly, after antigen
retrieval, the tumor sections (4 µm-thick) were fixed
by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. The
permeabilized sections were incubated with terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase recombinant (rTdT) enzymecatalysed reaction and nucleotide mixture for 60 min at
37°C in the dark. After immersion in stop/wash buffer for
15 min at room temperature, the sections were washed
with PBS to remove unincorporated fluorescein-12-dUTP
and the nuclei counterstained with hematoxylin.
