ABSTRACT
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), the enzyme that produces sphingosine 1
phosphate (S1P), is known to be highly expressed in many cancers. However, the role
of SPHK1 in cells of the tumor stroma remains unclear. Here, we show that SPHK1 is
highly expressed in the tumor stroma of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC),
and is required for the differentiation and tumor promoting function of cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs). Knockout or pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 in
ovarian fibroblasts attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of CAF markers, and reduced
their ability to promote ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion in a coculture
system. Mechanistically, we determined that SPHK1 mediates TGF-β signaling via
the transactivation of S1P receptors (S1PR2 and S1PR3), leading to p38 MAPK
phosphorylation. The importance of stromal SPHK1 in tumorigenesis was confirmed
in vivo, by demonstrating a significant reduction of tumor growth and metastasis in
SPHK1 knockout mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of SPHK1
inhibition as a novel stroma-targeted therapy in HGSC.

spread [6, 8, 9]. However, the mechanisms by which
CAFs develop remain unclear. Identification of the
molecular mediators that facilitate CAF formation is
critical to the discovery of more effective therapies in
HGSC.
Sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2) are
homologous isoenzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation
of sphingosine to generate the bioactive metabolite
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Accumulating evidence
indicates that sphingolipid metabolism is altered in human
cancers and contributes to disease progression, metastasis,
and the development of chemoresistance [10–12].
Aberrant SPHK1 and SPHK2 activity has been implicated
in diverse malignant processes including neoplastic
transformation, proliferation, and migration in numerous
cancer types [10, 12–16]. Elevated levels of S1P have also
been observed in cancer, where S1P was shown to act both
as an intracellular second messenger and as a secreted

INTRODUCTION
High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is
the most common type of ovarian cancer and accounts
for the majority of disease-related mortality [1, 2].
One of the main reasons for high mortality is that most
ovarian cancer patients (~75%) present with widespread
metastasis at initial diagnosis [3, 4]. The metastatic
potential of many cancers, including ovarian, is largely
dependent on the bidirectional communication between
tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment [5,
6]. Ovarian cancers have a substantial stromal component
that can comprise up to 70% of the tumor [7]. A
predominant cell type in the tumor stroma is the cancerassociated fibroblast (CAF). CAFs secrete a milieu of
growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix
(ECM) components, which generate a microenvironment
that enhances tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastatic

ligand capable of activating a family of S1P-specific cell
surface G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5) [11, 17].
Whereas the impact of altered sphingolipid
metabolism has been extensively studied in tumor cells,
little is known about the role of the sphingosine kinases
and S1P-mediated signaling in the adjacent tumor stroma,
and more specifically CAFs. The formation of CAFs
shares several similarities with the process of tissue
fibrosis, which is characterized by the excessive deposition
of ECM by activated myofibroblasts [18, 19]. Studies in
models of organ fibrosis have provided insight into the
potential roles of SPHK1 in tumor stroma. In a model of
pulmonary fibrosis, S1P stimulated the differentiation of
normal lung fibroblasts to a pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts
state characterized by increased ECM deposition [20]. In a
model of cardiac fibrosis, SPHK1 expression in fibroblasts
was induced by TGF-β1 and fibroblast-specific inhibition
of SPHK1 attenuated TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast
activation [21]. TGF-β has been implicated in fibroblast
activation in a number of different cancer types, including
ovarian [8, 22]. Together, these studies suggest that
SPHK1 may be a critical mediator of differentiation and
TGF-β-induced activation of CAFs.
In the current study, we investigated whether SPHK1
mediates the differentiation of normal ovarian fibroblasts to
CAFs, thereby promoting tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer.
We confirmed that HGSCs have elevated levels of SPHK1
mRNA, and that SPHK1 is highly expressed by ovarian
cancer-associated stroma. Using an in vitro coculture
model, we found that ovarian cancer cells stimulated the
transition of fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts, and
induced stromal SPHK1 expression. We further showed
that knockout or pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 in
ovarian fibroblasts limited their activation by both cancer
cells and TGF-β1, attenuating their ability to promote
tumor cell migration and invasion. In summary, these data
indicate that SPHK1 contributes to ovarian cancer’s clinical
phenotype as a required mediator of CAF formation, and
may serve as a viable therapeutic target.

benign ovary (Bonome dataset) or fallopian tube (the
Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] dataset) (Supplementary
Figure S1B). High SPHK1 expression in tumors was
significantly associated with both poor progression-free
survival (p = 0.0001) and decreased overall survival (p =
0.0209) (Figure 1B).

SPHK1 is associated with a reactive stromal
signature and is highly expressed by the cancerassociated stroma
To identify the biological mechanism that could
explain the association of increased expression of SPHK1 and
poor survival, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment
analysis of the genes that positively correlated (R ≥ 0.6) with
SPHK1 in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS) and
TCGA datasets [23, 24]. Genes involved in collagen fibril
organization, ECM production and remodeling, cell adhesion,
and metalloendopeptidase (MMP) activity were enriched
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Tothill et al. classified tumors in the AOCS dataset
into six molecular subtypes by their gene expression
signatures (C1-C6), of which the C1 subtype was
characterized by extensive stromal desmoplasia and
associated with the poorest survival [23]. Our analysis
showed that SPHK1 mRNA was most highly expressed in
the C1 subtype (Figure 2B). To further analyze SPHK1 in
these molecular subtypes, we divided the AOCS dataset into
SPHK1-High and SPHK1-Low groups by median transcript
expression. Tumors that were classified as being of the
C1 subtype constituted 54% of cases in the SPHK1-High
group, but only 3.5% of cases in the SPHK1-Low group
(Figure 2C). The opposite pattern was observed in the C4
subtype, which was defined by a low stromal response
signature (Figure 2C). Similar analyses of the TCGA dataset
demonstrated that high SPHK1 expression was associated
with the mesenchymal subtype, which is thought to be
equivalent to the C1 subtype and is associated with the
poorest survival (Supplementary Figure S2A) [24].
Increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin
(αSMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are
frequently used to identify CAFs [22]. Transcript levels
of ACTA2 (the gene encoding αSMA) and FAP were
significantly higher in SPHK1-High tumors than in
SPHK1-Low tumors in both the AOCS and TCGA datasets
(Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting
that SPHK1 could be associated with an increased
abundance of CAFs in ovarian tumors. Evaluation of
SPHK1 expression in different laser-microdissected
ovarian tissue components (GSE40595) showed that
CAFs expressed significantly higher levels of SPHK1
than ovarian cancer cells (p=0.0002) or normal ovarian
surface epithelium (OSE, p=0.0003) (Figure 2E and
Supplementary Figure S3). We observed similar results
in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, normal ovarian
fibroblasts, and patient-derived omental fibroblasts and
CAFs (Supplementary Figure S4).

RESULTS
SPHK1 is overexpressed in serous ovarian
cancer and associated with poor survival
Previous studies have found elevated levels
of S1P in the serum and ascites of ovarian cancer
patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that expression
of SPHK1, the enzyme that produces S1P, would
also be altered in ovarian cancer. We observed
significantly higher expression of SPHK1 mRNA in
the tumor samples compared to the benign ovary
controls (p=0.0004) (Figure 1A). In contrast, mRNA
levels of SPHK2 were not significantly altered
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Publically-available
ovarian cancer datasets confirmed elevated SPHK1
mRNA expression in ovarian cancer compared to

Studies have shown that ovarian cancer cells are an
abundant source of TGF-β, a potent inducer of fibroblast
activation in cancer [8, 22, 25, 26]. To confirm that ovarian
cancer cells produce TGF-β, OVCAR3 and SKOV3
conditioned media were subjected to a TGF-β ELISA.
Both cell lines secreted detectable amounts of TGF-β
(Supplementary Figure S5D). To determine whether
induction of SPHK1 expression was mediated by TGF-β
produced by ovarian cancer cells, we stimulated TRS3
cells with ovarian cancer cell conditioned medium treated
with an anti-TGF-β antibody or an IgG control. AntiTGF-β treatment significantly inhibited CAF activation
relative to IgG control treated conditioned media (Figure
3D). To elucidate whether CAF activation is dependent
upon canonical TGF-β signaling via TGF-β receptors

(TGFBRs) and SMAD3, we pretreated the fibroblast cell
lines with either the TGF-β type I receptor inhibitors,
A83-01 or ALK5 inhibitor II’ or the SMAD3 inhibitor,
SIS3, before stimulating the cells with ovarian cancer cell
conditioned medium. TRS3 cells pretreated with A8301, ALK5 inhibitor II, and SIS3 had significantly lower
expression of SPHK1 and CAF markers than the vehicle
treated control (p < 0.05, Figure 3E and Supplementary
Figure S5E). This effect was also seen with A83-01 pretreatment of INOF cells (Supplementary Figure S5C).
TGF-β1 stimulation of TRS3 and INOF cells increased
SPHK1 mRNA expression by greater than two-fold
(p < 0.001, Figure 3F and Supplementary Figure S5F),
whereas no increase in SPHK2 mRNA was observed
(Supplementary Figure S6C). TGF-β1 also significantly
increased SPHK1 protein expression in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 3F and Supplementary Figure S5F).

increased, S1P levels were measured by ELISA after
TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 treated TRS3 and INOF cells
produced S1P at least four-fold greater than untreated
cells (Supplementary Figure S5G). In addition, TGF-β1
by itself was able induce a CAF-like phenotype in TRS3
and INOF cells (Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure
S5H), but this effect was abrogated by pretreatment
of the ovarian fibroblasts with A83-01 (Figure 3F and
Supplementary Figure S5H).

and after TGF-β1 treatment (Supplementary Figure
S5G). Overexpression of SPHK1 in ovarian fibroblasts
resulted in elevated basal and TGF-β1-induced protein
and mRNA expression of the CAF markers αSMA,
FAP, COL1A1, FN1, and FN-EDA (Figure 4A–4B).
Immunofluorescence staining confirmed increased
αSMA expression in TRS3-SPHK1 cells at both the
basal level and after TGF-β1 stimulation (Figure 4C and
quantified in Supplementary Figure S7A).
Myofibroblasts and CAFs are also characterized by
an increased motility and ECM contraction [6, 27]. Indeed,
TRS3-SPHK1 cells displayed increased migration (Figure
4D) and ~5% increase in gel contraction over TRS3GFP cells both with and without TGF-β1 stimulation
(Figure 4E–4F). As CAFs are ultimately defined by their
tumor promoting properties, we assessed the effect of
SPHK1 overexpression in fibroblasts on the migration
and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Both the
migration (~2-fold) and invasion (~4-fold) of OVCAR3
cells, and the migration (~1.25-fold) of SKOV3 cells,
were significantly enhanced by coculture with TRS3SPHK1 cells in comparison to control TRS3-GFP cells
(Figure 4G).

Overexpression of SPHK1 in fibroblasts
enhances myofibroblast differentiation and CAFlike function
Given that SPHK1 is induced during
myofibroblast differentiation and enriched in CAFs,
we sought to determine if overexpression of SPHK1
could enhance fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion
and promote CAF-like function. We generated TRS3
cell lines stably overexpressing SPHK1 (TRS3SPHK1) or GFP (TRS3-GFP) (Figure 4A). TRS3SPHK1 cells secreted increased levels of S1P relative
to TRS3-GFP cells under normal growth conditions

SPHK1 and S1PR2/3 signaling are required for
efficient myofibroblast differentiation and CAFlike function

β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and CAF-like
function were observed following SPHK1 knockout in the
INOF ovarian fibroblast cell line (Supplementary Figure
S8). To address whether pharmacological inhibition of
SPHK1 activity could reproduce SPHK1 knockout, we
utilized SKI-5C, a selective inhibitor of SPHK1 enzymatic
activity by binding to its active site [28]. Pharmacological
inhibition of SPHK1 activity by SKI-5C attenuated TGFβ1-induced expression of CAF markers and decreased
collagen gel contraction by ~19% (Figure 6A–6C). Similar
results were obtained in SKI-5C treated INOF cells
(Supplementary Figure S9A-B).
It is known that activated SPHK1 translocates
from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, leading to the
formation of S1P, which is subsequently exported from
the cell to act in both a paracrine and autocrine manner
via cell surface S1P receptors (S1PRs) [11, 17]. Studies
have shown that some of the downstream effects of
TGF-β1 are also mediated by S1PR signaling [29–31].
To determine whether the myofibroblastic differentiation
of ovarian fibroblasts is S1PR-mediated, we evaluated
the effect of S1PR inhibition on the ability of TGF-β1
to induce CAF-associated gene expression. In TRS3 and

To determine if SPHK1 is required for TGF-β1induced myofibroblast differentiation, we knocked out
SPHK1 in TRS3 cells (TRS3-sgSPHK1) via CRISPRCas9 (Figure 5A). SPHK1 knockout cells secreted
significantly less S1P in relative to control cells upon
TGF-β1 treatment (Supplementary Figure S5G). The
myofibroblastic phenotype was significantly attenuated
in TRS3-sgSPHK1 cells and TGF-β1 was ineffective in
inducing the expression of CAF markers (Figure 5A–5B).
Immunofluorescence staining in TRS3-sgSPHK1 cells
also confirmed a substantial decrease in the number of
αSMA+ cells following TGF-β1 stimulation (Figure 5C
and quantified in Supplementary Figure S7B). While
migration ability of TRS3-sgSPHK1 cells did not change,
their ability to contract collagen gels was decreased by
~ 14% in comparison to control cells (Figure 5D–5F).
Knockout of SPHK1 also altered the ability of TRS3 cells
to promote the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer
cells in vitro (Figure 5G). Similar deficiencies in TGF-

INOF cells, qRT-PCR analysis showed mRNA expression
of S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3, while S1PR4 and S1PR5
were not detected (Supplementary Figure S10A). To
ascertain which, if any, of these S1PRs were involved in
mediating TGF-β1 signaling, TRS3 and INOF cells were
stimulated with TGF-β1 in the presence of W146 (S1PR1
antagonist), JTE-013 (S1PR2 antagonist), or CAY10444
(S1PR3 antagonist). JTE-013 or CAY10444, but not
W146, significantly reduced the induction of CAF markers
by TGF-β1 (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure S9C).
We also found that TGF-β1 increases S1PR2 and S1PR3
mRNA (Supplementary Figure S10B), suggesting a feedforward activation role for S1PR2 and S1PR3, but not
S1PR1, in TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation.

However in TRS3 and INOF cells, TGF-β1-induced Smad
2/3 phosphorylation was not significantly altered between
control and SPHK1-knockout cells (data not shown),
suggesting that effects of SPHK1 on ovarian myofibroblast
differentiation are independent of Smad 2/3 signaling.
Because S1PR2 and S1PR3 were required for efficient
myofibroblast differentiation (Figure 6D), we investigated
the effect of SPHK1 knockout on several of the signaling
pathways that are downstream of these receptors,
including ERK, Rac, and p38 MAPK [11, 34]. No change
in the levels of activated phospho-ERK 1/2 or Rac1-GTP
were detected (data not shown), however TRS3-sgSPHK1
cells had markedly reduced activation of p38 MAPK
following TGF-β1 stimulation (Figure 7A). Reduced p38
MAPK activation by TGF-β1 was also observed in INOFsgSPHK1 cells (Supplementary Figure S11A). To confirm
p38 MAPK activation was indeed downstream of SPHK1
and S1PR2/3, we assessed the effect of S1PR inhibition on
TGF-β1-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Inhibition
of S1PR2, but not S1PR1 or S1PR3, resulted in diminished
levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Figure 7B). Further,
p38 MAPK activation was necessary for myofibroblast
differentiation as pharmacological inhibition using

cross-activate and enhance Smad signaling [32, 33].

SB203580 substantially inhibited the capacity of TGF-β1
to induce CAF-associated gene expression (Figure 7C and
Supplementary Figure S11B). To examine the importance
of S1P on TGF-β1-induced differentiation signals, we
investigated whether exogenous S1P rescued the TGF-β1
effect in SPHK1-knockout cells. Exogenous S1P treatment
rescued p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figure 7D) and
increased CAF-associated gene expression (Figure 7E
and Supplementary Figure S11C) in SPHK1-knockout
cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SPHK1,
S1P, and intact S1PR2/3 signaling are essential for TGFβ1-induced myofibroblast differentiation through their
regulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

Figures S5D and S12). MOSE-HRas cells were
injected intraperitoneally into female SPHK1-knockout

Sphk1-/- mice had significantly longer survival times than
Sphk1+/+ mice (p = 0.0446) (Figure 8A–8B) and exhibited
limited metastatic spread (Figure 8B–8C) suggesting
that a microenvironment deficient in Sphk1 may be less
proficient at promoting metastatic seeding. Overall, these
results indicate that the growth and seeding of ovarian
cancer cells are to some extent dependent on stromamediated paracrine signaling, and that SPHK1 expressed
in the stroma may be a major player in this process.

DISCUSSION

Loss of stromal SPHK1 expression alters
survival and tumor dissemination in a mouse
model of ovarian cancer

A majority of studies on SPHK1 have focused on
its role in tumor cells. In HGSC cells, overexpression
SPHK1 increased tumor cell proliferation, migration,
and the development of chemoresistance while its
knockdown or pharmacological inhibition resulted in
reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in vitro
[11, 35]. Targeting of SPHK1 or S1P in pre-clinical
mouse models of HGSC was also effective in inhibiting
tumor growth [35, 36]. However, recent reports utilizing
models of melanoma and colon cancer demonstrated that

To assess the effect of stromal SPHK1 expression
on ovarian cancer growth and metastasis in vivo, a
syngeneic mouse ovarian cancer cell line, MOSE-HRas
(p53-null HRas-MOSE, Agadjanian et al. in preparation)
was utilized. Similar to OVCAR3 and SKOV3, these cells
secrete a significant amount of TGF-β and activate TRS3
fibroblasts in a TGF-β dependent manner (Supplementary

expression of SPHK1 and S1P by the tumor stroma might
also be important in tumorigenesis [37, 38]. This study
is an initial investigation into the potentially significant
and unrecognized role of SPHK1 in the tumor stroma
of HGSC. The importance of the tumor stroma has long
been appreciated and it is now widely accepted that CAFs
are pivotal in supporting tumor growth, progression,
and invasion. Here, we show that endogenous fibroblast
SPHK1 expression is required for TGF-β-induced
myofibroblast differentiation and the acquisition of a CAFlike phenotype. The expression of SPHK1 is likely to be
clinically relevant, as we report that SPHK1 is enriched in
CAFs, and associated with a molecular subtype of HGSC
characterized by a reactive stroma signature and poor
prognosis.
Tumor cells secrete a variety of factors that induce
changes in the surrounding stroma. Multiple studies in
HGSC have demonstrated TGF-β to be the main driver
of fibroblast activation and subsequent CAF formation

[39–41]. Similarly, our data indicate that induction of
a CAF-like phenotype in fibroblasts by ovarian cancer
cells is mediated by TGF-β. Moreover, we show that
SPHK1 is coordinately induced by TGF-β1 during
this process. This finding is consistent with studies in
models of organ fibrosis where SPHK1 was shown to be
induced by TGF-β1 during myofibroblast differentiation
[21, 29]. To determine if SPHK1 was required for TGFβ1-mediated CAF activation, we knocked out SPHK1
in ovarian fibroblasts. Loss of SPHK1 in fibroblasts
abrogated the induction of myofibroblast markers
αSMA and FAP, and markedly diminished the ability of
fibroblasts to contract collagen gels or induce ovarian
cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings
are similar to those in studies in organ fibrosis, where
SPHK1 was also shown to be required for myofibroblast
activation and the secretion of ECM proteins [21,
29, 30]. However, we are the first to demonstrate
that stromal SPHK1 expression is required for the

myofibroblastic conversion and tumor-promoting
effects of CAFs.
Previous studies have found SPHK1, S1P, and
autocrine S1PR signaling to be crucial in facilitating
some of TGF-β’s downstream effects in myofibroblast
differentiation [29, 30, 42]. These studies identified
S1PR2 and/or S1PR3 as the key receptors in this
process and determined they stimulated either ERK
or Rho GTPase activity in a cell type specific manner
(myoblasts versus lung fibroblasts) [29, 42]. Our
data also confirmed the importance of S1PR2 in
myofibroblastic differentiation of CAFs; however we did
not find significant alterations in ERK or Rho GTPases.
Instead we found knockout or inhibition of SPHK1 to
result in reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Although
no studies have reported SPHK1 to activate p38 MAPK
in fibroblasts, several studies have found p38 MAPK to
be regulated by SPHK1 in other cell types [43–46]. In
further support of our findings, p38 MAPK activation
has been shown to be required for TGF-β-induced
myofibroblast differentiation in dermal and tenon
fibroblasts [47, 48]. A recent study also found p38 MAPK
to be a key mediator of CAF function, specifically in the
transcription and secretion of tumor-promoting growth
factors and cytokines [49].

Effective targeting of CAFs requires the
identification of factors and pathways that are necessary
in facilitating their formation. In this study, we identified
SPHK1, S1P, S1PR2, and p38 MAPK as essential
for the TGF-β-mediated induction of myofibroblastic
differentiation and the acquisition of a tumor-promoting
CAF phenotype. Pharmacological inhibitors to each of
these targets are readily available and some are already in
clinical trials for cancer or other diseases [50, 51]. While
further clinical investigation into the tolerability of these
agents in patients is warranted, we believe that targeting
SPHK1 and/or its downstream signaling machinery
in HGSC may be advantageous for two reasons. First,
whereas dysregulation of TGF-β signaling is recognized as
the main driver of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion
in cancer, targeting this pathway is difficult due to its
pleiotropic nature and carries the risk of adverse effects
in patients; targeting a downstream mediator of TGF-β
signaling such as SPHK1 should allow for more specific
inhibition of the tumor-promoting aspects of TGF-β
signaling [52, 53]. Second, SPHK1 inhibition would not
only target the tumor stroma, but would also have direct
effects on the tumor cells. Previous studies, as well as our
own preliminary findings (data not shown), demonstrate
that pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 in HGSC cell

lines induces cell death in vitro and reduces tumor growth
in vivo [35]. While SPHK1 inhibition may improve patient
outcome when combined chemotherapy, we hypothesize
that SPHK1 inhibition may be even more useful as a
consolidation or maintenance therapy by preventing
the formation of the microenvironment required for the
reemergence of HGSC. Using SPHK1 inhibitors in this
manner would be similar to how the anti-VEGF antibody
bevacizumab is currently used in some HGSC patients and
has resulted in significant improvements in progressionfree survival [54].
In summary, the current study suggests a novel
role for SPHK1 in the activation and tumor-promoting
role of CAFs. These data support a model in which
ovarian cancer cells induce stromal SPHK1 expression
via TGF-β, leading to inside-out S1P signaling through
the S1PR2 receptor and the activation of p38 MAPK.
Whereas targeting of TGF-β signaling is therapeutically
challenging, inhibiting a downstream effector SPHK1
could be a promising therapeutic strategy aimed at the
tumor stroma. This is significant for advanced stage HGSC
as it is rarely cured by conventional chemotherapies.

The TRS3 cell line was derived from normal ovary and
immortalized with SV40 T antigen [41]. The hTERTimmortalized normal ovarian fibroblast cell line INOFtdTomato has been described [55]. All ovarian cancer cell
lines were maintained in DMEM (Corning) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), PlasmocinTM (2.5 μg/
ml, Invivogen), and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (GIBCO)
unless otherwise indicated. The TRS3 and INOF cell lines
were maintained in a 1:1 ratio of MCDB 105 (SigmaAldrich) and Medium 199 (GIBCO) with 10% or 15%
FBS, respectively, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For
conditioned media or TGF-β1 stimulation, 3×105 TRS3 or
INOF cells were seeded in 6-well plates, serum starved
overnight, and then stimulated for the indicated time.
Unless otherwise noted, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL
of TGF-β1. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 1 hour
before TGF-β1 stimulation. Generation of conditioned
media is described in Supplementary Methods.

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analyses
For OpenArray Real-Time PCR, total RNA (2μg)
was extracted from snap-frozen tumors using TRI Reagent
(Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and reverse transcribed
using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems). cDNA was mixed with TaqMan
OpenArray Real-Time Mix (Applied Biosystems) and
loaded onto OpenArray Real-Time PCR plates containing
the probes for SPHK1 (Hs00184211_m1), SPHK2
(Hs01016543_g1), and internal control large ribosomal
protein P0 (RPLP0, Hs99999902_m1). The qRT-PCR
reactions were performed by the Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center Genomics Core using the BioTrove OpenArray
NT Cycler System and data were analyzed using the 2−ΔCT
method. After coculture of GFP-labeled ovarian cancer
cells with ovarian fibroblasts, cells were separated by
FACS in PBS with 0.5% BSA and RNA was extracted.
For all other qRT-PCR analyses, RNA extraction was
performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Quantitect Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen). For qRT-PCR, 50 ng of cDNA
was mixed with the appropriate primers and the iQ SYBRGreen Supermix (BioRad), and run on the CFX96 RealTime System (BioRad). Data were analyzed using the 2−
ΔCT
method. All mRNA data were normalized to RPL32
expression. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S3.

2000 (Invitrogen). Cell medium was changed to DMEM
supplemented with 30% FBS following overnight
incubation. After 48 hours, cell medium was harvested and
filtered using a 0.45 μm filter syringe. The viral supernatant
was used with Polybrene (8 μg/ml) to transduce TRS3 and
INOF cells lines. Cells were infected for 48 hours, following
which polyclonal populations of cells were selected with
puromycin (5 μg/ml) for at least 72 hours.

Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed with PBS,
and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% methanol for 10
minutes at −20°C. The coverslips were then blocked
with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature. This was followed by incubation with
primary antibody for 1 hour at 37°C or overnight at
4°C depending on the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Antibodies included αSMA (Abcam ab5694) and FN
detecting total fibronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
sc-9068). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated
with the appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary
antibody (1:1000 dilution; Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37°C.
The coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Labs).

Clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated gene
knockout
Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed using
the CRISPR Design Tool maintained by the Zhang Lab
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (http://crispr.
mit.edu/) to target the third coding exon of human SPHK1
(Supplementary Table S3). sgRNAs were cloned into the
LentiCRISPR V1 plasmid (Zhang Lab, Addgene Plasmid
49535) as previously described [56]. Transfection and
viral supernatant collection were performed as described
above. TRS3 and INOF cells were infected for 48 hours,
following which polyclonal populations of cells were
maintained with puromycin (5 μg/ml). Insertion of indels
was confirmed using the GeneArt® Genomic Cleavage
Detection Kit (Invitrogen) per the manufacture’s protocol.
When necessary, single clones were isolated using limiting
dilution.

Transwell migration and invasion assays
For fibroblast migration, 1×105 cells/mL were
seeded in serum-free media onto 24-well Transwell
inserts with 8.0 μm PET membranes (Merck Millipore).
Media containing 10% FBS or 0% FBS were added to the
bottom well as a chemoattractant and negative control,
respectively. Migrated cells at 6 hours were fixed and
stained with the Diff-Quik stain set (Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics) and counted in four different fields under an
Olympus BX43 upright microscope. For ovarian cancer
cell migration and invasion, cancer cells were cocultured
for 48 hours with TRS3 or INOF cells using 0.4 μm
Transwell inserts. After priming, ovarian cancer cells were
seeded at 1×105 cells/mL in serum-free media onto 24-well
Transwell inserts with 8 μm PET membranes or Biocoat
Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). Media
containing 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant.
Migrated cells at 6 hours or invaded cells at 48 hours were
fixed and stained with the Diff-Quik stain set and counted
in four different fields. The experiments were performed
in triplicate wells and each experiment was performed at
least two or three times as indicated.

Western blot analyses and antibodies
Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA
lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein
concentrations of cell lysates were determined by the BCA
protein assay (Pierce). 30-50 μg of lysate were loaded
onto a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and
subjected to gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were
transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) using the
Trans-Blot® TurboTM transfer system (Bio-Rad) at 25V
for 10 minutes. Membranes were then blocked in Odyssey
Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor) or 5% non-fat dry milk in
TBS-T for 1 hour and then incubated with the appropriate
antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibodies included: αSMA
(Abcam ab5694), FAP (Abcam ab53066), FN detecting
total fibronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-9068),
FN [IST-9] detecting only FN-EDA (Abcam ab6328),
GAPDH (Fitzgerald Industries 10R-G109a; Acton, MA),
p38α MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology (CST) #9217),
phospho-p38 MAPK (CST #9211), SPHK1 (CST #12071),
and SPHK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-22704).
Following overnight incubation at 4°C, the membranes
were washed with TBS-T and then incubated with the
appropriate IRDye ® secondary antibody (Li-Cor) for
1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed
with TBS-T and the membrane signal was subsequently
analyzed by the Li-Cor Odyssey system.

Collagen gel contraction assay
Cell culture dishes were coated with 1% BSA and
incubated for 1 hour at 37°C to inhibit the collagen gels
from attaching to the dishes. Collagen gels were prepared
by mixing cell suspensions in 2X MCD105:199 medium
with a neutralized solution of rat tail collagen type I matrix
(9 parts collagen to 1 part neutralization buffer; Advanced
BioMatrix #5153-A). The cell-collagen concentrations
were adjusted with sterile PBS to attain a final collagen
concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and a final cell concentration
of 3×105 cells/mL. The cell-collagen suspension was then
added to the pretreated culture dishes and allowed to
polymerize for 1 hour at 37°C. Serum-free medium with
or without TGF-β1 was added to the solidified collagen

Animal studies
All animal procedures were performed in accordance
with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. Sphk1-deficient (Sphk1-/-; B6N.129S6Sphk1tm1RIp/J) mice were obtained from Jackson
Laboratory (stock number 019095).[57] Six week-old
female SPHK1-deficient (Sphk1-/-) and littermate-matched
wild type (Sphk1+/+) controls were intraperitoneally
injected with 5×106 p53-null-HRas-mouse ovarian surface
epithelial (MOSE) cells (Agadjanian et al. in preparation)
in 200 μL of serum-free media. For survival studies,
mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by
cervical dislocation when morbid ascites developed or
according to predefined criteria in order to avoid animal
suffering. Tumor tissue, if present, was harvested and
processed for subsequent hemotoxylin and eosin and
