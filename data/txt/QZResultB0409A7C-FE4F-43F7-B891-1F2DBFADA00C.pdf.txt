Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer research has been righteously and successfully focused on prevention, early detection and
identification of specific molecular targets that distinguish the malignant cells from the
neighboring benign cells1. However, a major clinical challenge concerns how we can reduce lethal
tissue injury caused by intensive chemoradiotherapy during treatment of late-staged metastatic
cancers. Here we tested whether induction of adult stem cells repairs chemoradiation-induced
tissue injury and prolongs overall survival. We found that intestinal stem cells (ISCs)2 expressed
Slit2 and its single-span transmembrane cell-surface receptor Roundabout 1 (Robo1)3,4. Partial
genetic deletion of Robo1 decreased intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and caused villus hypotrophy,
whereas Slit2 transgene increased ISCs and triggered villus hypertrophy. During lethal dosages of
chemoradiation, administering a short pulse of R-spondin 1 (Rspo1; a Wnt agonist)5–14 plus Slit2
reduced ISC loss, mitigated gut impairment and protected animals from death, without
concomitantly decreasing tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Rspo1 and Slit2 may thus act as
therapeutic adjuvants to enhance host tolerance to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for eradicating
metastatic cancers.

We found, by two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), that Slit2 and Robo1
mRNAs not only co-localized, but also were expressed in markedly higher amounts in the
crypts when compared to the villi in the small intestines of adult C57BL/6 (Wt) mice (Fig.
1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Ki67+-transient amplifying (TA) cells and LGR5+-ISCs
expressed Slit2 and Robo1 mRNAs (Fig. 1b, c). In contrast, neither Slit2 nor Robo1 mRNA
was visible in lysozyme+-Paneth cells. Using the intestinal specimens harvested from
LGR5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 (LGR5-GFP) mice15, we confirmed that Slit2 and Robo1

mRNAs were expressed by GFPhigh-ISCs at the bottom of the crypt (Fig. 1d). The
distribution of Slit2 and Robo1 is apparently higher at the crypts than in the villi of the small
intestine, which mirrors the well-characterized gradient of active β-catenin in the crypt-villus
axis16.

Complete or partial genetic deletion of Robo1 is embryonic lethal while mice with partial
genetic deletion of both Robo1 and 2 are viable17,18. Thus, we examined the intestinal
morphology in Robo1/2 double heterozygotes (Robo1+/−; Robo2+/− or Robo1/2 mutants).
Robo1/2 mutants displayed reduced expression of Robo1 protein, but not Slit2 or α–tubulin
(tub; Supplementary Fig. 2a). Notably, Robo2 mRNA was not detectable in the Wt small
intestine, even though it clearly was present in the cerebellum (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Compared to Wt littermates, Robo1/2 mutants had noticeably sparser, shorter and floppier
villi throughout the entire small intestine (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 3a), displaying
markedly fewer Ki67+-TA cells (Fig. 2b), LGR5+-ISCs (Fig. 2c), villin+-enterocytes (Fig.
2d), and a reduced number of proliferating intestinal cells visualized by bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) staining (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The mutant animals also had a higher level of
endotoxin (Supplementary Fig. 5), a functional indicator of intestinal impairment13.
Importantly, Robo1 single heterozygotes (Robo1+/− or Robo1 mutant) phenocopied the
Robo1/2 double heterozygotes (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d), whereas no such alterations were
detected in the intestines of Robo2 single heterozygotes (Robo2+/− or Robo2 mutant;
Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). We also isolated intestinal crypts from Robo1/2 mutants and
found that Robo1+/−/2+/− crypts failed to form intestinal organoids, also called mini-guts or
enteroids5–8, as compared to their Wt littermates (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 8a for
enlarged images). The expression of LGR5, CD133, Sox9, Bmi1 and mTert mRNAs as ISC
markers19 was significantly reduced in the Robo1/2 mutant intestines relative to their Wt
counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 9a). As Slit-Robo signaling re-models neovasculature3
and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition4, we examined and found no aberrant
localization and distribution of CD31+-vascular endothelial cells in the vasculatures,
including those distributing alongside the TA compartment and the capillary bed in the villi
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, d), or of α-smooth muscle actin+-intestinal smooth muscle cells
(Supplementary Fig. 11a) in the intestines of Robo1/2 mutants as compared to their Wt
littermates. These data collectively indicate that the Slit2-Robo1 interaction induces ISCs
during physiologic maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

To complement our genetic findings, we used R5, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds
to Robo1, but not Robo2–4, and neutralizes Slit2 binding to Robo13,4. Wt mice were treated
daily for 6 days with an intraperitoneal injection of isotype-matched irrelevant mouse IgG
(mIgG) or R5. As expected, R5, but not mIgG, reduced intestinal villus size (Supplementary
Fig. 12a) and number (Supplementary Fig. 3b), decreased the numbers of Ki67+-TA cells
(Supplementary Fig. 12b), LGR5+-ISCs (Supplementary Fig. 12c), villin+-enterocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 12d) and BrdU+-intestinal cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b), without
concomitantly affecting the distributions of vascular endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
10b, e) and smooth muscle cells (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Compared to mIgG, R5 potently
inhibited the in vitro formation of intestinal organoids5–8 isolated from Wt mice

We next asked whether ectopically expressed Slit2 (Robo1 ligand) might augment ISCs and
their daughter cells, leading to villus hypertrophy. To this end, we examined the intestinal
phenotypic changes in Slit2 transgenic (Slit2-Tg) mice driven by the pCMV promoter for
efficient, but non-selective expression of human Slit2 transgene20. As compared to Wt mice,
Slit2-Tg mice displayed an increased mosaic expression of Slit2 protein, but not Robo1 orα–
tubulin (tub), in the small intestines (Supplementary Fig. 2b). When compared to Wt mice,
Slit2-Tg mice had noticeably thicker, longer, enlarged and outnumbered villi (Fig. 3a,
Supplementary Fig. 3c), with increased numbers of Ki67+-TA cells (Fig. 3b), LGR5+-ISCs
(Fig. 3c), BrdU+-intestinal cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c) and villin+-enterocytes (Fig. 3d),
without concomitantly affecting the distribution of CD31+-vascular endothelial cells
(Supplementary Fig. 10c, f) or α-smooth muscle actin+-smooth muscle cells (Supplementary
Fig. 11c). The compartment of Ki67+-TA cells appeared to be enlarged, which could be
caused by accelerated proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 4c) and/or aberrant directional
migration of TA cells triggered by Slit-Robo signaling3,4. Notably, the intestinal crypts
isolated from Slit2–Tg mice formed more and larger intestinal organoids5–8 relative to their
Wt counterparts (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Fig. 8c for enlarged images). Compared to Wt
mice, the expression of LGR5, CD133, Sox9, Bmi1 and mTert mRNAs19 (Supplementary
Fig. 9c) was significantly augmented in the small intestine of Slit2-Tg mice. Taken together,
our results indicate the functional significance of Slit-Robo signaling in intestinal
regeneration through modulation of ISCs.

We further tested whether recombinant Slit2 (rSlit24) could substitute and potentiate
recombinant Rspo1 (rRspo1; Supplementary Fig. 13a) for inducing intestinal organoids in
vitro. As predicted, rSlit2 acted synergistically with rRspo1 to promote in vitro formation
and growth of intestinal organoids in terms of their number and size (Supplementary Figs.
14a, 8d for enlarged images). In the absence of rRspo1 (rRspo1-), rSlit2 alone, at 0.5 or 1
µg/ml, was capable of inducing intestinal organoids. The intestinal crypts isolated from
Slit2-Tg mice also formed intestinal organoids without added rRspo1 or rSlit2. Using single
cell sorting gated for GFP5, we isolated GFPhigh-ISCs from LGR5-GFP mice15 and found
that rSlit2 by itself induced intestinal organoids (Supplementary Figs. 14b, 8e for enlarged
images). More importantly, rSlit2 acted cooperatively with rRspo1 in the formation of
intestinal organoids in vitro. To further demonstrate whether Slit2 could induce the selfrenewal and pluripotential capacities of ISCs, we performed serial passages (up to 4
passages; every two weeks for each passage) of cultured intestinal organoids and found that
rSlit2 not only substituted for rRspo1, but also functioned synergistically with rRspo1, using
both the isolated Wt intestinal crypts (Supplementary Fig. 15a) and the sorted GFPhigh-ISCs
(Supplementary Fig. 15b).
Considering that LGR5 is a specific ISC marker15 and a direct targeting gene of canonical
Wnt signaling2,5–8, we treated LGR5-GFP mice with mIgG and R5 and found that compared
to untreated (normal) or mIgG-treated LGR5-GFP mice, R5 inhibited the number of
GFPhigh-ISCs (~50% inhibition; Supplementary Fig. 16a). Compared to untreated LGR5GFP mice, treatment with rRspo1 plus rSlit2 increased the number of GFPhigh-ISCs (~30%

increase; Supplementary Fig. 16b). Treatment with rRspo1 or rSlit2 alone also slightly
augmented the number of GFPhigh-ISCs. Our results thus provide in vivo evidence for the
biological importance of our newly discovered Slit2 and Rspo1 cooperation in induction of
ISCs and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

We also tested the functional significance of Robo1 in Rspo1-induced intestinal repair in
vivo. Consistent with previous reports9–14, intravenous administration of rRspo1 potently
promoted villus growth in the Wt jejunum (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Surprisingly, rRspo1
(0.1 mg/mouse/day for 5 days) failed to accelerate growth of intestinal epithelial cells in
Robo1/2 mutants. Compared to their rRspo1-treated Wt counterparts, rRspo1 also failed to
significantly augment the numbers of LGR5+-ISCs (Supplementary Fig. 17b) and Ki67+-TA
cells (Supplementary Fig. 17c) in the jejunum crypts of Robo1+/−; Robo2+/− mice. A
prolonged pulse of rRspo1 (0.1 mg/mouse/day for 10 days) further robustly enhanced crypt
size (Supplementary Fig. 18a) and augmented the numbers of Ki-67+-TA cells
(Supplementary Fig. 18b), BrdU+-intestinal cells (Supplementary Fig. 18c) and LGR5+ISCs (Supplementary Fig. 18d) in Wt littermates, but not in Robo1/2 mutants. As predicted,
treatment of Wt littermates with rRspo1 markedly induced the cytoplasmic and nuclear
translocation of β-catenin (Supplementary Fig. 19a) and elevated the expression of c-Myc
(Supplementary Fig. 19b) as compared to Robo1/2 mutants.

Stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with Rspo1 can ameliorate 5-FU and radiationinduced gut damage, including radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS)9–13.
Relatedly, we found that the therapeutic dosage of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)9, a wellcharacterized chemotherapy medicine, drastically shortened the villus length
(Supplementary Fig. 20a) and reduced the numbers of LGR5+-ISCs (Supplementary Fig.
20b) and Ki67+-TA cells (Supplementary Fig. 20c) in the Wt jejunum, but not in the Slit2Tg jejunum. These findings attest to the functional significance of Slit2 for promoting
chemotherapy-induced intestinal repair.

Considering our findings that Slit2 potentiated Rspo1-induced ISCs and synergized with
Rspo1 for reducing chemotherapy-induced gut injury, we asked whether Slit2, in
combination with Rspo1, could induce ISCs and consequently prolong overall survival in
mice receiving lethal challenges of chemoradiation. To our surprise, in mice with the Slit2
transgene, there was a 70% survival rate in mice receiving a lethal dose of 5-FU21, whereas
this same dosage caused the death of all Wt mice within two weeks (Fig. 4a). The lethal
dose of 5-FU abolished >90% GFPhigh-ISCs (Supplementary Fig. 21a). However, a 3-day
treatment of rSlit2 or rRspo1 alone protected ~40% GFPhigh-ISCs. Most exciting was the
finding that the same regiment of rRspo1 plus rSlit2 preserved ~80% GFPhigh-ISCs. Our
findings thus indicate that Slit2 acts synergistically with Rspo1 for cooperative induction of
ISCs, leading to prolongation of overall survival in response to the lethal dose of
chemotherapy.
Because aberrant Wnt signaling causally contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis2, because
Slit2 and Robo1 expression inversely correlates with the overall survival rate in colorectal
cancer4, and because recurrent gene fusion of Rspo2 and 3 contributes to colorectal
cancer22, we explored whether a short 3-day pulse of rSlit2 and/or rRspo1 could accelerate

the development of intestinal carcinogenesis and/or decrease its sensitivity to
chemoradiotherapy. To test this, ApcMIN/+ mice with spontaneous intestinal adenoma were
treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce inflammation related intestinal
carcinogenesis, a murine model that is thought to closely mimic multi-factorial human
colorectal cancer23. Treatment of DSS-treated ApcMIN/+ mice with rSlit2 or rRspo1 alone
led to a 20–30% survival rate upon the lethal dosage of 5-FU (Fig. 4b). Importantly, a
combination of rSlit2 and rRspo1 led to a 60% survival rate (p=0.0023 between the rRspo1
plus rSlit2 group compared to either group alone), demonstrating the functional cooperation
between Slit2 and Rspo1 leading to increased host tolerance to the lethal dose of
chemotherapy in this murine model of carcinogenesis.

Consistent with previous reports using recombinant flagellin in xenografted mouse sarcoma
and malignant melanoma24 and adenoviral Rspo1 in xenografted human colorectal
carcinoma12, neither acceleration of intestinal cancer development nor desensitization to 5FU chemotherapy was detected with our rRspo1 and rSlit2 combination treatment (Fig. 4c).
In contrast, upon administration of rRspo1 and rSlit2, a single “lethal” dose of 5-FU
drastically eliminated the number of intestinal tumors, suggesting that Rspo1 plus Slit2
treatment may act as adjuvants before, during or after intensive chemotherapy for cancer
eradication.

Furthermore, the combination of rSlit2 plus rRspo1 led to a 30% survival rate in mice
receiving a lethal dose of whole body irradiation (WBI; Fig. 4d) and a 50% survival rate in
mice receiving a lethal dose of abdominal irradiation (AIR; Fig. 4h). We also observed
concomitant prolongations of the villus length (Fig. 4e, i), augmentations of LGR5+-ISCs
(Fig. 4f, j) and Ki67+-TA cells (Fig. 4g, k) in the jejunum, which are in analogous to
previous finding that LGR5+-ISCs in the small intestine are resistant to radiation25.
Mechanistically, although the lethal dose of WBI abolished >80% GFPhigh-ISCs
(Supplementary Fig. 21b), a 3-day treatment of rRspo1 or rSlit2 alone protected ~40%
GFPhigh-ISCs while rRspo1 plus rSlit2 preserved >80% GFPhigh-ISCs in LGR5-GFP mice.
In summary, our study indicates that Slit2 and Rspo1 cooperatively induce ISCs for
intestinal homeostasis and repair and significantly prolong overall survival following lethal
doses of chemoradiotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, the combined Slit2/Rspo1
treatment, used as an adjuvant approach, is the first example to demonstrate the feasibility of
inducing endogenous adult tissue-specific stem cells for organ and tissue repair with farreaching medical impact.

heterozygotes that were not embryonically lethal. Notably, we have never obtained any
viable Robo1−/− homozygotes after multiple trials. Slit2-Tg mice were generated and
characterized as described20. Male and female mice were equally divided without
randomization. They were used at 8 weeks old unless specifically indicated. For
measurement of cell proliferation, mice were injected with BrdU (1 mg/100 grams of body
weight) for 2 h prior to sacrifice. For antibody treatment, Wt mice were injected
intraperitoneally with isotype-matched irrelevant mIgG or R5 monoclonal Ab3,4 (1 mg/
mouse/day for 6 consecutive days). For induction of inflammation-related intestinal
carcinogenesis, ApcMIN/+ mice were treated with 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in
drinking water for one week and were used experimentally two weeks later23. For
“chemoradiation” experiments, Wt and DSS-treated ApcMIN/+ mice (10 weeks old) were
injected intravenously with Slit2 or Rspo1 alone or in combination (0.1 mg/mouse/day for 3
consecutive days). On day 2, they were given 5-FU intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/mouse/day
for 5 days for the therapeutic dose9 or 300 mg/kg once for the lethal high dose21) or were
irradiated (10.4 Gy/mouse once for WBI or 12 Gy/mouse once for AIR12). Alternatively,
Slit2-Tg mice20 (10 weeks old) were given the lethal high dose of 5-FU intraperitoneally
(300 mg/kg once21). Tissue sections of small intestines were stained with hematoxylin &
eosin (H&E) and the relative villus sizes and numbers at the duodenum, jejunum and ileum
were double-blindly measured. The length ratios of 1:3:2 of the entire small intestine were
defined as the duodenum, jejunum and ileum26, respectively. Serum LPS levels were
measured using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Lonza). Mouse experiments were
approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) of the
University of Michigan.

In vitro culture of intestinal crypts

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The intestinal crypts of mouse small intestines were isolated28 and cultured in vitro5–8.
Specifically, mouse ileums (~6 cm) were dissected out of the animals, flushed with ice-cold
sterile PBS, cut open lengthwise and into 1 cm pieces, and transferred into the Petri dish
with ice-cold sterile PBS supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen). This step was
repeated twice. They were then transferred to a 50-ml conical tube containing 30 ml of icecold sterile shaking buffer (PBS supplemented with 15 mM EDTA and 1% Pen/Strep) and
rocked in the cold room for 30 minutes, then vortexed at maximal speed for a total of 2
minutes in 30 second intervals. The shaking buffers containing separated crypts were filtered
through a 70-μm filter into a new 50-ml conical tube, counted, transferred to a round-bottom
tube (500 crypts/tube), and centrifuged at 200g at 4°C for 10 minutes. After gently removing
the supernatant, the crypt pellets were resuspended in 20 µl of the gut media [Advanced
DMEM/F12, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep, 10 μM HEPES (all from Invitrogen), 1% N2
supplement (R&D Systems), 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 µg/ml rRspo1
(Supplementary Fig. 13b), 0.1 µg/ml rNoggin (Supplementary Fig. 14b), 0.1 µg/ml EGF
(R&D Systems), 0.1 µg/ml rWnt3a (R&D Systems), or 0.5 or 1 µg/ml rSlit24]. These crypts
were mixed with ice-cold 50 µl Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and plated onto one well of the
24-well cell culture plate, using a pre-chilled pipette tip. The plate was placed in the 37°C
incubator for 30 minutes and an aliquot of 0.5 ml gut media was overlaid. The media was
replaced every 2–4 days.

Isolation and cell sorting of GFP-positive ISCs expressing LGR5-GFP was performed
according to the previous publication10. Specifically, the small intestinal crypts of LGR5GFP mice were isolated and dissociated with TrypLE express (Invitrogen) and 2,000 U/ml
DNase (Sigma Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 min. Dissociated cells were passed through a 20-μm
cell strainer and washed with sterile PBS. GFPhigh-ISCs were isolated using Moflo cell
sorter. An aliquot of 10,000 sorted GFPhigh-ISCs were suspended in 20 µl gut media, mixed
well with 50 µl Matrigel, and transferred to one well of 24-well plate. The plate was placed
in the 37°C incubator for 30 minutes and an aliquot of 0.5 ml gut media supplemented with
Y-27632 (10 μM, to prevent anoikis; Sigma Aldrich) was overlaid. The efficiency of
organoids generation from isolated GFPhigh-ISCs was ~3%, which was similar to the
previous reports5,29. Indicated growth factors were added every other day and the entire
medium was changed every 4 days. For serial passage, the cultured intestinal organoids were
removed from the Matrigel culture and mechanically dissociated into the single crypt
domains. After mixing with gut media and Matrigel, they were transferred to the new well
and an aliquot of 0.5 ml gut media was overlaid. This procedure was repeated during a two
week period, without loss of replicating efficiency.

All mouse RT2 qPCR primer pairs were purchased from SA Biosciences. The crypts of
mouse small intestine were isolated28 for qRT-PCR as previously described4. Notably, we
routinely isolated less amounts of total mRNAs from the atrophied Robo1+/−/2+/− and R5treated intestines and more amounts of total mRNAs from the hypertrophied Slit2-Tg
intestines than the Wt intestines (data not shown). However, the adjusted amounts of total
isolated mRNAs were used as the starting materials in the identical quantity for the purpose
of comparison.
Immunoblotting

The isolated intestinal crypts were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4
(PBS) and lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer [50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 15
µg/ml benzamidine, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10%
glycerol] at 4°C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min at 4°C. Samples
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore) and
detected with appropriate primary Abs followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). The blotting signals were detected using
SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Quantitative analyses of
immunoblotting signals on Fuji Films were obtained by densitometry analysis using
LAS4000 Image Software. Notably, we routinely isolated less amounts of total proteins
from the atrophied Robo1+/−; Robo2+/− and R5-treated intestines and more amounts of total
proteins from the hypertrophied Slit2-Tg intestines than the Wt intestines (data not shown).
However, the adjusted amounts of total isolated proteins were used as the starting materials

Rspo1 and noggin were digested with NotI/EcoRI. They were ligated into the pVL1392
vector (BD Pharmingen).
Recombinant Rspo1 and Noggin were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus
expression system (BaculoGold; BD Pharmingen) and purified to homogeneity from the
serum-free supernatant of Sf9 cells infected with their respective viral stocks (MOI ~2
×108/ml) by Talon metal affinity chromatography (BD Clontech)30. Endotoxin levels of
these isolated recombinant proteins were <0.1 unit/mg of proteins measured by
limulusamoebocyte lysate (LAL) from Cape Cod.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

The experimental data were statistically analyzed by Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and analyzed by a log rank test. The p value
less than 0.05 or 0.01 was considered statistically significant or very significant,
respectively.

Figure 1. Expression of Slit2 and Robo1 in mouse small intestine

Author Manuscript

a, Expression and co-localization of Slit2 and Robo1 mRNAs in the crypts of small
intestine. Slit2 and Robo1 mRNAs in the Wt small intestines were detected by using the
DIG- or biotin-conjugated antisense Slit2 and Robo1 mRNA probes. Slides were
counterstained with DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were observed under a laser scanning
confocal microscope, and the recorded fluorescent images were then merged. b–d, Cellular
distribution of mRNAs for Slit2 (b and d) and Robo1 (c and d). Slit2, Robo1, Ki67 (a
marker for proliferating TA cells), LGR5 (a marker for ISCs), and lysozyme (a marker for
Paneth cells) were found at the crypt of small intestines using FISH (Slit2 and Robo1) and
immunofluorescent staining with their respective Abs (Ki67, LGR5 and lysozyme).
Alternatively, the intestinal tissues isolated from LGR5-GFP mice were stained by the antiGFP Ab to detect GFPhigh-cells (d). White arrows indicate LGR5+-cells (a–c) and GFPhighcells (d) co-localized with Slit2 or Robo1 mRNA. Results represent at least three separate
experiments (five mice/group; 8 weeks old). Bars, 50 µm for a–d.
