Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells form three dimensional (3D) multicellular aggregates (or spheroids) under nonadherent culture conditions. In ovarian cancer (OC), spheroids serve as a vehicle for cancer cell
dissemination in the peritoneal cavity, protecting cells from environmental stress-induced anoikis.
To identify new targetable molecules in OC spheroids, we investigated gene expression profiles
and networks upregulated in three dimensional (3D) versus traditional monolayer culture
conditions. We identified ALDH1A1, a cancer stem cell marker as being overexpressed in OC
spheroids and directly connected to key elements of the β-catenin pathway. B-catenin function and
ALDH1A1 expression were increased in OC spheroids vs. monolayers and in successive spheroid
generations, suggesting that 3D aggregates are enriched in cells with stem cell characteristics. Bcatenin knockdown decreased ALDH1A1 expression levels and β-catenin coimmunoprecipitated
with the ALDH1A1 promoter, suggesting that ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin target. Both siRNA
mediated β-catenin knockdown and A37, a novel ALDH1A1 small molecule enzymatic inhibitor
described here for the first time, disrupted OC spheroid formation and cell viability (p<0.001). Bcatenin knockdown blocked tumor growth and peritoneal metastasis in an OC xenograft model.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies; with the
majority of cases being diagnosed at an advanced stage. OC metastasis is the primary cause
of clinical complications and is characterized by several unique features (1). While in other
epithelial tumors breakdown of the basement membrane is required for tumor invasion into
lymphatics or vasculature and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells to distant sites (2),
hematogenous metastasis is uncommon in OC. Tumor dissemination occurs directly in the
peritoneal cavity; with most sites of secondary implants involving the mesentery, omentum,
and bowel. This is facilitated by the fact that OC cells at the primary site are in direct
anatomic contact with the overlying peritoneal surface and fluid. Their dislodgement from
the primary tumor on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube (3), allows cells to float in
the peritoneal fluid. Importantly, after exfoliation from the primary tumor, OC cells form
multicellular aggregates or spheroids (4). These 3D cellular aggregates serve as the vehicle
for dissemination in the peritoneal cavity, protecting cells from anoikis induced by stress in
the extracellular compartment (5, 6).

Author Manuscript

Within spheroid structures, cells adopt mesenchymal features (4, 7) that are regulated by
cytokines and growth factors such as estrogen (8), TGF-β (9), or other proteins secreted in
the peritoneal milieu (10, 11). The mesenchymal phenotype allows cells to invade when they
come in contact with the mesothelium (7), leading to the establishment of peritoneal
implants. We hypothesized that cells forming spheres are enriched in cancer stem cells
(CSCs) (12, 13), allowing development of distant metastases and persistence after
chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Recent reports suggest that cells grown as 3D structures behave differently compared to
monolayer cultures and represent a better approximation of tumors developing in vivo. For
instance, spheroids display distinct genetic expression profiles (14-16), specific intercellular
signaling (17-20), and are subjected to different mechanical forces compared to monolayers
(21-23). The cellular dimensionality and the resulting microenvironment exert a critical
influence on cell survival, impacting drug sensitivity (24, 25) or resistance (26, 27). OC
spheroids can be isolated directly from malignant ascites or cultured from OC cells by using
non-adherent conditions or the hanging drop culture method (28). In this manuscript we set
out to identify oncogenic pathways regulating formation of multicellular aggregates with the
goal of identifying novel targets enriched in 3D culture models. We hypothesized that
inhibition of such targets would disrupt spheroid formation and block cancer metastasis.
Microarray analysis comparing OC multicellular structures to monolayer cultures identified
ALDH1A1, a known CSC marker, upregulated in spheroids. ALDH1A1 was part of a gene

network with β-catenin and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that
ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin target. Both β-catenin knockdown and a novel ALDH1A1
inhibitor (A37) prevented multicellular aggregation, supporting that inhibition of this
pathway effectively disrupts spheroid formation.

Results
Gene expression profiles of OC spheroids

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

OC cell lines (IGROV1, SKOV3, A2780) and primary OC cells derived from malignant
ascites were grown as monolayers, spheroids, or transitioned back from spheroid-tomonolayer cultures. When grown under non-adherent conditions, OC cells formed 3D
aggregates with distinct features. For instance, SKOV3 adenocarcinoma cells, formed
glandular structures with prominent extracellular matrix secretion; IGROV1 endometrioid
cells formed branching spheroids, while A2780 and OVCA primary cells formed compact
round multi-cellular aggregates. Spheroids derived from human primary cells displayed
calcifications, similar to psammoma bodies formed in human tumors (Figure 1A). To
identify genes and pathways upregulated in spheroids, we compared expression profiles of
monolayers, spheroids, or spheroid-to-monolayer IGROV1 cultures using Affymetrix
microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated distinct profiles of 3D
versus 2D cultures, with reversal of the spheroid genotype when cells were transitioned back
to monolayers (Figure 1B) and ANOVA-based statistical analysis identified 473 transcripts
differentially expressed in spheroids compared to monolayers (p<0.01 and FDR<0.01). Of
those, 15 transcripts were upregulated > 4 fold and 25 transcripts were downregulated > 4fold in spheroids versus monolayers (Tables 1 and 2). Validation of top differentially
expressed genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed up-regulation of aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), thrombospondin type I
(THSD), and neurotensin (NTS) and downregulation of family 25, member B (FAM25B), vets erythroblasosis virus homolog (ETS) in spheroids compared to monolayer cultures
(Figure 1C).
ALDHA1 expression in spheroids

Author Manuscript

One of the upregulated transcripts in OC spheroids was ALDH1A1, a recently recognized
stem cell marker (29). Semiquantitative RT-PCR validated increased mRNA expression
levels of ALDH1A1 in SKOV3 and IGROV1 spheroids compared with monolayers (Figure
1D). Interestingly, the other ALDH1 isoforms (A2 and A3) or ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 were
not upregulated in spheroids compared to monolayer cultures (Figure 1D), supporting that
the main isoform upregulated in spheroids is ALDH1A1, as identified by gene expression
analysis. Flow cytometry analysis showed an increased percentage of Aldefluor-positive
cells in spheroids compared with monolayers: 25.05% vs. 6.68% for SKOV3 and 48.0% vs.
20.46% for IGROV1 cells (Figure 1E). The results indicate that culture under ultra-low
adherent conditions selected for a population enriched in Aldefluor-positive cells which are
known to possess self-renewal properties (29, 30).
To investigate potential gene interactions in spheroid formation, the bioinformatics tool
from IPA was used and identified 62 gene networks with statistically significant scores. The

top gene networks represented in spheroids compared to monolayer cultures included:
cancer, cellular growth and proliferation, gastrointestinal disease, cell death and survival,
organismal survival, cellular development, cell cycle, and cellular movement (Figure 2A,
ranking scores ranging from 16 to 36). Within the top networks (cancer and cellular growth
and proliferation) ALDH1A1 was a central node directly connected to β-catenin, c-myc,
nuclear protein transcriptional regulator 1 (NUPR1), T cell factor (TCF), hepatocyte
nuclear factor 4α (HNF4A), and the enhancer binding protein CEBPB (Figure 2B),
suggesting interactions with these molecules under 3D growth conditions. Because of the
previously recognized role of the β-catenin pathway in the maintenance of CSCs (31-33), the
role of ALDH1A1 as a CSC marker (29, 34), and the observed network connections
between ALDH1A1 and several of the β-catenin pathway key elements (β-catenin, c-myc,
TCF, CEBPB), we focused subsequent analyses on validating the β-catenin-ALDH1A1
interaction in the generation of OC spheroids.

B-catenin signaling regulates spheroid formation and self- renewal
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR validated upregulation of β-catenin and of its target genes c-myc
and cyclin D1 in IGROV1 and SKOV3 spheroids compared to monolayers (Figure 2C). An
additional exploratory analysis used quantitative RT-PCR for the human Wnt signaling
pathway and demonstrated an overall upregulation of this pathway in spheroids compared to
monolayers cultures. Specifically, 23 Wnt related transcripts were upregulated > 2-fold in
spheroids vs. monolayers, with 17 genes being known positive regulators of the pathway
(Figure 2D and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Notably, Frizzled receptors 1, 4, and 7 were
upregulated > 4-fold in spheroids cultures, supporting enrichment in Wnt signals leading to
increased β-catenin activity under 3D conditions.

Author Manuscript

To measure β-catenin function in spheroids vs. monolayers, the TCF/LEF reporter assay was
used. A greater than 3-fold increase in TCF/LEF activity was noted in SKOV3 spheroids
compared to monolayers, and a lesser magnitude, but still significant increase was recorded
in IGROV1 cells grown as multi-cellular aggregates (Figure 3A). The results indicate that
the increase in spheroids proliferation was accompanied by an active β-catenin/TCF
transcriptional activity.

Author Manuscript

To further assess the role of β-catenin signaling in spheroid formation, SKOV3 cells were
transiently transfected with siRNA targeting β-catenin or with scrambled siRNA prior to
plating in ultra-low adherent plates to allow sphere formation. B-catenin knockdown
prevented aggregation of cells as spheroids, as quantified by microscopic examination
(Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 1) and semiquantitative and real time RT-PCR
confirmed β-catenin knockdown and corresponding downregulation of its targets c-myc and
cyclin D1 (Figures 3C-D and Supplementary Figure 1). In all, these data support that βcatenin/TCF signaling regulates spheroids proliferation.
Because of the presumed role of spheroids as vehicles of ip dissemination and the observed
effect of β-catenin knockdown disrupting multicellular aggregation, we next measured the
effects of β-catenin knockdown on tumor formation and dissemination in an ip xenograft
model. For this, SKOV3 cells were stably transduced with control or β-catenin targeting
shRNA. Decreased β-catenin expression levels were confirmed in SKOV3 cells transduced

with shRNA targeting β-catenin compared to control shRNA (Figure 3E). Tumor weights
(0.17gms vs. 0.12 gms, p = 0.03) volumes (278.8 mm3 vs. 69.5 mm3, p = 0.01) and number
of peritoneal implants (143 vs. 84, p = 0.002) were significantly decreased in xenografts
derived from SKOV3 cells transduced with shRNA targeting β-catenin compared to those
transduced with control shRNA (Figure 3F). Collectively, these data support the role of βcatenin in OC spheroid formation contributing to peritoneal dissemination.
ALDH1A1 is a β-catenin target gene

Author Manuscript

Further confirmation of β-catenin and ALDH1A1 expression used three sequential spheroids
passages (s1-s3). Phase contrast microscopy demonstrated that OC cells formed more
rapidly compact and large 3D structures after enzymatic dissociation and passage through
several generations (Figure 4A). The spheroids’ self-renewing and growth corresponded to
an increase in β-catenin gene expression. Compared with monolayer cultures, β-catenin
expression levels were up-regulated 2.6- and 4.0-fold respectively in SKOV3 and IGROV1
first generation spheroids. Further increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels was
observed during the second and third spheroid generations in both cell lines (Figures 4A-B),
suggesting its role in the self-renewal and maintenance of spheroids. Furthermore, cyclin D1
expression levels, a β-catenin target (35, 36), were also increased in spheroids vs.
monolayers and in subsequent spheroid passages. In parallel, ALDH1A1 mRNA expression
levels increased during successive spheroid generations from ~1.3- and 1.9-fold for the first
generation to 3.8- and 3.4-fold for third generation spheroids in SKOV3 and IGROV1 cells,
respectively compared with monolayers (Figure 4A).

Author Manuscript

Confirmation of ALDH1A1 and β-catenin expression and cellular localization in monolayers
cultures and in spheroids was obtained by immunofluorescence (IF) based staining and
confocal microscopy. ALDH1A1 was not clearly visualized in monolayer cultures, but was
enriched in OC cells grown as spheroids (Figure 4C). Likewise, β-catenin expression was
increased in cells grown as spheroids compared to monolayers. Furthermore, while in
monolayer cultures, β-catenin was localized at the plasma membrane, translocation to the
nucleus, was observed in cells aggregated as spheroids (Figure 4C), suggesting increased
transcriptional activity. Increased ALDH1A1 expression was recorded in cells where βcatenin was expressed and localized in the nucleus.

Author Manuscript

After establishing the importance of the β-catenin/ALDH1A1 gene interaction during the
formation of spheroids from OC cell lines, we tested whether these genes also regulate the
formation of native spheroids. For this purpose, we isolated spheroids from human OC
ascites and maintained them in non-adherent conditions or as monolayers (n=5 specimens).
To test β-catenin and ALDH1A1 expression during successive spheroid generations, we
used enzymatic and mechanical dissociation prior to passage every 7 days. Figure 5A
illustrates increasing number and more compact spheres formed with each successive
passage. The basal ALDH1A1 and β-catenin mRNA expression levels increased through
successive generations compared with monolayers and were repressed when spheroids were
re-plated as monolayers (Figure 5B), supporting the significance of this pathway to
multicellular aggregation in human primary cells. Flow cytometry analyzed ALDH1A1
enzymatic activity in monolayer cultures and spheroids derived from cells isolated from OC

ascites, noting ~8.7% vs. 2.9% Aldefluor-positive cells in spheroids vs. monolayers,
respectively, consistent with observations in cancer cell lines (Figure 5C).

Author Manuscript

The direct correlation between β-catenin and ALDH1A1 expression levels observed in
spheroids along with the IPA network analysis suggested that ALDH1A1 may represent a βcatenin target. To test this hypothesis, we measured ALDH1A1 mRNA expression levels after
β-catenin knockdown. SiRNA mediated β-catenin downregulation induced decreased
ALDH1A1 expression, suggesting that ALDH1A1 is transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin
(Figure 5D). To definitively demonstrate this concept we searched and identified potential
TCF/LEF responsive elements at positions (-243 to -236), (-147 to-140), (+42 to+48) and
(+118 to +124) within the ALDH1A1 promoter sequence (Figure 5E) by using a promoter
motif searching software (PROMO). ChIP tested whether β-catenin interacts with the
ALDH1A1 promoter. PCR amplified the ALDH1A1 promoter fragments corresponding to
the TCF/LEF responsive regions in the chromatin pulled down by a β-catenin antibody
(Figure 5E, lanes 4-5). Specificity of β-catenin antibody binding to ALDH1A1 promoter was
demonstrated by observing no PCR product in chromatin immunoprecipitated with IgG
(Figure 5E, lanes 8-10). These data demonstrate that ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin target
in OC cells.
Targeting ALDH1A1 disrupts OC spheroid formation

Author Manuscript

Having shown that OC multicellular aggregates are enriched in ALDH1A1+ cells and that
ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin target, we next explored whether ALDH1A1 enzymatic
inhibitors disrupt spheroid formation and OC cell survival under non-adherent culture
conditions. We used a novel ALDH1A1 inhibitor (A37) identified through high throughput
screening of the ChemDiv library and the less selective inhibitor DEAB. A37 has a
molecular weight of 431.6 Daltons and no structural similarity to any known aldehyde
dehydrogenase inhibitors (Figure 6A). A37 has good potency (IC50 of 4.6 ± 0.8 μM; Ki of
300 ± 26 nM) and is selective for ALDH1A1 with no effect on the other members of the
ALDH1A subfamily (ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3), or toward ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 at
concentrations up to 100 μM (Figure 6B). A37 has a competitive mode of inhibition with
respect to varied substrate acetaldehyde (Figure 6C).

Author Manuscript

To test the activity of A37 in OC cells, IGROV1 cells grown under low attachment
conditions were used. Under these conditions, the ALDH1A1+ population represents
~30-50% of the cell population. Treatment with A37 blocked ALDH1A1 activity as
measured by flow cytometry in IGROV1 cells in a dose dependent manner and more
significantly than DEAB (Figure 6D). A dose response experiment demonstrated dosedependent inhibition of spheroid formation starting at 1μM concentration (Figure 6E-F) and
dose-dependent decrease in cell viability at concentrations greater than 1μM (Figure 6G).
A37 also induced moderate sensitization of IGROV1 cells to cisplatin, a common cytotoxic
used for the treatment of OC (Figure 6H-I). Collectively these data support that targeting of
ALDH1A1 with a novel small molecule blocks OC cell proliferation and survival under 3D
culture conditions and synergizes with chemotherapy.

Discussion
Through genomic profiling we identified ALDH1A1 and β-catenin signaling, two known
pathways regulating CSCs, as being upregulated and interconnected in OC spheroids
compared to monolayer cultures. We demonstrated that ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin
target and that its inhibition by a novel small molecule disrupts formation of multicellular
aggregates. Our data point to novel pathways activated in anoikis-resistant spheroids and
potential new strategies to target them. These results have several implications.

Author Manuscript

First, we identified a specific gene network activated under 3D conditions compared to
monolayer cultures. Other studies have explored the molecular characteristics of 3D
cultures, demonstrating differences in gene expression based on culture conditions (37-39).
It is increasingly accepted that multicellular aggregates are a better representation of human
tumors compared to standard cultures on plastic. Cell growth under 3D conditions replicates
the mechanical forces and gradients of oxygen and nutrient existent in native tissues which
regulate cellular polarity, differentiation, and activate various morphogenic signaling
programs. Well established breast cancer 3D models have replicated the architecture of
normal or transformed mammary tissue and helped understanding cellular differentiation
and response to therapy (40-42). OC cells grown as spheroids display distinct response to
chemotherapeutics compared to monolayers (43, 44) and adopt an invasive phenotype
characterized by a TGF-βfibrotic response that may protect them from unfavorable external
conditions (9, 45). These features suggest that cells grown as spheroids may be enriched in
stem cells. The genomic signature identified in this study identifies several CSCs markers
upregulated in spheroids, including c-KIT, β-catenin, and ALDH1A1.

Author Manuscript

Second, our data point to β-catenin as an important pathway activated in spheroids. Bcatenin activation has been implicated in the self-renewal and survival of hematopoietic,
cutaneous and gastrointestinal stem cells (33, 46-48), however its role in ovarian CSCs has
not yet been defined. The wingless pathway, which is an upstream regulator of β-catenin, is
required for the maintenance of somatic stem cells in the Drosophila ovary (49) and
activation of β-catenin has found downstream of the stem cell factor receptor in c-kit
positive ovarian tumor initiating cells (50). The data presented here identify β-catenin
involvement in the formation of OC multicellular aggregates and demonstrate that its
targeting disrupts sphere formation, cell proliferation under non-adherent conditions, tumor
metastasis in vivo, and expression of the stem cell marker ALDH1A1. These results suggest
that inhibition of this pathway, or of its key downstream elements, may be instrumental in
eliminating OC spheroids containing the stem cell population.

Author Manuscript

Third, we identified ALDH1A1 upregulation in spheroids through a non-biased genome
mining approach. ALDH1A1 is a member of the highly conserved ALDH family which
includes 18 other enzymes involved in the metabolism of reactive aldehydes (51). Through
their detoxification functions, ALDHs exert cytoprotective roles in various tissues. In
addition, the enzymes catalyze retinol oxidation to retinal, a limiting step during the
synthesis of retinoic acid, which regulates cellular differentiation. Recent reports have linked
ALDHs, and particularly ALDH1A1, to stem cells, both in normal (52), and in malignant
tissues (53). It remains unknown whether the enzyme represents only a CSC marker or

whether it is implicated in regulating the functions of stem cells. While several other
markers have been proposed to recognize OC stem cells (13), ALDH1A1 activity detectable
through the aldefluor assay has been validated as a reproducible CSC phenotype (29, 30).
ALDH1A1+ cells have tumor initiating capacity, are resistant to cisplatin, and express
higher levels of stem cell transcription factors (Sox2, nanog)(30, 34). Here we show that
ALDH1A1 expression is increased in spheroids vs. monolayers and in successive spheroid
generations, consistent with the recognized capacity of stem cells to organize as spheres and
to self-renew. Furthermore we demonstrate that ALDH1A1 is a direct target of β-catenin, a
pathway required in CSCs’ self-renewal (46, 47). This is the first demonstration that
ALDH1A1 expression is regulated by the TCF/LEF transcriptional complex and our
observations strengthen the connection between the enzyme and an ovarian CSC phenotype.

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, we describe for the first time the activity of a new small molecule targeting
ALDH1A1 in OC spheroids. A37 is a relatively potent first-generation selective inhibitor for
ALDH1A1 with a Ki of 300 nM, without significant effect on related orthologs in the
ALDH family of enzymes. The effects of this small molecule inhibitor were tested on cells
growing as spheres, as the 3D culture system allows for enrichment in ALDH1A1+
population. This is the first proof of principle that selective inhibition of ALDH1A1 blocks
survival of OC cells by targeting the ALDH1A1+ population and supports a functional role
for ALDH1A1 in this population. The results support further study of ALDH1A1 inhibitors
alone or in combination with cytotoxics in OC models aiming to eradicate chemotherapyresistant and perpetually self-renewing cancer stem cells.

normalized by subtracting the Ct of target genes from that of the housekeeping control
(GAPDH). Results are presented as means +/− SD of replicates. Each measurement was
performed in duplicate and experiments were run three times in independent conditions.
Wnt Pathway PCR-Array

Author Manuscript

The human Wnt Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array and RT2 Real-Timer SyBR
Green/ROX PCR Mix were purchased from SA Bioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD,
USA). PCR was performed on ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems).
For data analysis the ΔΔCt method was used; for each gene, fold-changes being calculated
as difference in gene expression between spheroid and monolayer cultures.
Aldefluor Assay and Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

ALDH1 enzymatic activity was measured using the Aldefluor assay (Stemcell
Technologies). Briefly, dissociated monolayer and spheroid single cells were resuspended in
Aldefluor assay buffer containing the ALDH1 substrate, bodipyaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA)
at 1.5 mM, and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. The test ALDH1A1-positive population was
gated using control cells incubated under identical condition in the presence of a 10-fold
molar excess of the ALDH inhibitor, diethylamino benzaldehyde (DEAB). The relative
increase in FITC signal of the ALDH-positive cells was determined by a FACS Aria II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed three times in independent
experiments.
Gene reporter assays
Dual-Luciferase Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was performed to quantify Wnt/βcatenin signaling through TCF/LEF1 promoter activity in SKOV3 and IGROV1cells grown
as monolayers and spheroids. Cells were transiently co-transfected with TCF/LEF1
promoter luciferase and Renilla plasmids, at a ratio of 10:1 using DreamFect Gold
transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). Luminescence was measured by using TD-20/20
Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Madison, WI, USA) 24 hours after transfection.
Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice in independent conditions. To
control for transfection efficiency, luminescence was normalized to Renilla activity.

Immunofluorescence (IF)
SKOV3 cells grown as monolayers on fibronectin-coated chamber slides (BD Biosciences)
were stained as previously described (54), using β-catenin and ALDH1A1 antibodies. OC
spheroids were fixed, permeabilized, and stained following a previously described protocol
(55). Secondary antibodies included Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500; Zymed)
and Alexa fluor-488 anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA).

Isotype-specific IgG was a negative control. Nuclei were visualized by 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories) in monolayers and by
Hoechst staining (Molecular Probes) in spheroids. Confocal images were acquired with a
confocal/two-photon Olympus Fluoview FV-1000 MPE system (Olympus America, Central
Valley, PA, USA) available at the Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy (ICBM) facility
(Indianapolis, IN, USA), using an Olympus XLUMPLFL 20×, NA 0.95 water immersion
objective. Images were collected in a sequential illumination mode using 405-, 488- and
633-nm laser lines while fluorescent emission was collected with three PMTs using
425-475nm, 500-600nm and 655-755nm emission filters. Series of optical sections through
the depth of spheroids (Z-stacks) were collected using optimal step size settings (1.18 um/
slice) with images comprised of 800×800 pixels (488.2 × 488.2μm2). 3D reconstitution used
Voxx software at ICBM (Indianapolis, IN, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Author Manuscript

To detect the interaction between the transcriptional complex β-catenin/TCF/LEF1 and the
ALDH1A1 promoter, we used ChIP using a kit from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA USA,
see SM). The DNA was extracted from β-catenin or IgG immunoprecipitates by using the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and was subjected to PCR
amplification using primers designed for the TCF/LEF1 binding domain of the ALDH1A1
promoter (Table S3 SM). The PCR products were resolved by 2 % agarose-ethidium
bromide gel electrophoresis, visualized by UV, and quantified by densitometric analysis
using Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.1. As a positive control, DNA immunoprecipitated with β-catenin
antibody was amplified using primers for c-Myc promoter, a known TCF/LEF1 target gene.
As negative control, DNA immunoprecipitated with β-catenin antibody was amplified with
primers designed for the ALDH1A1 promoter, upstream of the predicted TCF/LEF1 binding
sites.
I.p. ovarian xenograft model
1×106 SKOV3 cells stably transduced with shRNA control or targeting β-catenin, were
injected i.p. in 7–8 weeks old female nude mice (n= 5 and 7, respectively) from Harlan
(Indianapolis, IN, USA). Four weeks after injection, mice were euthanized, tumors were
harvested, measured bi-dimensionally if >5mm and peritoneal implants were counted.
Tumor volume was calculated as L*W2/2; where L is length and W is width. Experiments
were approved by the IU Animal Care and Use Committee, being in compliance with federal
regulations.
Discovery and characterization of ALDH inhibitors

Author Manuscript

ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, and ALDH3A1 were produced and purified
as previously described (56). A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 64,000 compounds from
the ChemDiv Corp. was performed to identify activators and inhibitors of ALDH1A1. The
hydrolysis of para-nitrophenylacetate [27] was used as a measure ALDH1A1 activity (see
SM). Selectivity for closely related orthologs was tested at 20 and 100 μM using purified
recombinant human ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, and ALDH3A1.
Dehydrogenase activity of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH2 were measured

in a solution containing 100–200 nM enzyme, 200 μM NAD+, 1% DMSO, and 100 μM
propionaldehyde in 50 mM sodium BES, pH 7.5. ALDH3A1 activity was measured using
25 nM enzyme, 200 μM NAD+, 1% DMSO, and 1 mM benzaldehyde in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. All assays were performed at 25°C and were initiated by the
addition of the aldehyde substrate following a 2 minute pre-incubation with compound and
NAD+. IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data to the four parameter EC50 equation
using SigmaPlot (StatSys v.12.3, San Jose, CA, USA). The values represent the average of
three independent experiments (each n = 3) using at least two protein preparations. The
mode of inhibition was determined via steady-state kinetics by co-varying inhibitor and
substrate concentrations at fixed concentration of the second substrate. All data were fit to
tight-binding competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed inhibition models
using SigmaPlot (StatSys v.12.3, San Jose, CA, USA).

Cell proliferation and viability
Cell viability was measured by the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies,
Rockville, MD, USA). Cell proliferation was quantified by the MTT assay. Spheroids were
counted after centrifugation at 300xg for 5 minutes. All assays were performed in four
replicates. Data are presented as means ± SEM.
Gene expression profiling

Author Manuscript

RNA extracted from IGROV1 cells grown as monolayer, spheroids, or spheroids transferred
to monolayer, was labeled using the standard Affymetrix protocol for the Whole Transcript
Target Labeling and Control Reagents kit (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to
the Affymetrix user manual: GeneChip® Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay
GeneChip. Three biological replicates were used. Individual labeled samples were
hybridized to the Human Gene 1.0 ST GeneChips® for 17 hours then washed, stained and
scanned with the standard protocol using Affymetrix GCOS (GeneChip Operating System,
Affimetrix). GCOS was used to generate CEL data files, which were imported into Partek
Genomics Suite (PGS, Partek, Inc., St. Louis, Mo).
Data Processing and Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) background correction with quantile normalization of
data was performed to remove background noise (see SM). Genes that had a p<0.001,
FDR<0.05, and fold difference exceeding +/−0.5 fold were considered dysregulated. Data
are deposited in GEO under acquisition number GSE16931151. Hierarchical clustering was
performed using PGS with Pearson's dissimilarity as row and column dissimilarity measures
and average linkage as linkage method. Lists of differentially expressed genes between
phenotypic groups were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (© Ingenuity Systems,
Redwood City, CA, USA) software to identify differentially dysregulated gene pathways
and networks.

A, SKOV3 and IGROV1 cells grown as monolayers were co-transfected with TCF/LEF1
luciferase reporter and Renilla control plasmid, prior to plating as monolayers or spheroids.
Luciferase activity relative to renilla activity compared monolayers and spheroids at 24 and
48 hours and is expressed as fold increase. Data are shown as means of duplicate
measurements +/− SD. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Significant
differences are marked. B, SKOV3 cells were transfected with scrambled or β-catenin
targeting siRNA prior to plating in ultra-low attachment plates. Sphere counts are shown as
means +/− SD of quadruplicate measurements. C, Semiquantitative RT-PCR measures βcatenin and c-Myc expression levels in SKOV3 spheroid cells transfected with scrambled or
β-catenin targeting siRNA. Densitometry shows relative gene expression normalized for
GAPDH. D, Real-time PCR measures the expression levels of β-catenin target genes c-Myc
and cyclin D1 in SKOV3 cells transfected with scrambled or β-catenin targeting siRNA.
Data are shown as means +/− SD of 3 replicate measurements. E, Western blotting shows βcatenin expression levels in SKOV3 cells stably transduced with control- and β-catenin
targeting shRNA and used for ip inoculation of nude mice. F, Tumor weights, volumes, and
numbers of peritoneal metastases derived from SKOV3 cells stably transduced with controland β-catenin targeting shRNA and injected ip in nude mice (n = 5 and 7, respectively). Data
are shown as means +/− SEM. Significant differences are marked.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR for β-catenin and ALDH1A1 mRNA expression levels comparing
monolayers, three generation of spheroids, and spheroid to monolayer cultures.
Densitometry quantified β-catenin and ALDH1A1 normalized with the house-keeping gene
18S. C, Flow cytometry quantifies Aldefluor positive cells derived from OC ascites and
grown as spheroids compared with monolayers. DEAB-treated cells serve as negative
controls. Measurements were performed in duplicates. D, Semiquantitative RT-PCR for
ALDH1A1 expression levels in SKOV3 cells transfected with scrambled or β-catenin
targeting siRNA. E, Scheme representing the TCF/LEF1 binding sequences within the
ALDH1A1 promoter relative to the designed primers (top panel). ChIP assay used
chromatin from IGROV1 cells immunoprecipitated with β-catenin or IgG (control). Results
of PCR amplification are as follows: DNA ladder; chromatin from IGROV1 cells not
subjected to IP (input) and amplified with 2 sets of primers corresponding to the two
predicted TCF/LEF1 binding sequences on the ALDH1A1 promoter (lanes 1-2,f1/r1 and
f2/r2) or with primers corresponding to the TCF/LEF binding site on the c-myc promoter
(lane 3, positive control); chromatin immunoprecipitated with β-catenin antibody and
amplified with ALDH1A1 promoter specific primers (lanes 4-5, f1/r1 and f2/r2); ALDH1A1
promoter nonspecific primers (lane 6, up f/r, negative control), or c-myc promoter specific
primers (lane 7, positive control); or chromatin immunoprecipitated with IgG and amplified
with ALDH1A1 and c-myc specific primers (lanes 8-10, negative controls).
