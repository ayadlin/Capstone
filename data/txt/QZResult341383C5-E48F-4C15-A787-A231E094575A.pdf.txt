BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of baseline renal function on treatment outcome in
patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC). METHODS: Retrospective data from 6 North American cancer centers (3 US and 3 Canadian) were pooled to
identify patients with mRCC treated with VEGF-targeted therapy. Patient characteristics, response rate, time to treatment
failure, and overall survival were collected. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula was used at therapy initiation
for calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-nine patients with mRCC who received
sunitinib (n ¼ 323), sorafenib (n ¼ 165), or bevacizumab (n ¼ 41) were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics
included: 74% male, median age 61 years, and median GFR 60.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range, 6.5-174.2). On univariate analysis,
patients with a GFR <60 (n ¼ 262) were more likely to have had a previous nephrectomy (P < .0001) and to be older (P <
.0001), but were less likely to have poor prognostic features such as anemia (P ¼ .041), hypercalcemia (P ¼ .008), neutrophilia (P ¼ .039), thrombocytosis (P < .0001), short diagnosis to treatment interval (P ¼ .007), and low Karnofsky performance status (P ¼ .051). GFR <60, when adjusted for poor risk factors, did not have an impact on type of objective response
(odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-2.32; P ¼ .359), time to treatment failure (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% CI,
0.79-1.19; P ¼ .772), or overall survival (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69-1.17; P ¼ .439). CONCLUSIONS: Renal function at therapy initiation does not adversely affect the efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapy in mRCC. Clinicians should not avoid treating

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is an incurable malignancy that results in approximately 13,000 deaths
annually in the United States.1 An increased understanding of the biology of mRCC has resulted in an explosion of new
targeted agents that have shown efficacy and have been approved for the treatment of this disease. Chief among these targeted agents are those directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): sunitinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab.
These agents are approved for the first-line treatment of mRCC in North America and Europe and have replaced immunotherapy as first-line standard of care. As clinicians are incorporating these agents into standard treatment for mRCC,
questions surrounding their safety and efficacy in renal dysfunction have arisen.
There are limited data available regarding the incidence of renal dysfunction in mRCC; however, this is a patient
population at risk for impaired renal function. At least 1 small series has estimated the incidence of chronic kidney disease
in mRCC to be 37%.2 In light of the finding that patients with mRCC may have several risk factors for impaired renal
function (eg, previous nephrectomy, history of chronic kidney disease), it is essential for clinicians to understand if the

efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapies in the context of renal
dysfunction is compromised. Unfortunately, there is a
paucity of published literature pertaining to this. Recent
case reports have suggested that sunitinib may be given to
patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with
no significant increase in treatment related toxicity,3,4 and a
phase 1 trial has shown that the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib is not altered in patients with renal impairment.5
A small (N ¼ 39) retrospective case series has further suggested that sunitinib and sorafenib may be safely administered in patients with RCC who have impaired renal
function,6 but little is known about the use of bevacizumab
in this patient population. Despite these recent publications
and to our knowledge, there has never been a large, population-based study looking at not only the incidence of renal
dysfunction in patients with mRCC, but also at the use and
efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapies in this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Five hundred twenty-nine patients with mRCC treated
with sunitinib, sorafenib, or bevacizumab between August
2004 and July 2008 were included in this study. Patient
data were collected from consecutive patient series from 6
North American Cancer Centers: Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (Boston, Mass), Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute (Cleveland, Ohio), Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (Boston, Mass), British Columbia Cancer
Agency (Vancouver, Victoria, Kelowna, and Surrey, British Columbia, Canada), Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta, Canada), and the Princess Margaret
Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Patients with a diagnosis of mRCC of any histologic
subtype who received treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib,
or bevacizumab were included in this study. Patients who
received their VEGF-targeted therapy as second-line treatment (ie, those who had previously received treatment
with immunotherapy) were included in the study.
Patients were excluded if they had received temsirolimus
(an mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor), an investigational agent (ie, PTK787, AZD2171), or an investigational combination (ie, bevacizumab plus erlotinib,
bevacizumab plus sunitinib).
Data Collection
Data were obtained retrospectively on all patients using
uniform database templates to ensure consistent data collection across all study centers. Baseline demographic,

clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Factors known
to have prognostic value were also collected.7-10 All laboratory values were standardized against institutional upper
limit of normal and lower limit of normal values when
appropriate. Baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was
calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) formula at the time of therapy initiation,11 as this
equation provides a more accurate estimate of GFR than creatinine clearance measured by commonly used equations,
such as the Cockcroft-Gault formula. An a priori decision
was made to assess patients in 2 groups based upon the
National Kidney Foundation definition of moderate/stage 3
renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2).12 Patients
with an MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were compared
with patients with an MDRD 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subsequently, subgroup analysis was performed on patients with
MDRD between 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and MDRD
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in comparison to those patients with
MDRD 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Outcome data on response
rates and overall survival were obtained from patient charts.
This study received institutional review board approval from
each participating center.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated on the entire population. The study patients were dichotomized using an a priori cutoff of MDRD of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Chi-square
tests were used to compare baseline disease characteristics
between the 2 GFR groups. Overall survival (OS) is
defined as the time from initiation of VEGF-targeted
therapy to death as a result of any cause or censored at the
date of last follow-up. Time to treatment failure (TTF) is
defined as time from initiation of VEGF-targeted therapy
until progression, therapy cessation for toxicity, death, or
censored at last follow-up. OS and TTF distributions
were estimated using Kaplan-Meier product limit methodology. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard
models were conducted to estimate odds ratios for treatment response and hazards ratios for OS and TTF while
adjusting for known poor prognostic risk factors (anemia,
hypercalcemia, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, Karnofsky
performance status <80%, and diagnosis to treatment
interval of <1 year). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Of the 573 patients with mRCC who were initially evaluated, 529 had data on baseline renal function (GFR) and
were included in this analysis. Median age was 61 years,

74% of the patient population was male, and median
GFR (MDRD score) was 60.1 mL/min/1.73 m2. Baseline

limit of normal, corrected calcium greater than the upper
limit of normal (ULN), Karnofsky performance status
<80%, time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year, serum
lactate dehydrogenase >1.5 ULN, neutrophils greater

1.73 m2 and for those with MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73
m2. Among those patients with MDRD <60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (n ¼ 262, 49.5%), 243 had an MDRD between
30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2, 14 had an MDRD between
15 and 29 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5 had an MDRD <15
mL/min/1.73 m2. Three hundred twenty-three patients
received sunitinib, 165 received sorafenib, and 41 received
bevacizumab. On univariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences between groups with regard to
the following baseline characteristics: the group with
MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was older and more likely

MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had more favorable baseline characteristics.
Median follow-up after treatment initiation was
28.1 months (range, 0-56 months). At the time of data
analysis, 427 patients (81%) have stopped targeted therapy,
and 258 patients (49%) remain alive. When adjusted for
the adverse risk factors that were recently identified for
patients treated with VEGF-targeted agents,7 MDRD <60
mL/min/1.73 m2 did not have an impact on the type of
objective response observed. Odds ratio for clinical benefit

9.7 months for the MDRD <60 group. The hazard ratio
(HR) for stopping treatment when adjusted for adverse
prognostic factors was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.79-1.19; P ¼ .772).

population. The median OS after initiation of VEGF-targeted therapy was 19.2 months in the group with MDRD
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with 27.5 months in the
group with MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. As demonstrated in Table 2, multivariate Cox regression analysis
revealed that MDRD score was not significantly associated
with OS when adjusted for those known adverse prognostic
factors (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69-1.17; P ¼ .439).
In our cohort, among patients with MDRD <60
mL/min/1.73 m2, the majority (n ¼ 243) had MDRD
between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and a small group
of patients had MDRD <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n ¼ 19).
When the analysis was further broken down by the 2 subgroups, median TTF and OS were 10.0 and 27.5 months,
respectively, in the group with MDRD between 30 and 59
mL/min/1.73 m2, and median TTF and OS were 5.0 and
20.0 months, respectively, in the group with the lowest
MDRD score. In multivariate analysis adjusted for adverse
prognostic factors, we did not observe any significant difference when comparing each of the 2 groups (MDRD 30-59

368

and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) to patients with more favorable GFR (MDRD 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (P ¼ .56 and
.30 for OS, P ¼ .79 and .87 for TTF, and P ¼ .84 and .81
for clinical response rate, respectively).
Considering that 33% of patients received their
VEGF-targeted therapy as second-line treatment, we also
examined whether the relation of GFR with treatment
outcomes differed between the groups with and without
prior immunotherapy. Results showed that MDRD score
was not significantly associated with OS, TTF, and clinical response on targeted therapy regardless of prior treatment status, and no interaction effect was detected
between line of therapy and the MDRD score on treatment outcomes when adjusted for those prognostic factors
(P-interaction >.25, Table 3). Similarly, there was no
association between GFR and treatment outcomes when
the analysis was stratified by type of targeted therapy
(sunitinib vs nonsunitinib). Results did not differ by type
of targeted therapy in multivariate analysis (P-interaction
>.30, Table 3).

Renal Function in mRCC/Macfarlane et al

DISCUSSION
This is the largest population-based analysis of the impact
of renal function on delivery of treatment, objective
response, and survival outcomes in the era of VEGFtargeted therapy for mRCC. In our patient population
that was derived from 6 Cancer Centers across North
America, 50% had MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, indicating at least grade III or moderate renal dysfunction.
There are several potential etiologies for the renal
dysfunction observed in mRCC. Many patients with
mRCC have had either partial or radical nephrectomy as
part of their up-front management if they initially presented with localized disease. Furthermore, cytoreductive
nephrectomy has been shown to confer a survival benefit
compared with immunotherapy alone in patients with
mRCC,13-16 and a recent population-based analysis demonstrated a rate of cytoreductive nephrectomy in mRCC
of 30% in the United States.17
Given the high prevalence of renal dysfunction
among patients with mRCC, it is essential that we understand whether it is possible to effectively administer targeted therapies in the context of decreased GFR. Despite
recent evidence that the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib
and sorafenib in renal dysfunction are not substantially
altered,5,18 most clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies in mRCC mandate normal or
near normal renal function. Furthermore, although a
recently published small retrospective series has demonstrated that sunitinib and sorafenib are safely tolerated in
the context of renal insufficiency,6 until now there has not
been a large population-based cohort to assess the realistic
impact of renal dysfunction on the delivery of targeted
therapies in clinical practice.
Although a nuclear renogram is the gold standard
for assessment of renal function, we used the MDRD formula. This formula has been validated in previous studies19 and is the standard method of measurement of
glomerular filtration rate in large clinical trials. Our analysis has shown that moderate renal dysfunction does not
impact the ability to deliver sunitinib, sorafenib, or bevacizumab. Patients with MDRD <60 mL/min/1.73 m2
remained on treatment a median of 3 months longer than
patients with normal MDRD. The longer duration of targeted treatment in the MDRD <60 cohort is likely
because the groups were unbalanced for several validated
prognostic factors at baseline. It is uncertain why the
groups were imbalanced, but perhaps physicians were
more likely to treat favorable risk patients rather than
poor risk patients with renal dysfunction on the assumpCancer

tion that poor risk patients would not tolerate treatment.
This potential selection bias was partially accounted for
by adjusting outcomes by known prognostic criteria.7
Small reports that suggest efficacy of VEGF-targeted
therapies in patients with mRCC who have renal dysfunction have been published, but our analysis addresses this
question on a much larger scale than previously reported.
The strengths of this study include the size of our study
population, which has allowed us to adjust for potentially
confounding covariates and to robustly demonstrate that
patients with mRCC and renal dysfunction treated with
VEGF-targeted drugs have outcomes similar to those
patients with normal renal function.
A limitation of this study is that we do not report
toxicity data, as this information is difficult to reliably
capture retrospectively. Case reports suggest that there is
no increased toxicity in the context of renal impairment,20
but prospectively collected toxicity data are required for
all VEGF-targeted therapies. Second, we only had information pertaining to renal function at baseline before initiation of targeted therapy. As renal function is not static,
serial assessment of renal function while on therapy would
have been more illustrative. However, clinicians are not
privy to this information when deciding whether to start a
drug. A final concern is that we had only a small cohort of
patients with severe renal dysfunction (MDRD <30 mL/
min/1.73 m2), and although this did not appear to impact
outcome, further evaluation of this question with larger
patient numbers is necessary.
Despite the finding that 50% of patients with
mRCC have at least moderate renal dysfunction,
decreased GFR was not associated with inability to receive
VEGF-targeted therapy and did not have an impact on
objective response or OS. Clinicians treating patients with
mRCC who have renal impairment should not avoid
VEGF-targeted treatment.
