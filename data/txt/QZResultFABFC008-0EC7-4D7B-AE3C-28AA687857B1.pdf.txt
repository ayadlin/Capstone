Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in women with advanced estrogen receptor-positive/HER2negative breast cancer acquire a HER2-positive subpopulation following multiple courses of
therapy1,2. In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to
HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the
evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here, we analyzed CTCs from 19 ER+/HER2−

patients, 84% of whom had acquired CTCs expressing HER2. Cultured CTCs maintain discrete
HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations: HER2+ CTCs are more proliferative but not addicted to
HER2, consistent with activation of multiple signaling pathways. HER2− CTCs show activation of
Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but sensitivity
to Notch inhibition. HER2+ and HER2− CTCs interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one
phenotype producing daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. While HER2+ and
HER2− CTCs have comparable tumor initiating potential, differential proliferation favors the
HER2+ state, while oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2−
phenotype. Simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained
suppression of tumorigenesis in orthotopic CTC-derived tumor models. Together, these results
point to distinct yet interconverting phenotypes within patient-derived CTCs, contributing to
progression of breast cancer and acquisition of drug resistance.

We documented the emergence of HER2+ CTCs in patients initially diagnosed with estrogen
receptor-positive/HER2-negative (ER+/HER2−) breast cancer, after multiple courses of
therapy for recurrent metastatic breast cancer. Using microfluidic CTC-iChip purification
followed by imaging flow cytometry3, 16/19 (84%) patients had HER2+ CTCs (Fig. 1a,
Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplemental Table 1). 22 individual CTCs from two
representative patients (Brx-42, Brx-82) were isolated and subjected to single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq). HER2 expression was bimodal in distribution (≤ 1 read per
million (RPM) vs median 133, range 32–217 RPM; p = 7.5e-6) (Fig. 1b), indicating the
existence of discrete HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations. In these patients, the fraction of
HER2+ CTCs increased with disease progression (Extended Data Fig. 1b). HER2+ CTCs
were not restricted to ER+/HER2− breast cancer: 2/13 patients with ER−/PR−/HER2−
breast cancer also had HER2+ and HER2− CTC subpopulations (Extended Data Fig. 1c). In
ER+/HER2− breast cancers, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of patient-matched
metastatic tumor biopsies showed increased HER2+ staining, compared with primary tumors
(Fig. 1c). Unlike HER2-amplified breast cancer, HER2+ tumor cells within metastatic
lesions did not have evidence of gene amplification (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

The CTC-iChip efficiently captures viable CTCs3, enabling derivation of CTC cultures4. We
established CTC lines (Brx-42, Brx-82, Brx-142) with discrete HER2+/HER2−
subpopulations comparable to patient-matched primary CTCs (Fig. 1a, d and Extended Data
Fig. 1e, f). HER2 overexpression was not due to gene amplification, and no distinguishing
mutations were identified between HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations (Extended Data Fig.
1g and Supplemental Table 2). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of HER2+ vs
HER2− subpopulations showed distinct functional properties: HER2+ CTCs had a higher
proliferation rate (Fig. 1e), with increased staining for the proliferation marker Ki67, but no
change in apoptotic markers cleaved-caspase 3 or annexin 5 (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).
We tested the relative tumorigenicity of HER2+ vs HER2− CTCs following injection into
the mouse mammary fat pad. Both FACS-purified HER2+ and HER2− CTCs generated
tumors, with HER2+ tumors being larger and having a higher frequency of lung metastases
(Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). Despite differences in proliferation, limiting dilution

studies showed that HER2+ and HER2− CTCs initiate tumors from as few as 200 cells,
pointing to comparable progenitor potential (Extended Data Fig. 2e).
The coexistence of HER2+ and HER2− CTCs, despite differing proliferation rates, led us to
test whether these subpopulations are capable of interconversion. After 4 weeks in culture,
FACS-purified GFP-tagged HER2− CTCs acquired HER2+ cells (Brx-82: 42%; Brx-142:
46%), while HER2+ CTCs generated HER2− cells at lower efficiency (Brx-82: 5%;
Brx-142: 11%) (Fig. 2a, b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). By 8 weeks, the parental HER2+/
HER2− composition was nearly reestablished (Fig. 2b). This interconversion was also
evident by mixing equal proportions of GFP+/HER2+ and GFP−/HER2− CTCs, with the
emergence of GFP+/HER2− and GFP−/HER2+ cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

Author Manuscript

To better define the timing of HER2+/HER2− interconversion, we established, single cellderived CTC colonies using HER2-based FACS, followed by sequential confocal
microscopy. Colonies were scored for HER2 and EpCAM expression at 1, 3, 5–9, 10–19 and
>20 cell stages. Single HER2− CTCs initially proliferated slowly (Extended Data Fig. 3b),
and first acquired HER2+ daughter cells at the 5–9 cell stage (6.5%), with rapid
interconversion thereafter (10–19 cells: 47%, >20 cells: 59%; Fig. 2c, d). The more rapidly
proliferating single HER2+ CTCs also generated HER2− progeny at the 5–9 cell stage (5%),
but the proportion of HER2− CTCs rose more slowly (10–19 cells: 17%, >20 cells: 22%;
Fig. 2c, d). Thus, interconversion between HER2+/HER2− phenotypes occurs spontaneously
as early as four cell doublings.

Author Manuscript

Interconversion between HER2+ and HER2− phenotypes was also tested in vivo by
orthotopic inoculation of FACS-purified CTCs. Tumors established from HER2− CTCs
displayed HER2+ subpopulations, and vice versa (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3c). In
vivo interconversion was confirmed by injecting a 1:1 mixture of GFP+/HER2+ and GFP−/
HER2− CTCs (or the converse), followed by dual GFP and HER2 IHC. Within mixed
tumors, GFP-tagged HER2− CTCs produced GFP+/HER2+ cells (44%), and in separate
tumors, GFP-tagged HER2+ CTCs generated HER2− cells (21%) (Fig. 2f and Extended
Data Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

To define the molecular characteristics of HER2+ vs HER2− CTCs, we quantitatively
mapped the global proteomes (>6300 proteins) of FACS-purified subpopulations (Brx-42,
Brx-82, Brx-142) using multiplexed mass spectrometry (MS) with isobaric tandem mass
tags (TMT)5 (Supplemental Table 3). While proteome profiles of individual cell lines were
distinct, they shared, differences between HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations (Pearson
correlation coefficients: Brx-82 vs. Brx-142=0.81; Brx-82 vs. Brx-42=0.71; Brx-42 vs.
Brx-142=0.64) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). HER2+ CTCs showed enrichment
(Pathway Interaction Database; PID) of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and pro-growth
signaling (GSEA, FDR ≤ 0.25) (Fig. 3b and Supplemental Tables 3, 4). Phosphotyrosine
blots from the HER2+ subpopulations confirmed RTK phosphorylation (HER2, HER3,
HER4, Insulin Receptor (INSR), AXL/DTK, EPHA1 and EPHA2), which was absent from
matched HER2− CTCs (Extended Data Fig. 4c). scRNA-seq analysis of 15 primary HER2+
CTCs compared with 7 HER2− CTCs from matched patient blood samples showed
enrichment for 15 of 32 shared pathways (ERBB1, ERBB2/ERBB3, IGF1, EPHA2, MET)

identified by MS analysis of CTC lines (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4d, e and Supplemental
Tables 4, 5). In contrast to HER2+ CTCs, MS analysis of cultured HER2− CTCs showed
increased expression of proteins enriched in Notch (HES/HEY, Presenilin 1 (PS1)) and DNA
damage pathways (AuroraB, ATM, ATR, Fanconi) (GSEA, FDR ≤ 0.25) (Fig. 3c and
Supplemental Tables 3, 4).

Author Manuscript

To explore the potential therapeutic significance of pathways differentially activated in
HER2+ vs HER2− CTC subpopulations, we screened a panel of 55 drugs selected both for
clinical relevance and ability to target MS-identified pathways (Supplemental Table 6).
HER2+ CTCs were no more sensitive to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib than HER2− CTCs
(IC50 = 1μM), indicating they are not “oncogene addicted” to HER2, unlike the HER2amplified SKBR3 cells (IC50=5 nM) (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). However, dual
inhibition of HER2 and IGF1R, another RTK activated in HER2+ CTCs, was cytotoxic to
HER2+ but not HER2− CTCs (Fig. 4a), suggesting inhibition of multiple kinases may be
effective in treating HER2+ CTCs. Compared with HER2+ CTCs, HER2− CTCs showed
reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents docetaxel, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5a, c), but increased sensitivity to γ-secretase
inhibitors, which suppress Notch activity (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5a, d). Despite
proteomic enrichment for Aurora B signaling, HER2− CTCs were not differentially sensitive
to Aurora family inhibitors (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplemental Tables 3, 4).

Author Manuscript

The increased NOTCH1 in HER2− CTCs observed by quantitative MS and confirmed by
western blot (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplemental Tables 3, 4) was inversely correlated
with HER2 expression within primary CTCs and CTC lines, shown by scRNA-seq and
immunostaining (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We therefore tested the consequences of
suppressing HER2 or activating Notch signaling in HER2+ CTCs.
Manipulation of NOTCH1 or its downstream effector NFE2L2/NRF2 in cultured HER2+
CTCs did not reduce HER2 expression (Extended Data Fig. 6b). However, inhibition of
HER2 using lapatinib or siRNA led to increased expression of NOTCH1, its ligands JAG1
and DLL1, and Notch-regulated genes HES1, HEY1 and HEY2 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data
Fig. 6c), confirming previous reports from HER2-amplified breast cancer cells6,7 (Extended
Data Fig. 6c). Suppression of HER2 also resulted in increased expression of genes (GCLC,
GGT1, GPX1, GPX4, HMOX1) downstream of Notch-regulated NRF2, a transcriptional
regulator of anti-oxidant/glutathione metabolism pathways8,9 (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Thus,
expression of HER2 in CTCs appears to mediate downregulation of the NOTCH1/NRF2
axis, potentially switching between proliferative and survival-prone phenotypes.

Author Manuscript

In addition to suppressing HER2 directly, we tested additional stimuli capable of modulating
the HER2+/HER2− interconversion. Treatment of HER2+ CTCs with low doses of
docetaxel (1 nM) or induction of oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 10 mM)
induced rapid shifts from HER2+ to HER2− (30% conversion, >70% survival) (Fig. 4d). To
exclude differential cell death, we demonstrated acceleration in the appearance of HER2−
progeny from FACS-purified single HER2+ CTCs (5–9 cells: 45%, >10 cells: 62%) (Fig. 4e
and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Thus, exposure to cytotoxic/oxidative stress mediates a switch
to a less proliferative but more drug resistant phenotype.

To model the potential significance of HER2+/HER2− interconversion in vivo, we generated
orthotopic mammary xenografts from FACS-purified subpopulations and analyzed tumors
before and after treatment with paclitaxel. Purified HER2+ CTCs generated mixed tumors
(88% HER2+, 12% HER2−) and showed dramatic tumor shrinkage following paclitaxel
treatment. The recurrent tumor showed a transient reduction in HER2+ with a corresponding
increase in HER2− composition following chemotherapy (2-weeks: 39% HER2+; 7-weeks:
74% HER2+; Figure 4f). Purified HER2− CTCs also gave rise to a mixed tumor (35%
HER2+, 65% HER2−), but paclitaxel induced only a limited delay in tumor growth with a
minimal effect on HER2 content. Shedding of CTCs was also suppressed by paclitaxel in
HER2+ but not HER2− tumors (Extended Data Fig. 6f). The chemotherapy-induced shift in
HER2 composition was also evident following inoculation of parental CTC cultures
(Untreated 65% HER2+; Post-therapy 30% HER2+; Extended Data Fig. 6g). Finally, we
generated tumors from a 1:1 mixture of GFP-tagged HER2+ and untagged HER2− cells,
demonstrating a shift from GFP+/HER2+ to GFP+/HER2− cells following paclitaxel
treatment (Untreated: 70% GFP+/HER2+, Post-therapy: 42% GFP+/HER2+; Extended Data
Fig. 6h). The potent effect of chemotherapy on HER2+/HER2− phenotypes in vivo may
reflect both reduced drug-sensitivity of HER2− cells, as well as stress-induced HER2+ to
HER2− switching.
Given the demonstrated susceptibility of HER2− CTCs to Notch inhibitors, we combined
paclitaxel with either of two γ-secretase inhibitors (LY-411575; RO4929097) in treating
mice with tumors initiated from parental CTC lines. Compared with paclitaxel alone, the
combination therapy significantly delayed onset of tumor recurrence, while Notch inhibition
alone had no effect on tumor growth (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 6f).

Taken together, we have used primary and cultured CTCs from ER+/HER2− breast cancer
patients who developed metastatic multidrug resistant disease to show that coexisting
distinct HER2+ and HER2− tumor cell subpopulations may interconvert, with striking
consequences for disease progression and drug response. The comparable tumor initiating
potential and similar expression of stem cell marker ALDH1 in HER2+ and HER2− CTCs
suggests underlying tumor cell plasticity in these advanced patient-derived breast CTC lines,
rather than a hierarchical cancer stem cell model as described in drug resistant
subpopulations within established breast cancer cell lines7,10–15. While expression of
NOTCH1 and other embryonic markers has been reported in rare, quiescent cells within
primary breast tumors7,16,17,18, the NOTCH1+ CTCs reported here constitute a major cell
population, exhibiting both persistent cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.
Thus, we propose a dynamic model, in which the equilibrium between HER2+ and HER2−
cells within a heterogeneous tumor population is driven by spontaneous interconversion
between these phenotypes, with the more rapidly proliferating HER2+ cells prevalent under
baseline conditions, and environmental or therapy-induced stress enhancing conversion to
the more resistant HER2− phenotype. Neither molecular profiling nor functional studies
have revealed secreted factors that affect the mutual survival of HER2+ and HER2− CTCs,
but we cannot exclude such additional factors.
Finally, the properties of patient-derived CTC lines established after multiple courses of
therapy provide relevant insight to the treatment of drug-refractory, advanced breast cancer.

While clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in HER2− breast
cancer with acquired HER2+ CTCs1,19–21, our observations indicate that acquisition of
HER2 does not indicate HER2 oncogene dependence and drug susceptibility; instead it
constitutes a marker of a proliferative, multi-RTK state. Furthermore, the interconversion of
chemotherapy-sensitive HER2+/NOTCH1− and NOTCH inhibitor-sensitive HER2−/
NOTCH1+ CTCs suggests that dual treatment, as modeled here, may be required for
effective treatment. Clinical trials to date have had limited success sequentially
administering embryonic pathway inhibitors targeting Hedgehog, Wnt or Notch to inhibit
cancer stem cells following initial chemotherapy16,22–25. The rapid interconversion between
proliferative and drug resistant CTC subpopulations raises the possibility that simultaneous
combination therapy may provide a novel strategy for clinical validation.

Patient Selection and CTC isolation
Patients with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer provided informed consent for deidentified blood collection, as per Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol
(DF/HCC 05-300). Enrolled patients had received multiple courses of therapy, which is
typical in advanced ER+ breast cancer, and we did not have sufficient power in this pilot
study to enable a statistically significant correlation between the number of therapeutic
interventions and the frequency of HER2+ CTCs. Patient matched primary and metastatic
tumor specimens were collected per IRB approved protocol (2002-P-002059), and relevant
tumor source data is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Single CTCs were isolated from fresh whole blood by depleting leukocytes using the
microfluidic CTC-iChip as previously described3. Briefly, whole blood samples were
incubated with biotinylated antibodies against CD45 (R&D Systems, clone 2D1), CD66b
(AbD Serotec, clone 80H3), and CD16 (BD, clone 3G8) followed by incubation with
Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Invitrogen) to achieve magnetic labeling of white blood
cells. This mixture was processed through the CTC-iChip, and the CTCs were stained in
solution with Alexa 488-conjugated antibodies against EpCAM (Cell Signaling Technology,
clone VU1D9) and HER2 (Cell Signaling Technology, clone 29D8 or Janssen R&D) and
identified by imaging flow cytometry (Amnis). Individual CTCs were picked after staining
as described above, and PE-CF594-conjugated antibody against CD45 (BD Biosciences,
clone HI30) was included to stain contaminating leukocytes. CTCs were individually
micromanipulated using a 10 μm transfer tip on an Eppendorf TransferMan NK 2
micromanipulator, transferred into PCR tubes containing RNA protective lysis buffer, and
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as previously described26. Standard CTC enumeration of
fixed samples is performed on the BioView high content imaging system following
Megafunnel fixation and staining with the combination of wide spectrum cytokeratin
(Abcam, ab9377), EpCAM (Cell Signaling Technology, clone VU1D9), EGFR (Cell
Signaling Technology, clone D38B1) and HER2 (Cell Signaling Technology, clone 29D8)
antibodies.
For mouse xenograft studies, blood was collected via cardiac puncture and ~1mL of blood

Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Tissues were sectioned, and slides were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol
for 20 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Tissues were permeabilized, and
antigen retrieval was performed in 1X citrate buffer (pH 6) for 15 minutes. Slides were
washed and blocked for 30 minutes with 5% Goat serum. Primary HER2 (Cell Signaling,
29D8) or GFP (Living Colors AV 632381) antibodies were diluted 1:75 or 1:250 in DAKO
antibody diluent and samples were incubated for one hour at room temperature. Slides were
incubated with HRP anti-rabbit antibody (EnVision + DAKO) for 30 minutes. After washing
with PBS, the peroxidase reaction was performed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) from
Vector lab kits for 10 minutes. Cells were counterstained with Gill’s #2 hematoxylin for 10–
15 seconds, dehydrated with ethanol and cleared with xylene before mounting. Images
represent at least 5 independent fields from 8 tumors per condition.
Fluorescence-in-situ Hybridization (FISH)

Author Manuscript

FISH was performed as described previously27,28. Briefly, 5-μm sections of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor samples were deparaffinized, hydrated, and pretreated with 0.1%
pepsin for 1–2 hours. Slides were then washed in 2x saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC),
dehydrated, air dried, and co-denatured at 80°C for 5 minutes with a mixture of CEP17 and
HER2 probes and hybridized at 40°C overnight using the Hybrite Hybridization System
(Abbott). Two minute post-hybridization washes were performed in 2x SSC/0.3%NP40 at
72°C followed by a 1 min wash in 2x SSC at room temperature. Slides were mounted with
Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Entire sections were observed with an Olympus BX61 fluorescent microscope equipped
with a charge-coupled device camera and analyzed with Cytovision software (Applied
Imaging, Santa Clara, CA).

Author Manuscript

The HER2 and CEP17 signals were quantified in 50 randomly selected, non-overlapping
nuclei, and mean numbers of HER2 and CEP17 copies per nucleus were calculated. HER2
was considered amplified when the HER2:CEP17 ratio was ≥2.0 or HER2 signals per nuclei
was >6 following the guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of
American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP)29. The probes used in this study consisted of
centromeric CEP: 17p11.1-q11.1, spectrum aqua (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) and
locus-specific identifier (LSI) probes derived from bacterial artificial chromosome
RP11-94L15 (17q12-17q21.1, spectrum orange probe (CHORI, Oakland, CA).
CTC Cell Culture
CTC cultures were grown in suspension in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) in tumor
sphere medium [(RPMI-1640, EGF (20ng/mL), bFGF (20ng/mL), 1X B27, 1X antibiotic/
antimycotic (Life Technologies)] under hypoxic (4% O2) conditions. The breast CTC cell
lines, Brx-42, Brx-82 and Brx-142, were derived from CTCs isolated using the CTC-iChip

as previously described4. CTC cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma, using the
mycoplasma detection kit (MycoAlert, Lonza), and were authenticated by RNA-seq, MS and
DNA-seq (1000 gene mutation panel).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
Cells were trypsinized into single-cell suspensions, resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt
solution (HBSS), and incubated with Anti-HER2/NEU APC (BD, clone 42 c-erbB-2), AntiHER2 FITC (Janssen R & D) or Annexin V FITC (BD, clone RUO) antibodies for 20 min at
4°C. Unbound antibodies were washed from cells using HBSS. For analytical flow, cells
were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using a Laser BD Fortessa instrument.
For sterile live-cell flow cytometry, cells were sorted using a Laser BD FACS Aria Fusion
Cell Sorter, BSL2+. FACS plots are representative of at least 2 independent experiments
performed within 6-months of culture initiation (Fig. 1d, 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1f, 3a).

Sequencing Analysis of Genomic DNA

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA extracted from CTC-derived cell lines was sequenced using a multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology called Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) for
single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion (indel) detection using next
generation sequencing (NGS) as previously described30. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated
from cell lines and then sheared with the Covaris M220 instrument, followed by end-repair,
adenylation, and ligation with an adapter. A sequencing library targeting hotspots and exons
in 39 commonly mutated, cancer-associated genes was generated using two hemi-nested
PCR reactions. Illumina MiSeq 2 × 151 base paired-end sequencing results were aligned to
the hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM31. MuTect32 and a laboratorydeveloped insertion/deletion analysis algorithm were used for SNV and indel variant
detection, respectively. This assay has been validated to detect SNV and indel variants at 5%
allelic frequency or higher in target regions with sufficient read coverage.
Lentivirus Production, Infection and siRNA knockdown of CTC Cell Lines

Author Manuscript

To produce replication-incompetent lentivirus, 293T cells were cotransfected with either
Lenti-Luc-GFP or Notch intracellular domain-pcw107 (Addgene #64621) constructs in
combination with REV, VSVG, PDML or pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene) using
Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, growth medium was
replenished. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hours post-transfection, concentrated with
Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech), and viral pellets were resuspended in 400 μl base medium.
CTC cultures were infected overnight with 100 μl lentivirus in 6 μg/ml Polybrene.
Puromycin (3 μg/ml) was used to select transduced cells over a period of 7 days. Puromycin

CTC lines were spun onto poly-L-lysine-functionalized glass slides with Spintrap, fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X, and stained with nuclear 4,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain, HER2 (Cell Signaling Technologies, clone 29D8),
Ki67 (Zymed), Cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, clone D3E9) and/or
NOTCH1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, clone D1E11) antibodies. Secondary antibodies
were conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 (Life Technologies) and
fluorescence was measured using the Nikon 90-I fluorescent microscope. Images are
representative of at least 3 independent images per sample.
Single Cell Lineage Tracing and Confocal Microscopy
Single HER2+ or HER2− CTCs were flow sorted in 96-well white-walled plates (Corning)
using Laser BD FACS Aria Fusion Cell Sorter, BSL2+. Single cell, 1, 3, 5–9, 10–20 and
<20-cell clones were analyzed for heterogeneity in HER2 expression via staining with
antibodies against EpCAM (FITC labeled; Cell Signaling, clone VU1D9) and HER2 (APC
labeled, BD, clone 42 c-erbB-2). Imaging and image processing was performed sequentially
with the confocal microscope (Zeiss 710 Laser Scanning Confocal) followed by FIJI (Image
J). Images are representative of at least 20 independent images per colony size.

Bioinformatic Analysis
Bioinformatic analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data

Author Manuscript

Determination of reads-per-million (RPM): Trimmomatic was used to crop reads lengths
to 50 nucleotides, and to remove the TruSeq3-PE-2 Illumina adapters. The paired-end reads
were then aligned using tophat2 and bowtie1 with the no-novel-juncs argument set with
human genome version hg19 and transcriptome defined by the hg19 genes.gtf table from
http://genome.ucsc.edu. Reads that did not align or aligned to multiple locations were
discarded. The number of reads aligning to each gene was then determined using htseqcount. Samples that had less than 105 reads were discarded. The read count for each gene
was divided by the total counts assigned to all genes and multiplied by one million to form
the reads-per-million (RPM). Samples for which the expression of the white blood cell
marker PTPRC (CD45) was greater than 10 RPM were discarded. Single-cell RNA-seq data
has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE75367.
Bimodality: To establish that the distribution of HER2 expression in CTCs is multi-modal,
we applied the Hartigans’ dip test as implemented in the diptest R-package to the
log10(RPM + 1) values with 10 RPM as the threshold to define HER2- versus HER2+ CTCs.
To establish that the distribution has two modes and not more, we applied the density
function of R with default values to the log10(RPM + 1) values.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of RNA-seq and Quantitative Proteomics Data: Based
on the analysis of bimodality above, we defined HER2+ samples to be those for which the
expression of HER2 exceeded 10 RPM and defined the rest to be HER2−. For the mass
spectrometric data, enrichment of signaling pathways was determined by submitting the
average log2 fold-change in protein abundance between the HER2-high and HER2-low
samples to the pre-ranked function of the Broad Institute’s GSEA software using gene sets
in the Pathway Interaction Database (PID) and KEGG as curated in version 4 of the Broad
Institute’s MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/). Pathway enrichment for
the RNA-Seq of the CTCs was done the same way with the exception that the full RPM
matrix for the CTCs and the HER2+ versus HER2− distinction was input to the GSEA
software instead of log2 fold-change.
Quantitative Proteomics

CTC Cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer containing 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES
(pH 8.5), 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, Roche Complete Protease
Inhibitor EDTA-free tablets, and 3 % sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cells were lysed by passing
them 10 times through a 21-gauge needle, and the lyses were prepared for analysis on the
mass spectrometer essentially as described previously33. Briefly, reduction and thiol
alkylation were followed by purifying the proteins using MeOH/CHCl3 precipitation.
Protein digest was performed with Lys-C and trypsin, and peptides were labeled with
TMT-10plex reagents (Thermo Scientific)34 and fractionated by basic pH reversed phase
chromatography. Multiplexed quantitative proteomics was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion
mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a Simultaneous Precursor Selection (SPS)
based MS3 method35. MS2 spectra were assigned using a SEQUEST-based proteomics
analysis platform36. Based on the target-decoy database search strategy37 and employing
linear discriminant analysis and posterior error histogram sorting, peptide and protein
assignments were filtered to a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1 %36. Peptides with
sequences that were contained in more than one protein sequence from the UniProt database
were assigned to the protein with most matching peptides36. TMT reporter ion intensities
were extracted as that of the most intense ion within a 0.03 Th window around the predicted
reporter ion intensities in the collected MS3 spectra. Only MS3 with an average signal-tonoise value larger than 40 per reporter ion as well as with an isolation specificity33 larger
than 0.75 were considered for quantification. A two-step normalization of the protein TMTintensities was performed by first normalizing the protein intensities over all acquired TMT
channels for each protein based on the median average protein intensity calculated for all
proteins. To correct for slight mixing errors of the peptide mixture from each sample, a
median of the normalized intensities was calculated from all protein intensities in each TMT
channel, and protein intensities were normalized to the median value of these median
intensities.
Protein interactions were extracted from the String database (High confidence score >
0.7)38. Overlapping proteins were assigned to the pathway with the greatest number of
proteins, and enriched PID pathways were ranked by log10(p-value) to nearest thousandth.

Drug Screens
Drugs were obtained from the MGH Center for Molecular Therapeutics and are listed in
Supplemental Table 6 and were chosen due to common clinical use for treatment of breast
cancer or unique targeting of epigenetic/stem cell pathways. One thousand cells were seeded
in tumor sphere media in 384-well ultra-low attachment plates in triplicate wells on
duplicate plates 24 hours prior to the addition of drugs. Three independent drug
concentrations centered on the reported IC50 were used (Supplemental Table 6). Cell
viability was assayed 6-days following drug exposure with CellTiter-Glo (Promega) and was
normalized to corresponding untreated controls39.

In compliance with ethical regulations and approved by the animal protocol (IACUC
2010N000006), six-week old female NSG (NOD. Cg-Prkscsdid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice from
Jackson Laboratories were anesthetized with isofluorane, and GFP-LUC labeled CTCs
(200,000, 20,000 and/or limiting dilutions as low as 200 cells) or 50:50 mixed CTCs (GFPLUC+/HER2+: Untagged/HER2−, and the converse) were injected into the 4th right
mammary fat pad. A 90-day release 0.72mg estrogen pellet (Innovative Research of
America) was implanted subcutaneously behind the neck of each mouse. Tumor growth was
monitored weekly by in vivo imaging using IVIS Lumina II (PerkinElmer) following
intraperitoneal injection (150 μl/animal) of D-Luciferin substrate (Sigma). For in vivo drug
sensitivity testing, Paclitaxel (10mg/kg) was administered weekly via IV injection for four
consecutive weeks. Notch inhibitors (Notch2) LY-411575 (10mg/kg) or (Notch2) RO429097
(10mg/kg) were administered daily (5 days on/2 days off) via oral gavage in 2% solvent (2%
sodium caroboxymethyl cellulose) for four consecutive weeks. No animal randomization or
blinding was used for these mouse studies. All animal studies used 8 mice per condition to
ensure sufficient statistical power.

Figure 4. Cooperative targeting of HER2+ and HER2− CTC subpopulations suppresses tumor
growth

Author Manuscript

(a) HER2+ CTCs show no change in sensitivity to lapatinib alone, compared with matched
HER2− CTCs (Brx-142), but have increased sensitivity to combined HER2 and IGF1R
(BMS-754807) inhibitors; n=6; S.D (error bar). (b) HER2− CTCs demonstrate reduced
chemosensitivity (docetaxel) but have enhanced sensitivity to Notch inhibition
(BMS-708163, Notchi1), compared with HER2+ CTCs; n=6; S.D. (error bar). (c) Inhibition
of HER2 with lapatinib or siRNA-mediated knockdown in HER2+ CTCs (Brx-82) results in
dose-dependent increase of Notch-related genes: NOTCH1, JAG1, DLL1, HES1, HEY1,
HEY2; p <0.05; n=6; S.E.M (error bar). (d) Rapid emergence (96 hrs) of HER2− CTCs
