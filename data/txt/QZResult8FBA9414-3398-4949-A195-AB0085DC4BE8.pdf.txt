Abstract
The semisynthetic vitamin E derivative alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid (a-TEA) induces tumor cell apoptosis
and may offer a simple adjuvant supplement for cancer therapy if its mechanisms can be better understood. Here
we report that a-TEA also triggers tumor cell autophagy and that it improves cross-presentation of tumor
antigens to the immune system. a-TEA stimulated both apoptosis and autophagy in murine mammary and lung
cancer cells and inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis enhanced a-TEA–induced autophagy. Cell exposure
to a-TEA generated double-membrane–bound vesicles indicative of autophagosomes, which efﬁciently crossprimed antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells. Notably, vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with a-TEA–generated
autophagosomes reduced lung metastases and increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our
ﬁndings suggest that both autophagy and apoptosis signaling programs are activated during a-TEA–induced
tumor cell killing. We suggest that the ability of a-TEA to stimulate autophagy and enhance cross-priming of
CD8þ T cells might be exploited as an adjuvant strategy to improve stimulation of antitumor immune responses.

Introduction
Alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid (a-TEA) is a stable semisynthetic ether derivative of naturally occurring vitamin E
(a-tocopherol). Although vitamin E has been pursued as an
anticancer agent because of its antioxidant properties, the
available epidemiologic data as well as in vivo studies in
experimental animal tumor models have showed a limited
role for vitamin E in cancer prevention or control (1–3) and
may even be harmful as shown in the aborted SELECT clinical
trial that examined the effect of high-dose vitamin E on
prostate cancer (4). a-TEA is derived from vitamin E by a
chemical modiﬁcation, which involves the replacement of the
hydroxyl group at the number 6 carbon of the phenolic ring of
the chroman head by an acetic acid residue linked by an ether
bond (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 5). This modiﬁcation renders
a-TEA, in contrast to vitamin E, redox silent but active against

tumors of various origins (5–7). The presence of a noncleavable
ether bond ensures the stability of a-TEA, allowing it to be
delivered via the oral route in a biologically active form. We
reported for the ﬁrst time that when incorporated into mouse
chow, and supplied to mice in the diet, a-TEA signiﬁcantly
inhibited the growth of transplanted and spontaneously-arising metastatic breast cancers and dramatically reduced the
incidence of spontaneous lung metastases before and after
primary tumor establishment without overt toxicity (7, 8).
Reports from numerous laboratories including our own have
showed that apoptosis is a primary mode of a-TEA–induced
tumor cell death (7–10), a process that is initiated by mitochondrial depolarization followed by release of cytochrome c
to the cytosol and activation of the caspase execution pathway
(reviewed in ref. 11). However, the observation that the antitumor activity of a-TEA cannot be completely blocked using
pan or caspase-speciﬁc inhibitors (12, 13) suggests the involvement of additional pathway(s) in a-TEA–mediated tumor cell
killing.
Autophagy is normally a protective survival mechanism
used by cells undergoing various forms of stress, including
chemotherapy, to sequester, process, and recycle damaged
cellular organelles and misfolded and long-lived proteins to
provide nutrients to the cell (reviewed in ref. 14). It has recently
become clear that apoptosis and autophagy are not mutually
exclusive events (reviewed in ref. 15) and that both could lead
to cell death (14, 16). The formation of autophagosomes
involves 3 major steps: The ﬁrst (initiation stage) is the
de novo formation of an isolation membrane, which is regulated by the mTOR and the Beclin-1 (Atg6)/class III phospohoinsitol-3 kinase (PI3K) complex. The second stage involves
elongation and expansion of the phagophore to enclose

cytosolic components including damaged organelles and misfolded proteins and requires the conjugation of Atg5 to Atg12.
The ﬁnal stage is the formation of a mature autophagosome
ready for fusion with lysosomal vesicles, which requires conversion of soluble LC3-I (Atg8) to the membrane-bound form
LC3-II (17).
During autophagy, cellular components including viral or
endogenous tumor-associated antigens (TAA) become available for cross-presentation by professional antigen-presenting
cells (APC) to prime antigen- or tumor-speciﬁc T-cell
responses (14, 18). Although autophagy is known to play an
essential role in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II–restricted antigen presentation (19), only recently has its
role in MHC class I–restricted stimulation of CD8þ T cells
(cross-presentation) become appreciated (18, 20).
In this study, we investigated whether a-TEA stimulates
tumor cell autophagy and enhances antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DC). We show that a-TEA induces
tumor cell autophagy and that the a-TEA–derived autophagosome-enriched supernatant fraction (a-TAGS) stimulates efﬁcient antigen cross-presentation. We describe here a novel
mechanism of immune activation by a-TEA that involves the
stimulation of tumor cell autophagy and enhanced crosspriming of CD8þ T cells.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of a-TEA
a-TEA [(2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-(2R-(4R,8R,12-trimethyltridecyl)
chroman-6-yloxy) acetic acid)] was synthesized using a combination of previously described methods (2, 5) and vesiculated
a-TEA (Va-TEA) was generated as previously described (8).
Mice
Six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories. OT-I TCR transgenic
breeders were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. CTTCR transgenic breeders were kindly provided by Dr. Jill E.
Slansky (University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine,
Denver, CO; ref. 21). All mice were maintained and used in
accordance with the Principles of Animal Care (NIH publication No. 85–23) and all studies were approved by the EACRI
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor cell lines and cell culture
The poorly immunogenic and highly metastatic 4T1 tumor
cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Fred Miller of the Michigan
Cancer Foundation (Detroit, MI). The Lewis Lung carcinoma
(3LL) cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Lea Eisenbach of
the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel).
DNA construction and transduction of cell lines
3LL or 4T1 tumor cells were transduced with lentiviral
vectors that either expressed the ubiquitin-methionine green
ﬂuorescence protein-ovalbumin (Ub-M-GFP-OVA) antigen
or LC3-GFP as previously described (18). Ub-M-GFP-OVA
antigen- or LC3-GFP-expressing cells were enriched for GFP
positivity by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting. LC3-GFP was
transiently expressed in 3LL tumor cells after transfection

using Lipofectamine-LTX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
4T1 tumor cells stably transduced with Atg12-speciﬁc short
hairpin RNA (shRNA; 4T1-Atg12shRNA) and scrambled (control) shRNA (4T1-CTRLshRNA) were generated previously.
Atg12-speciﬁc shRNA expression is doxycycline-inducible and
coexpressed with red ﬂuorescent protein, which was monitored by epiﬂuorescence. Atg12 gene knockdown was determined by Western immunoblotting. The transduced cells (4T1LC3-GFP, 4T1-OVA-GFP, 4T1-Atg12shRNA, 4T1-CTRLshRNA,
and 3LL-OVA-GFP) were maintained in culture medium containing 2 mg/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Quantiﬁcation of LC3-GFP punctae
4T1-LC3-GFP or 3LL-LC3-GFP cells were cultured overnight
on Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The
cells were then treated with Va-TEA or 100 mmol/L trehalose
(Sigma-Aldrich) with the addition of 10 nmol/L baﬁlomycin-A1
(Sigma-Aldrich) for the last 2 hours of incubation. Cells were
ﬁxed and the fraction of punctate-positive cells per ﬁeld of view
was determined by counting punctate-positive and total number of cells in 12 to 30 random high-powered ﬁelds (100) of
view per treatment by epiﬂuorescence microscopy.
Apoptosis assay
Tumor cells were pretreated with 50 mmol/L zVAD-fmk
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours before the addition of 40 mmol/L
Va-TEA. Nonadherent and adherent cells were collected
using 10 mmol/L EDTA, pooled and stained using the
APC-Annexin-V/7AAD Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells
positively staining with APC-Annexin-V were considered to
be apoptotic.
Clonogenic cell survival assay
4T1-Atg12shRNA or 4T1-CTRLshRNA tumor cells (1.25  105)
were cultured with 2 mg/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for
72 hours to induce Atg12 knockdown and were then treated
with 60 mmol/L Va-TEA. After 24 hours, nonadherent and
adherent cells were collected (300  g, 5 minutes). Cell number
and viability were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion
and 1.25  102, 2.5  102, 5  102, 103, and 104 viable cells
(trypan blue negative) from each treatment group were plated
in triplicate (100 mm dishes) and incubated (7% CO2, 37 C)
for 7 days. The resulting colonies were methanol-ﬁxed, stained
with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich), and counted. The surviving cell
fraction was determined as previously described (7).
Generation and collection of a-TAGS
Tumor cells were treated with 20 mmol/L (4T1) or 80 mmol/L
(3LL) Va-TEA for 24 hours. The culture supernatant was
collected and cleared of dead cells and cell debris (300  g,
10 minutes). To obtain the autophagosome enriched fraction
(a-TAGS), the supernatant containing the crude large vesicles
was centrifuged at 10,000  g for 15 minutes. The a-TAGS
pellet was resuspended in PBS and protein content was
determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). For the control cells [vehicle (PBS)-

treated] in which cells were not dying, culture medium was
collected from twice as many cells. To block autophagy, cells
were pretreated with 10 mmol/L 3-methyladenine (3-MA;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 hours before a-TEA treatment.
Transmission electron microscopy
a-TAGS was prepared from 4T1 or 3LL tumor cells treated
with 20 or 80 mmol/L Va-TEA respectively, for 24 hours and
prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as
described in the Supplementary Methods. Microscopy was
conducted at 60 kV on a Philips Morgagne TEM (FEI Inc.),
equipped with a charge-coupled device camera and images
were collected at original magniﬁcations of 1,000 to 37,000.
Western blot analysis
To detect LC3 conversion, 3LL or 4T1 tumor cells were
treated with 40 or 60 mmol/L Va-TEA or 400 nmol/L rapamycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 hours with the addition of baﬁlomycinA1 (Sigma-Aldrich) for the last 2 hours of culture. Cell lysates
were prepared using Complete Lysis-M Buffer (Roche Applied
Sciences) containing protease inhibitors. For in vivo LC3
conversion, 4T1 tumor–bearing mice received a-TEA in the
diet (6 mg/mouse/day) for 5 days. Subsequently, tumors were
resected and lysed using CelLytic Mammalian Tissue Lysis
Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors and a
rotor-stator homogenizer. To detect Beclin-1 and cleavage of
nuclear PARP, tumor cells were preincubated with zVAD-fmk
(80 mmol/L) for 2 hours before treatment with a-TEA (80
mmol/L) for 16 hours. To detect Atg12, 4T1-Atg12shRNA and
4T1-CTRLshRNA were cultured with 2 mg/mL doxycycline for
72 hours before a-TEA treatment. All lysates were clariﬁed
(14,000  g, 15 minutes, 4 C) and protein content was determined by BCA (Thermo Scientiﬁc). After electrophoretic separation, proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting.
To detect endogenous LC3 in a-TAGS, a-TAGS was lysed in
RIPA buffer and clariﬁed. Protein content was determined by
BCA (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and equal amounts (5 mg) of protein
were electrophoretically separated and LC3 was detected by
Western immunoblotting and quantiﬁed using Image-J software (22).
Cross-presentation assay
For the in vitro cross-presentation assay, splenic DCs were
generated as previously described (23). OT-I splenocytes
were carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled
(5 mmol/L) and coincubated with antigen-loaded DCs
(20 mg a-TAGS/1  106 DC; 6 hours) in 10 mL tissue culture
ﬂat tubes (Techno Plastic Products AG) for 4 or 6 days. CFSE
dilution was measured by ﬂow cytometry as previously
described (18). To determine in vivo cross-presentation,
a-TAGS (20 mg protein) was injected into both inguinal lymph
nodes of naive C57BL/6 mice. On the same day, 3  106 CFSElabeled Thy1.1þ OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred by
intravenous injection. Lymph nodes were collected 5 days later,
and single-cell suspensions were prepared and CFSE dilution
of Thy1.1þ CD8þ cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry. Data
were acquired and analyzed using BD CellQuest Pro software
(BD Biosciences).

IFN-g ELISA
4T1-Atg12shRNA and 4T1-CTRLshRNA cells were incubated
with 2 mg/mL doxycycline for 72 hours before preparation of
a-TAGS as described earlier. DCs (3  106) were pulsed with 20
mg a-TAGS for 6 hours, and washed 3 times. T cells (3  106)
isolated from CT-TCR mice were then coincubated with the DC
for 48 hours and IFN-g secretion was detected by ELISA
(eBioscience).
Generation of DCs and animal vaccination studies
For the 4T1 tumor model experiments, bone marrow–
derived DC (24) were either left untreated (nonpulsed-DC,
npDC), pulsed overnight with 40 mg a-TAGS per 1  106 DC
(a-TAGS-DC) or tumor cell freeze–thaw (3 cycles) lysate
(Lysate-DC) at a ratio of 3 tumor cell equivalents per DC.
Subsequently, the DC were matured by adding 200 U/mL TNFa (PeproTech) for 24 hours. 4T1 tumor cells (5  104) were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the right mammary fat pad
of female BALB/c mice. The mice then received s.c. vaccinations of 1  106 a-TAGS-DC, Lysate-DC, or npDC on days 7, 9,
and 11 posttumor injection. Mice injected subcutaneously with
a-TAGS (40 mg) were included as controls. For the 3LL experiments, DC were left untreated (npDC), or pulsed with either 20
mg a-TAGS per 3  106 DC (a-TAGS-DC) or tumor cell freezethaw lysate (Lysate-DC) in the presence of 200 ng/mL IFN-g
(PeproTech). 3LL tumor cells (2  105) were injected intravenously into female C57BL/6 mice. On day 3 posttumor injection, the mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with 3  106
a-TAGS-DC, Lysate-DC, npDC, or 20 mg a-TAGS. Visible
metastatic nodules in the lungs were enumerated on day 28.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance of differences among data sets was
assessed by Student t test for pair wise comparisons or for
comparisons of multiple groups by 1-way ANOVA with Tukey
HSD test. Survival was assessed according to Kaplan and Meier
including log-rank test. All analyses were done using Prism
software (GraphPad). Probability values (P) of 0.05 were
considered indicative of signiﬁcant differences.

Results
a-TEA stimulates autophagy in tumor cells
To assess whether a-TEA stimulates autophagy in tumor
cells, 3LL and murine mammary tumor (4T1) cells were treated
with a-TEA and the levels of LC3-I and LC3-II were determined
by Western immunoblotting. Induction of autophagy is associated with conversion of the cytosolic LC3-I to the membranebound LC3-II (17). The data show that a-TEA induced a 7-fold
increase in LC3-II conversion in a-TEA–treated 3LL tumor
cells (Fig. 1A). LC3-II conversion in a-TEA–treated 4T1 tumor
cells was less robust and was 3-fold higher than vehicle (PBS)treated cells (Fig. 1C). As with a-TEA, 4T1 tumor cells were also
less responsive than 3LL tumor cells to rapamycin, a known
autophagy inducer. To conﬁrm autophagy induction in
a-TEA–treated tumor cells, we assessed the formation of
LC3-GFP punctae in LC3-GFP transgene-expressing 3LL and
4T1 cells. a-TEA treatment caused a dose-dependent increase

a-TEA–Induced Tumor Cell Autophagy and Cross-Presentation

in LC3 punctae formation indicative of autophagy (25) in both
3LL (Fig. 1B) and 4T1 (Fig. 1D) tumor cells. Punctae formation
in a-TEA–treated 3LL cells was similar or higher than punctae
formation induced by the known autophagy inducer trehalose
(Fig. 1B). a-TEA treatment of 4T1 cells also signiﬁcantly
increased punctae formation to levels comparable to trehalose
(Fig. 1D). To determine if a-TEA induces autophagy in vivo,
4T1 tumor–bearing animals received an oral dose of a-TEA
(6 mg/day) that we have previously shown to reduce tumor
growth and prolong survival (2, 7). LC3 conversion in the tumor
was determined after 5 days of a-TEA treatment and we found
approximately 3-fold increased LC3-II levels in 4T1 mammary
tumors from a-TEA–treated mice compared with untreated
mice (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these 3 lines of evidence
indicate that a-TEA induced autophagy in tumor cells.
Autophagy precedes apoptosis during a-TEA treatment
On the basis of the documented property of a-TEA as a
potent apoptosis-inducer (7, 8, 12, 13, 26), we compared the
kinetics of apoptosis and autophagy induction during a-TEA
treatment. The data (Fig. 2A and B) show that a-TEA–induced
autophagy precedes apoptosis. At 4 hours of a-TEA treatment
when no change in the percentage of apoptotic cells is observed
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A), the percentage
of punctate-positive cells, indicative of autophagy is 25%

a-TEA–induced autophagy decreases tumor cell survival
Because autophagy can either be protective or lead to tumor
cell death (14, 29), we assessed the impact of a-TEA treatment
on tumor cell survival during autophagy inhibition. This was

(Fig. 2B); peak levels of apoptosis and autophagy are observed
at 16 hours of a-TEA treatment. Our observation that a-TEA
stimulates autophagy together with a recent report that treatment of stressed cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVADfmk enhanced autophagy (27, 28), prompted us to evaluate the
effect of apoptosis inhibition on a-TEA–induced autophagy.
For this purpose, 4T1-LC3-GFP cells were treated with a-TEA
in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. a-TEA
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, which reached a maximum at 16 hours, was inhibited 55% by zVAD-fmk. In
contrast, increase in the percentage of LC3-GFP punctatepositive cells, which was detected as early as 4 hours after
a-TEA treatment (Fig. 2B) was enhanced by zVAD-fmk treatment. It has recently been reported that apoptosis induction
may inhibit autophagy via regulation of Beclin-1 levels (27, 28).
Therefore, we determined Beclin-1 protein levels in a-TEA–
treated tumor cells. The data (Fig. 2C) show a modest reduction in Beclin-1 protein in a-TEA–treated tumor cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with zVADfmk seems to restore Beclin-1 expression (Fig. 2C).

staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and Annexin-V-PE. B, 4T1-LC3-GFP cells were treated as in A, and formation of LC3-GFP punctae was

Figure 3. a-TEA–induced autophagy decreases tumor cell survival. A, the autophagy pathway was inhibited by doxycycline-inducible shRNA knockdown
of Atg12 protein expression in 4T1 tumor cells (4T1-Atg12shRNA). 4T1-CTRLshRNA cells that express a nonspeciﬁc shRNA were included as control.
After 72-hour doxycycline incubation, Atg12 protein levels were determined by Western immunoblot detection of the Atg12-Atg5 complex using an Atg
12-speciﬁc antibody. B, the cells were then treated with a-TEA (60 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Nonadherent and adherent cells were collected, and the
surviving fraction (SF) was determined after 7 days of culture without a-TEA. Mean SF  SD from 4 independent experiments is shown. GAPDH,

achieved by doxycycline-induced shRNA knockdown of the
autophagy pathway gene, Atg12 (Fig. 3A), which is essential for
the membrane extension step that leads to autophagosomal
vesicle formation (14). Tumor cell survival was assessed using a
long-term clonogenicity assay, which provides the most accurate assessment of cell death. a-TEA treatment concurrent
with Atg12 knockdown signiﬁcantly increased colony formation of a-TEA–treated cells (P > 0.0131), suggesting that
autophagy contributed to a-TEA–mediated tumor cell death
(Fig. 3B).
a-TAGS is an efﬁcient antigen carrier
for cross-presentation
Given that we (18, 30) and others (19, 31) have previously
shown that autophagy induction in tumor cells can play a
pivotal role in cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigen,
we hypothesized that a-TEA–generated autophagosomes augment antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell activation. We ﬁrst determined if a-TEA treatment of 4T1 and 3LL tumor cells resulted
in release of autophagosomes. Examination of the precleared,
high-speed (10,000  g) pellet fraction revealed the presence of
double-membrane structures (Fig. 4A) typical of autophagosomes (25). In addition, immunoblot analysis showed that the
autophagosome-enriched fraction (a-TAGS) contained elevated amounts of LC3-II (Fig. 4B).
To determine whether a-TAGS is an antigen carrier and can
stimulate cross-presentation to CD8þ T cells, we pulsed DCs
with a-TAGS collected from 3LL or 4T1 tumor cells that stably
express the OVA protein and tested their ability to stimulate
OVA-speciﬁc transgenic OT-I CD8þ T cells (Fig. 5A). DCs
pulsed with a-TAGS from 3LL-OVA and 4T1-OVA cells stimulated vigorous OT-I CD8þ T-cell proliferation with over 60% of
T cells undergoing cell division (Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, the
equivalent high-speed fraction from a-TEA–treated parental
4T1 or 3LL tumor cells (data not shown) or untreated OVAexpressing (4T1-OVA, 3LL-OVA) cells did not signiﬁcantly
stimulate OT-I T-cell proliferation compared with unpulsed

DC (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, a-TAGS from OVA-expressing
tumor cells stimulated proliferation of OT-I CD8þ T cells in
an a-TEA dose-dependent manner. Peak T-cell stimulation
was achieved using 3LL- and 4T1–derived a-TAGS after treatment with 80 and 20 mmol/L a-TEA, respectively (data not
shown). This ﬁnding suggests that a-TAGS is an efﬁcient
carrier of tumor antigens for cross-presentation.
Tumor cell autophagy plays an important role in a-TAGS
activation of CD8þ T cells
We next conﬁrmed the role of autophagy in cross-presentation of a-TAGS by blocking tumor cell autophagy using 3MA, which inhibits class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
required for initiation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by
3-MA signiﬁcantly inhibited OT-I CD8þ T-cell activation by
a-TAGS obtained from both 3LL and 4T1 tumor cells (Fig. 6A).
To further consolidate the role of autophagy in CD8þ T-cell
activation, a-TAGS was collected from doxycycline-treated
4T1-Atg12shRNA tumor cells in which the autophagy pathway
was inhibited by RNA interference–mediated knockdown of
Atg12. Activation of CT-TCR CD8þ T that are speciﬁc for the
AH1 peptide derived from the envelope (GP70) of an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus in 4T1 tumor cells (21),
by a-TAGS–pulsed DC was monitored by measuring IFN-g
levels in the culture supernatant. Inhibition of autophagy by
Atg12 gene knockdown dramatically diminished IFN-g production by CT-TCR CD8þ T cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, CT-TCR
CD8þ T cells stimulated with DCs pulsed with a-TAGS isolated
from cells expressing nonsilencing shRNA (4T1-CTRLshRNA)
stimulated equivalent amounts of IFN-g in the absence or
presence of doxycycline (Fig. 6B).
Antitumor efﬁcacy of a-TAGS–pulsed DC vaccination
Following our ﬁndings that a-TEA induces tumor cell
autophagy and that autophagosomes derived from a-TEA–
treated tumor cells are antigen carriers that stimulate crosspresentation in vitro, we wanted to ﬁrst evaluate whether

(P < 0.05) compared with the DC alone (npDC), a-TAGS alone,
or DC pulsed with freeze-thaw tumor cell lysate (Lysate-DC)
groups. After these encouraging results, we wanted to determine if a-TAGS-DC vaccination is also efﬁcacious against
established tumors. For this purpose, 4T1 mammary tumor–
bearing mice received 3 subcutaneous a-TAGS-DC injections.
The data (Fig. 7C) show that a-TAGS-DC treatment reduced
the mean tumor size by 37% to 110 mm2 from 175 mm2 mean
tumor size in untreated mice. Lysate-DC and a-TAGS vaccination resulted in 34% and 32% tumor size reduction, respectively; npDC vaccination had a minimal effect on tumor growth
(148 mm2). In addition, a-TAGS-DC treatment signiﬁcantly (P
< 0.05) prolonged the median survival to 37 days posttumor
injection compared with 29 days median survival of control
mice (Fig. 7D). Injections of npDC or a-TAGS alone had no
effect on survival (median survival in both groups was 31 days).
Lysate-DC vaccination prolonged the median survival to
35 days.

Figure 4. The high-speed (10,000  g) supernatant fraction from a-TEA–
treated tumor cells contains autophagosomes. A, 3LL or 4T1 tumor cells
were treated with 80 or 20 mmol/L a-TEA for 24 or 48 hours, respectively.
The cell culture supernatant was collected, and dead cells and debris
were removed by centrifugation at 300  g for 10 minutes. Subsequently,
the low-speed supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000  g for 15 minutes,
and the high-speed pellet was examined by TEM. Double-membrane
vesicles (arrows) with a variety of morphology were present. Their sizes
ranged between 100 nm and 1 mm. Images were collected at original
magniﬁcations of 1,000 to 37,000. B, the high-speed fractions from
untreated and a-TEA–treated 3LL or 4T1 cells were solubilized in lysis
buffer, and equal amounts of protein (5 mg) were electrophoretically
separated, and the autophagosome marker, LC3-II, was detected by
Western immunoblotting.

a-TAGS can induce antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell proliferation
in vivo. We found that a-TAGS isolated from 3LL-OVA and 4T1OVA cells that was injected into the inguinal lymph nodes of
naive mice induced proliferation of over 90% and 50% of
adoptively transferred OT-I CD8þ T cells respectively, suggesting a-TAGS was efﬁciently cross-presented to CD8þ T cells in
vivo (Fig. 7A). We next determined the impact of a-TAGS–
pulsed DC (a-TAGS-DC) vaccination on the growth of experimental 3LL lung metastases. Mice were injected intravenously
with 3LL tumor cells, received a-TAGS-DC vaccinations 3 days
later, and visible lung metastases were enumerated 28 day
posttumor injection (Fig. 7B). The results show that a-TAGSDC vaccination signiﬁcantly reduced the number of lung
metastases 5-fold (P < 0.05) compared with no treatment
(Control). Furthermore, the number of lung metastases in
the a-TAGS-DC vaccination group was signiﬁcantly lower

immune response. We show for the ﬁrst time that in addition to
its well-described induction of tumor cell apoptosis, a-TEA
induces autophagy in lung and mammary tumor cells and that
autophagy-mediated cell death is partially responsible for the
cytotoxic properties of a-TEA.
Autophagy is considered a prosurvival mechanism for recycling damaged organelles and proteins by cells undergoing
various forms of stress including nutrient deprivation. However, recent evidence suggests that under certain circumstances and depending on the stressor, extensive, and irreversible cellular damage can occur culminating in autophagic
cell death (32, 33). The contribution of autophagy to cell death
has been documented in studies in which inhibition of the
autophagy pathway genes, Atg5, Atg6, or Atg7 by RNAi resulted
in increased cell survival (34–36). Our ﬁnding that shRNA
knockdown of Atg12 increased the clonogenicity of a-TEA–
treated tumor cells is supportive of the role of autophagy in
a-TEA–mediated tumor cell death.
Recently, it has become increasingly clear that autophagy
and apoptosis are not independently regulated and that crosstalk may exist between both pathways (14, 15, 37). The simultaneous induction of autophagy and apoptosis by a-TEA in
our study has also been reported for other anticancer drugs
including paclitaxel (38), mitoxantrone (39), oxaliplatin (39),

3542

melphalan (38), arsenic trioxide (40), imatinib (41), and the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (42). In our study, we found that
autophagy preceded apoptosis during a-TEA treatment as has
been previously reported for other stress triggers including
growth factor starvation and apoptosis-inducing agents
(27, 43). However, unlike previous reports, which showed
autophagy inhibition in association with progressive apoptosis
(27, 43), we showed that a-TEA–induced autophagy remained
high over time. The ﬁnding in our study that blockade of
apoptosis using the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk further
increased the formation of LC3-II punctates in a-TEA–treated
tumor cells, suggested cross-talk between both pathways
during a-TEA–mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity. Interestingly,
in our study, a-TEA treatment resulted in only a very modest
decrease in Beclin-1 protein without detectable Beclin-1 cleavage products (data not shown). In the studies by Wirawan and
colleagues (27) and Zhu and colleagues (43) where progressive
apoptosis correlated with autophagy inhibition, caspasedependent cleavage of Beclin-1 was observed. The discrepancy
between their ﬁndings and ours could be due, in part, to
differences in the cell lines and stress triggers used in the
studies. Our results suggest that autophagy and apoptosis
induction by a-TEA occur in parallel and that Beclin-1 is
likely not involved in regulation of cross-talk between both
pathways.
We also show here for the ﬁrst time that the autophagosome-enriched fraction (a-TAGS), generated by treating tumor
cells in vitro with a-TEA, was an efﬁcient tumor antigen carrier.
DC pulsed with a-TAGS derived from OVA-expressing tumor
cells stimulated antigen cross-presentation evidenced by
enhanced proliferation of OVA-speciﬁc OT-I CD8þ T cells. This
CD8þ T-cell activation could be partially blocked with 3-MA,
suggesting that autophagy is essential for efﬁcient antigen
cross-presentation. Cross-presentation of an endogenous
tumor-associated antigen (GP70) was also induced by a-TAGS
and was inhibited by shRNA knockdown of Atg12, a gene
product essential for autophagy. Thus, we show in our study
by both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of autophagy
that a-TEA–induced autophagy is necessary for a-TAGS–
mediated stimulation of cross-presentation. The improved
antigen cross-presentation by a-TAGS–pulsed DC (a-TAGSDC) observed in vitro was also evident in vivo as intranodally
injected a-TAGS derived from 3LL-OVA and 4T1-OVA tumor
cells induced proliferation of adoptively transferred OT-I CD8þ
T cells, suggesting that a-TAGS–associated tumor antigens are
cross-presented in vivo. More importantly, a-TAGS-DC vaccination was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than tumor lysate–
pulsed DC (Lysate-DC) at reducing the incidence of experimental lung metastasis in the 3LL tumor model. a-TAGS-DC
vaccination was less effective at suppressing established 4T1
tumors and its ability to prolong animal survival was comparable to that of Lysate-DC that have long been recognized
to induce tumor-speciﬁc antitumor immune responses (44).
Taken together, these results suggest that tumor antigens
in a-TAGS were cross-presented in vivo to stimulate an antitumor immune response. These results are also in agreement
with our earlier report (2) showing that a-TEA treatment
of tumor-bearing mice enhanced the antitumor immune

response and resulted in increased cytokine secretion and
tumor speciﬁc cytotoxicity and that the antitumor efﬁcacy
of a-TEA treatment was partially dependent on a functional
T-cell response (2).
It has recently been reported that cytoreductive chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine (45) and doxorubicin
(46) can have immune-stimulatory effects and the emerging
consensus is that these effects depend on the speciﬁc
cytotoxic mechanisms of a given drug (47). Here we provide
evidence for the ﬁrst time that a-TEA induces tumor cell
autophagy and that the autophagosome-enriched fraction
stimulated tumor-speciﬁc cross-presentation that was
dependent on a functional autophagy pathway. Because of
its ability to stimulate autophagy and enhance cross-priming
of CD8þ T cells, a-TEA chemotherapy may have clinical
relevance as a new strategy for generating tumor-associated
antigens for cross-presentation by endogenous DC. Combining a-TEA therapy with immune modulators such as
anti-CTLA-4, anti-OX40, or anti-4-1BB, which promote Tcell expansion, effector function, and survival could be an
effective strategy for enhancing the antitumor response.

www.aacrjournals.org

Some of these agents either have already gained Food and
Drug Administration approval (anti-CTLA-4; ref. 48) or are in
various stages of clinical testing [anti-OX40 (ref. 49;
NCT01416844), anti-4-1BB (ref. 50; NCT01471210), anti-programmed death ligand-1 (NCT00729664), anti-programmed
death-1 (NCT00730639)] and could potentially be more
effective when combined with a-TEA. Plans are underway
at our institute to test the safety and tolerability of a-TEA in
a ﬁrst-in-human phase I trial in patients with advanced
cancer.
