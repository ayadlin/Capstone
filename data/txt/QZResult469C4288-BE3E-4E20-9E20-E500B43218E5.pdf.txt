Abstract
Transforming growth factor B (TGF-B) signaling via Smad
proteins occurs in various cell types. However, whereas the
biological response to TGF-B can be as distinct as growth
promoting (i.e., mesenchymal cells) versus growth inhibiting
(i.e., epithelial cells), few discernible differences in TGF-B
signaling have been reported. In the current study, we
examined the role of Ras in the proliferative response to
TGF-B and how it might interface with Smad-dependent and
Smad-independent TGF-B signaling targets. TGF-B stimulated
Ras activity in a subset of mesenchymal, but not epithelial,
cultures and was required for extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)–dependent transcriptional responses. Although
dominant negative Ras had no effect on TGF-B internalization
or Smad-dependent signaling (i.e., phosphorylation, nuclear
translocation, or SBE-luciferase activity), it did prevent the
hyperphosphorylation of the Smad transcriptional corepressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF). This was not sufficient,
however, to overcome the mitogenic response stimulated by
TGF-B, which was dependent on signals downstream of p21activated kinase 2 (PAK2). Moreover, although the initial
activation of Ras and PAK2 are distinctly regulated, TGF-B–
stimulated PAK2 activity is required for Ras-dependent ERK
phosphorylation and Elk-1 transcription. These findings show
the requirement for crosstalk between two Smad-independent
pathways in regulating TGF-B proliferation and indicate that
the mechanism(s) by which TGF-B stimulates growth is not
simply the opposite of its growth inhibitory actions. [Cancer

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is the prototypic member
of a superfamily of secreted proteins that regulate a wide range of
cellular responses in a milieu- and cell type–dependent manner
(1, 2). The vast majority of mammalian cells expresses the plasma
membrane TGF-h binding proteins referred to as the type I (ThRI),
type II (ThRII), and type III (ThRIII or h-glycan) receptors.
Although the role of the type III receptor is not well understood,
ThRI and ThRII are well characterized transmembrane proteins

that possess serine/threonine kinase activity and mediate TGF-h–
generated signaling. Ligand binding to the constitutively active
ThRII results in the formation of a heterotetrameric receptor
complex on the cell surface and activation of ThRI through which
the TGF-h signal is propagated (3).
The best characterized means of TGF-h signaling occurs through
a family of cytoplasmic transducers referred to as Smad proteins
(4, 5). There are three general subgroups of Smads, the receptorassociated Smads (R-Smads; Smad2 and Smad3 for TGF-h
signaling), a co-Smad (Smad4), and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads;
Smad6 and Smad7). The R-Smads bind transiently to the receptor
complex and are direct targets of the activated ThRI kinase. This
COOH-terminal phosphorylation leads to R-Smad activation,
association with Smad4, and nuclear translocation where they
assemble with DNA-binding elements to modulate gene transcription. The fact that a single ligand (TGF-h) is capable of generating
such divergent cellular responses is indicative of complex protein
interactions at multiple levels in the signal transduction cascade.
For instance, the differential combination of receptors that form
the tetrameric receptor complex results in the activation of distinct
R-Smad proteins, whereas the association of Smads with selective
DNA-binding proteins modulates specific gene responses (4, 5).
In addition to the Smad cascade, TGF-h activates a number of
other signaling pathways (6, 7). Recently, we characterized the
Smad-independent activation of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2), the
c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K) by TGF-h in mesenchymal, but not in epithelial cultures
(8–11). Specifically, TGF-h–activated PI3K/PAK2/c-Abl was required for the induction of morphologic transformation, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts in a
Smad-independent manner. Identification of these cell type–
specific pathways extends earlier studies documenting differential
binding of TGF-h to its receptors (12, 13) and the induction of
distinct transcription factors of the Jun/activator protein 1 family
in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, leading to distinct, even opposite,
transcriptional outcomes (13, 14). Other Smad-independent
signaling molecules include (but are not limited to) TGF-h–
activated kinase-1/p38, c-jun-NH2-kinase, Rho family proteins (Rac,
cdc42, and RhoA), and Ras (15–19).
Ras is of particular interest due to its connection to PI3K and
its well-established role in cell proliferation and transformation
(20, 21). Ras is a small GTP binding protein in which activity is
dictated by the ratio of GTP-bound (active) to GDP-bound
(inactive) states. Ras-GDP is exchanged for GTP by the intervention
of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), enabling it to
interact with downstream effectors; conversely, GTPase-activating
proteins return it to the inactive status. Once activated, the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a common
downstream route mediating Ras signaling. In general, activated

Ras promotes association of Raf with the plasma membrane where
other events facilitate Raf activation (22). This results in the
phosphorylation/activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/
ERK kinases (MEK) 1 and 2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of
ERK1 and ERK2 (23, 24). Once activated, ERKs phosphorylate a
number of cytoplasmic proteins as well as translocate to the
nucleus where they control the activity of various transcription
factors and other nuclear proteins such as Elk-1, SAP1, and RNA
polymerase II (24).
Although Ras has been known to be modulated by TGF-h
ligands since the early 1990s (25), the role which the Ras/ERK
pathway plays in TGF-h signaling is unclear (6, 18). It has been
shown that Ras opposes the effect of Smad-dependent TGF-h
signaling by (a) stimulating ERK phosphorylation of the Smad
linker region, resulting in a block to nuclear translocation; (b)
inducing degradation of Smad4; or (c) regulating the expression of
the Smad transcriptional corepressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF)
(26–28). Alternatively, Ras has been reported to promote TGF-h
signaling (29–31). It is currently unknown how such distinct
responses can be integrated within the context of TGF-h action. In
that regard, because Ras signaling is primarily associated with
providing a growth advantage, a possible explanation may be that
the majority of studies used epithelial cell models where TGF-h
normally functions as a growth inhibitor. Given that TGF-h is one
of the most profibrotic cytokines known (8), the relevant target for
TGF-h–stimulated Ras might be the tumor stroma.
To that end, because tumor development and progression are
dependent on the synergistic interplay of cancer cells and an
activated stroma (32, 33), in the present manuscript, we have
investigated the role of the Ras/ERK pathway with other Smaddependent and Smad-independent signaling effectors in cells of
fibroblastic lineage. The results indicate that (a) TGF-h stimulates
Ras and ERK activation in a subset of fibroblast, but not epithelial,
cell lines; (b) Ras activity is not required for Smad2 or Smad3
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, or SBE-luciferase activity;
(c) inhibition of the Smad transcriptional corepressor TGIF by
dominant negative Ras is not sufficient to overcome TGF-h–
stimulated proliferation; and (d) whereas PAK2 and Ras signaling
are independently initiated, there is crosstalk between these two
Smad-independent pathways such that PAK2 is required for Rasdependent ERK phosphorylation and transcriptional responses via
regulating Raf activity. Together, these findings not only document
the complexity of the intracellular crosstalk required for regulated
TGF-h signaling, but emphasize the need to more critically
integrate the action of cytokines on stromal elements when
investigating tumor development and/or progression.

anti-goat antibody were from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA).
The rabbit anti–phospho-Smad3 antibody to the peptide COOHGSPSIRCSpSVpS was generated in our laboratory (10).
Western blot analysis. Cultures were treated overnight in serum-free
DMEM before stimulation. Lysates were prepared [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 complete protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Science]
and equivalent protein (f100 Ag determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay
kit; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) probed with the indicated phospho
or total antibody. Secondary goat anti-mouse (1:2,000 dilution) or donkey
anti-rabbit (1:2,000 dilution) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Amersham (Piscataway, NJ), respectively. As the adenoviralexpressed dominant negative Ras was not always observed as either an
increase in total Ras protein or a slightly higher migrating protein (Fig. 2B),
transduced His-RasN17 or eGFP protein was detected using anti-His or antiGFP (Figs. 2B, 3A, 4B, 5A, and 6A).
Kinase assays. For PAK2 and Raf kinase assays, cells were grown to
confluence in 10% DMEM and serum starved overnight (10). Cultures were
treated as indicated and lysed for 30 min at 4jC in 750 AL of kinase lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L NaF, 0.1 TIU/mL aprotinin, 50 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 Amol/L sodium vanadate, and 1 Ag/mL
leupeptin]. Extracts were clarified, and equivalent protein (500–700 Ag)
was incubated overnight at 4jC with antibody. Immune complexes were
collected with protein A-sepharose (Sigma) and washed twice in kinase lysis
buffer and twice in kinase buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT] before incubation in 50 AL kinase buffer containing
5 Amol/L ATP, 5 Ag myelin basic protein (Sigma), and 5 ACi/AL [g32P]ATP or
5 Amol/L ATP, 5 Ag MEK1-GST (Chemicon International), and 1 ACi/AL
[g32P]ATP for PAK2 and Raf kinase assays, respectively. The kinase reaction
was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37jC, stopped with 50 AL 2 Laemmli
buffer, and following SDS-PAGE visualized by autoradiography.
Adenoviruses. His tagged-dominant negative Ras adenovirus (Ad-HisRasN17) was constructed as follows: the insert SpeI-6 His-N17-NheI was
synthesized by PCR using pCMV-RasN17 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA) as the template and the primer pair SpeI-His-Ras5¶ and NheI-Raswt3¶. The PCR product was cloned into the shuttle vector pSV8, digested
with BstBI, and transfected into 293Cre cells. The generated Ad-His-RasN17
was plaque purified, and cesium chloride gradient–purified virus was used
for the experiments. Construction of enhanced GFP (Ad-eGFP) and
dominant negative PAK2 (Ad-PAK2K278R) expressing adenoviruses was
previously described (10).
Ras activation. Cultures were grown to f90% confluency in 100-mm
dishes when the media was changed to serum-free DMEM. Following
24 h incubation, the cells were treated with TGF-h2 (10 ng/mL) for the
indicated times. Control and treated groups were washed twice in cold PBS
and 0.5 mL of lysis buffer (EZ-Detect Ras Activation kit; Pierce)
supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science).
The lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min and spun at 16,060  g (4jC for
15 min). An aliquot was used for Western blot analysis to determine total
Ras (8–10), and f500 Ag of total protein per sample was processed for
determining GTP-loaded Ras as per kit instructions.
Luciferase assays. Cells were plated in six-well plates at 2  105 per well.
The next day, media were changed to OPTI-MEM, and cells were transfected
with 0.5 Ag of CMV–h-galactosidase and SBE-Luc (2.5 Ag) or a mix of Gal4Elk-1-307-428 (0.5 Ag) + Gal4-tk80-Luc (2.0 Ag) using Gene Juice (Novagen/
EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). After 4 h, media were changed to
DMEM–5% FBS, and the cells were allowed to recover overnight. When

adenovirus was employed, cultures were transduced with the corresponding
viral vectors in OPTI-MEM for 4 h and then placed in serum-free DMEM for
20 h. On day 3, TGF-h2 (10 ng/mL) was added in the absence or presence of
the indicated drug or vehicle. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after
TGF-h2 or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) treatment (8).
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test was done, with a P value <0.05
considered significant.

Results
TGF-B stimulates Ras pathway signaling in fibroblasts but
not epithelial cells. The role(s) of activated Ras in TGF-h signaling
is unclear. Because actions of TGF-h are known to be dependent
on cell context, we wished to determine, first, if Ras activity is
modulated by TGF-h and, second, if this might occur in a cell type–
specific manner. To address both questions, we stimulated three
representative fibroblast (AKR-2B, BALB/c, NIH-3T3) and epithelial
(HeLa, Mv1Lu, MDCK) cells with TGF-h and determined whether
there was any effect on Ras activation with an assay whereby the
Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 specifically pulls down the
GTP-bound form of Ras. Because preliminary experiments indicated Ras activation beginning after 2 to 5 min of TGF-h treatment
(data not shown), to ensure greater reproducibility, Ras activity was
routinely determined following 10 min TGF-h addition (Fig. 1A).
Although activated Ras was stimulated f2-fold in the three
mesenchymal lines, there was no significant effect of TGF-h on Ras
activation in any of the epithelial cultures from 1 to 240 min TGF-h
stimulation (Fig. 1A and data not shown).
Once activated, Ras couples to a number of downstream targets
of which the MAPK pathway is one of the most extensively studied,
leading to gene activation (24). As such, we next determined
whether the cell type–specific activation of Ras was similarly
observed for both ERK phosphorylation and ERK-dependent Elk-1
luciferase expression. ERK phosphorylation became detectable
between 20 and 40 min TGF-h treatment and remained elevated
for at least 120 min in mesenchymal AKR-2B cells. However, when a
similar kinetic study was done in Mv1Lu epithelial cultures, there
was no significant effect of TGF-h on the basal levels of ERK1 or
ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Quantitation of this differential
cell type response in TGF-h–stimulated ERK activity is shown in
Fig. 1B (top). Furthermore, TGF-h increased expression of the
ERK-dependent Elk-1 luciferase reporter f3-fold in AKR-2B cells,
whereas there was no difference between the untreated and treated
Mv1Lu groups (Fig. 1C). Similar responses were observed in the
other mesenchymal and epithelial lines (data not shown).
Although the preceding data document Ras/ERK/Elk-1 activation following TGF-h treatment of mesenchymal cells, the
dependence of downstream targets such as ERK and Elk-1 on
Ras had not, as yet, been determined. As such, to investigate the
role of Ras in this TGF-h–regulated pathway, we constructed an
adenovirus encoding a His-tagged dominant negative Ras (AdHis-RasN17; ref. 34). Following the documentation of AKR-2B
infectivity (Fig. 2A) and inhibition of TGF-h–stimulated Ras
activity (Fig. 2B, top), cells were transduced with Ad-His-RasN17 or
control Ad-eGFP, and ERK phosphorylation and Elk-1 transcriptional activity were determined. Ad.RasN17 decreased both
the level of p-ERK (Fig. 2B, bottom and Fig. 2C, left) and Elk-1–
luciferase (Fig. 2C, right) in direct relation with increasing doses
of the adenovirus, reducing the TGF-h–induced p-ERK and
luciferase levels to 25% to 30% of TGF-h–stimulated control cells.
Although high doses of control adenovirus (Ad-eGFP) had some
nonspecific effects in the Elk-1 transcriptional assay (Fig. 2C,

www.aacrjournals.org

right), these effects were minimal for ERK phosphorylation.
Because the Elk-1 transcription factor is phosphorylated by
MAPKs (such as ERK) to stimulate transcription (24, 35), the data
indicate that Ras-dependent gene activation is similarly induced
as ERK phosphorylation by TGF-h in a subset of mesenchymal
(but not epithelial) cell lines (Figs. 1 and 2).
The Smad pathway is crucial to many aspects of the biological
actions of TGF-h. As such, we next investigated the relation (if any)
between Ras/ERK and Smad signaling as studies have shown both
antagonistic as well as cooperative interactions (6). Initial experiments addressed the general question whether Ras activity is
required for Smad2 and Smad3 signaling. Accordingly, AKR-2B cells
were infected with adenovirus expressing eGFP or dominant
negative Ras and the level of R-Smad phosphorylation and ligand
internalization assessed following addition of TGF-h (Fig. 3A and
data not shown). Because Smad activation was unchanged by
dominant negative Ras (Fig. 3A), the observed similar lack of an
effect on TGF-h internalization (data not shown) by Ad.His.RasN17
was anticipated because Smad phosphorylation is dependent on
TGF-h endocytic activity in the cell models used (36, 37). However,
as recent publications have indicated that Smad nuclear translocation and/or effects on gene expression can be dissociated from
Smad phosphorylation (38), we also examined whether Ras
signaling would be necessary for either response. As shown in
Fig. 3B and C, Ad.RasN17 had no discernible effect on Smad3
nuclear translocation or SBE luciferase activity induced by TGF-h.
Although the preceding data show that Ras-dependent signaling
is not required for R-Smad phosphorylation, nuclear translocation,
or gene activation, it does not address the converse (i.e., whether
Ras-dependent signaling requires Smad activity). Consequently,
expression of the Ras/ERK-regulated Elk-1 reporter was examined
in control AKR-2B cells and a MEF line from a Smad3 knock-out
mouse transfected with dominant negative Smad2. Although
TGF-h was unable to activate the Smad3 responsive SBE promoter
in the Smad knock-out cells, Elk-1 luciferase activity was similarly
induced by TGF-h as was observed with the known Elk-1 activator
PDGF (ref. 39; Fig. 3D). The previous data (Figs. 1–3) show that
TGF-h stimulation of Ras activity (a) is differentially regulated in
fibroblast and epithelial cell types; (b) results in ERK-dependent
gene activation; and (c) is mediated independent of Smad2 and
Smad3.
Inhibition of TGIF is not sufficient to prevent TGF-B
proliferation. The mechanisms controlling TGF-h growth inhibition have been extensively investigated (1, 4, 5). Although a number
of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear pathways have been implicated, a
common theme associated with the growth inhibitory response is
the ability of the Smads to recruit DNA binding transcription
factors as well as coactivators or corepressors to the transcriptional
complex. Because we have been focusing on processes regulating
the proliferative side of TGF-h action most relevant to the tumor
stroma, an unanswered question is whether TGF-h growth
promotion is mediated via a reciprocal action on those intermediaries required for growth arrest. One such target proposed to
antagonize TGF-h growth inhibition through ERK-dependent
phosphorylation/stabilization, preventing cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor gene expression, is the Smad corepressor TGIF (27). As
would be expected for a negative regulator of TGF-h growth
inhibition, the addition of TGF-h to Mv1Lu cells (growth inhibited
by TGF-h) had no discernible effect on TGIF phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A, left). However, consistent with a model whereby TGF-h–
mediated growth arrest and cell proliferation are regulated through

inverse effects on similar targets, TGF-h treatment of AKR-2B cells
(growth stimulated by TGF-h) resulted in a significant increase in
phosphorylated/stabilized TGIF (Fig. 4A, right).
TGIF phosphorylation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) has
been shown to be controlled by Ras/ERK signaling (27). In
agreement with that finding, addition of the MEK inhibitor
PD098059 or dominant negative Ras abrogated the effect of
TGF-h on TGIF phosphorylation in AKR-2B cells (Fig. 4A and B).
However, whereas inhibiting PI3K or its downstream target PAK2
abolished the stimulatory effect of TGF-h on AKR-2B growth
(Fig. 4C; refs. 9, 10), contrary to our expectations, inhibition of Ras
activity had no effect on TGF-h–stimulated proliferation (Fig. 4C).
Thus, whereas stabilization of the Smad transcriptional corepressor
TGIF may be critical for overcoming TGF-h growth inhibition by
diminishing p15Ink4B expression, it is not sufficient to account for
the growth-promoting effects of TGF-h in fibroblasts.

defining the proliferative signals and determining the nodes of
intersection between the various pathways are critical to
understanding this aspect of TGF-h biology. To that end, we have
recently shown that PI3K and PAK2 are spatially dependent targets
activated within 15 min TGF-h treatment of mesenchymal cells
that have a crucial role in the induction of morphologic
transformation, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth
(Fig. 4C and refs. 9, 10). As PI3K is a known Ras effector, we
examined whether TGF-h activation of Ras/ERK signaling was
upstream, dependent on, and/or coupled to PI3K/PAK2 activity. To
determine if Ras activity was required for PI3K-dependent
signaling, AKR-2B cells were transduced with Ad-eGFP or Ad-HisRasN17 and assessed for Akt phosphorylation and PAK2 kinase
activity following TGF-h addition (Fig. 5A, right and middle).
Despite reducing TGF-h–stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation to basal levels (Fig. 5A, left), dominant negative Ras had no
detectable effect on either Akt or PAK2 activation by TGF-h,
indicating that Ras is not directly upstream.

PI3K has also been reported to be a Ras activator (20, 40); as
such, the requirement for PI3K/PAK2 activity on Ras signaling was
also examined. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 or
infection with a dominant negative PAK2 adenovirus abolished
TGF-h–stimulated ERK phosphorylation and Ras-dependent Elk-1
transcriptional activity (Fig. 5B and C). This requirement for PI3K
and PAK2 activity in the TGF-h stimulation of Ras signaling could
indicate a role for these proteins in regulating Ras activation, per
se, and/or within the downstream kinase cascade leading to ERK
phosphorylation. That this control is not occurring at the level
of Ras activation is shown in Fig. 5D. Cells were treated with
the indicated reagents, and the increase in GTP-loaded Ras was
determined. Although TGF-h stimulated an approximately 3- to
3.5-fold increase in Ras activity, and Ad.RasN17 reduced this to
basal, inhibiting PI3K or PAK2 with LY294002 or dominant negative
Ad.PAK2K278R , respectively, had no significant effect.

The most proximal target downstream of Ras required for ERK
phosphorylation is Raf. Raf activation is complex and depends on
diverse interactions with various accessory and regulatory proteins
(22). Moreover, group I PAKs have been shown to have a role in Raf
activation by phosphorylating Ser338 (41–43). To determine
whether PAK2 was fulfilling a similar requirement in TGF-h
signaling via Ras, the studies reported in Fig. 6A were done. As
expected, TGF-h stimulated both Raf Ser338 phosphorylation and
kinase activity, and this was unaffected by the downstream MEK
inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5
and 6). In addition, consistent with the data presented in Fig. 5B
and C, inhibition of either PI3K or PAK2 activity abolished both
responses to a similar extent as dominant negative Ad.RasN17
(Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 4, 10, and 12). Based on
these observations, we propose a model whereby Ras signaling is

and PI3K pathways (Fig. 6B and refs. 9, 10). Although no condition
for integrating with Smad signaling has currently been identified,
PI3K-dependent PAK2 activity is coupled to the Ras cascade
because it is necessary for TGF-h activation of Raf and subsequent
ERK-dependent transcriptional responses. Although it is currently
unknown whether there are additional nodes of intersection, what
is clear, however, is the need for crosstalk between a number of
signaling pathways to mediate the diverse biological response
generated by TGF-h.

Discussion
Identification and characterization of the Smad proteins have
been critical to understanding a large extent of TGF-h action.
However, when one considers the diversity of phenotypes

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

controlled by TGF-h, it would seem reasonable that additional
Smad-independent pathways are also operative. Although it is
difficult to completely separate Smad-dependent from Smadindependent signaling (7), a number of responses have been
reported to occur independent of primary Smad regulation (7, 9).
One such pathway that has received a significant amount of
attention is MAPK signaling following Ras activation (6, 18).
TGF-h has been reported to stimulate, inhibit, and/or have no
effect on the Ras/ERK pathway (6, 31, 44, 45). A possible
explanation to account for such divergent findings is that a variety
of cell types or differentiation models have been employed. One
means by which that issue might be more clearly addressed is to
identify/characterize TGF-h pathways that function in a cell type–
specific manner. For instance, we have determined that PI3K
represents a branch point in the mesenchymal cell response to

TGF-h (9). Following the addition of TGF-h to a subset of fibroblast
(but not epithelial) cultures, PI3K activity is required for
independent activation of PAK2 and Akt (9, 10). Although the
targets downstream of Akt are currently under investigation, PAK2
is downstream of PI3K, upstream of the c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase, and essential for TGF-h–stimulated proliferation and
morphologic transformation (8, 9, 11). Because Ras and PI3K
signaling have been coupled in a number of models, we wished to
address the general question whether Ras would show a similar
cell tropism and association with PI3K in TGF-h signaling. To that
end, initial studies directly examined TGF-h–stimulated Ras GTP
loading in both mesenchymal and epithelial cell lines (Fig. 1A).

Similar to what we had observed for PI3K, each of the
mesenchymal cultures (but not epithelial) showed Ras activation
within minutes of TGF-h addition. These kinetics are consistent
with that observed for other Ras activators (46) and support a
direct interaction of the TGF-h receptor complex on Ras. Although
it is currently unknown how TGF-h receptor/Ras coupling occurs,
it was further shown that this interaction leads to the activation of
the MAPK cascade and subsequent stimulation of an ERKdependent luciferase reporter independent of Smad2 or Smad3
(Figs. 1–3). Although we did not observe Ras or ERK activation by
TGF-h in a number of epithelial cultures (Fig. 1 and data not
shown), this finding should not be extended beyond the cell types

studied. Similarly, the biological phenotype being assessed needs
to also be considered as ERK responses in the context of a TGF-h–
driven EMT may be reflecting the ‘‘mesenchymal transition’’ in
contrast to an inherent property of epithelia (29, 31, 45).
The relation between TGF-h activation of the Smad pathway and
Ras/ERK signaling is complex. Although it is clear that the linker
region of R-Smads can be phosphorylated by ERK, the functional
consequence of that phosphorylation is not straightforward. For
instance, linker phosphorylation has been shown to prevent (26) as
well as enhance Smad nuclear translocation (30, 47). Although we
did not directly investigate the relation between Smad linker region
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, in the mesenchymal
cell models used where Ras and Smad signaling are both activated,
these responses seem to be independently regulated (Fig. 3).
However, whereas the results suggest that Ras has no direct effect
on the Smad pathway, this should not be extended beyond the cells
and biological end points studied.
The majority of studies investigating TGF-h action have focused
on the growth inhibitory actions of TGF-h in epithelial cultures
(4, 5). Because Ras activity is primarily associated with cell
proliferation, it was of interest to investigate whether there was a
reciprocal relation between the mechanisms associated with

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

TGF-h growth inhibition and growth stimulation. One such target
reported to modulate the sensitivity of cells to TGF-h growth
inhibition is the Smad transcriptional corepressor TGIF (27).
Stabilization of TGIF by Ras/ERK phosphorylation in response to
EGF has been shown to favor the formation of a Smad2-TGIF
corepressor complex (resulting in diminished TGF-h growth
inhibition), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tiul1 can associate with
TGIF to target Smad2 for degradation (27, 48). As we were
investigating cytokine activity in a cell context where TGF-h both
stimulated cell proliferation and induced Ras/ERK signaling, we
addressed two general questions: first, would TGF-h (similar to
EGF) promote TGIF phosphorylation/stabilization under conditions where it is growth promoting; and second, if TGF-h signaling
induced TGIF phosphorylation, would preventing that response be
associated with inhibiting TGF-h proliferation? Although TGF-h
treatment resulted in Ras-dependent TGIF phosphorylation and
p15Ink4b luciferase expression (Fig. 4A and B and data not shown),
preventing TGIF phosphorylation by dominant negative Ras (i.e.,
avoiding the loss of growth-repressive targets such as p15Ink4B)
was not sufficient to overcome TGF-h–stimulated proliferation
(Fig. 4B and C). Although the lack of association between TGIF
phosphorylation and TGF-h proliferation was unexpected given

TGF-b Activation of H-Ras in Mesenchymal Cells

previous data relating TGIF to TGF-h growth inhibition and
p15Ink4b mRNA up-regulation (27), it clearly indicates that cell
context–dependent responses of TGF-h are regulated in a variety of
distinct as well as overlapping levels.
Over the past few years, we have been developing a model of
TGF-h signaling that distinguishes the growth-promoting from the
growth-inhibitory aspects of TGF-h action (8–10). A central
component of this model is PI3K (Fig. 6B and ref. 9). Addition of
TGF-h to mesenchymal cultures results in PI3K-dependent
phosphoinositide production and the generation (to the best of
our understanding) of two independent branches leading to either
Akt phosphorylation or PAK2 and c-Abl activation (9, 11). Because
TGF-h–stimulated Ras/ERK activation displayed a similar cell
tropism and Smad independence as PI3K, we next investigated
whether it represented a unique signaling target and/or was
integrated within the PI3K pathway(s). Although the inhibition of
Ras had no effect on PAK2 activity or Akt phosphorylation

(Fig. 5A), preventing PI3K or PAK2 signaling with LY294002 or
dominant negative PAK2, respectively, abrogated TGF-h induced
ERK phosphorylation and Elk-1 luciferase activity (Fig. 5B and C).
However, inhibiting Akt responses with Akt inhibitor II (SH-5), IV,
or V had no discernible effect on ERK phosphorylation (data not
shown). Because Ras activation is independent of PI3K or PAK2
(Fig. 5D), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis (a) that
Ras and PI3K represent distinct arms downstream of the TGF-h
receptor; and (b) of crosstalk between Ras and PI3K signaling at the
level of PAK2 for propagating the TGF-h signal(s). Further evidence
in support of that proposal was the demonstration that infection
with dominant negative PAK2 prevents Raf activation following
TGF-h treatment (Fig. 6A). Because a similar requirement for
group I PAKs in PI3K-dependent Raf phosphorylation has been
reported previously (41, 43, 49), the results suggest that PAK
proteins represent a common intermediary that integrates Ras and
PI3K signaling downstream of numerous effectors.

between TGF-h–stimulated PI3K and
Ras pathways. A, AKR-2B cells were left

ligand binding to the TGF-h receptor

Smad2/3 activation occurs in both cell
types and is dependent on receptor
endocytic activity, PI3K and Ras pathways
represent cell type–specific TGF-h
signaling responses initiated upstream of
dynamin action (9, 37). PI3K functions as a
branch point in TGF-h signal propagation
leading to independent activation of Akt
or PAK2 (9). Although PAK2 is necessary
for continued PI3K signaling via c-Abl (11)
as well as interfacing with Ras-dependent
signaling at the level of c-Raf activation,
the signals downstream of Akt are
currently unknown. Arrows, not

It was unexpected that inhibition of Ras/ERK signaling with
dominant negative Ras did not prevent TGF-h–stimulated cell
proliferation (Fig. 4C). Because this response is dependent on signals
downstream of PI3K (8–10), it is clear that a direct linear relation
between Ras and PI3K is not operative. However (as discussed
above), although independently initiated, these pathways intersect
in the PAK2 requirement for activation of Raf and subsequent ERK
signaling. A model depicting these findings is presented in Fig. 6B.
Although it is unknown whether there are additional junctures
between PI3K and Ras or Smad signaling, the absence of detectable
effects of Ras on TGF-h–stimulated proliferation provides further
evidence that distinct signaling programs control normal and
deregulated growth. Moreover, because an activated stroma plays a
