BMX Negatively Regulates BAK Function, Thereby
Increasing Apoptotic Resistance to
Chemotherapeutic Drugs
Joanna L. Fox and Alan Storey

Abstract
The ability of chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis,
predominantly via the mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptotic pathway, is thought to be a major determinant of the sensitivity of a
given cancer to treatment. Intrinsic apoptosis, regulated by the
BCL2 family, integrates diverse apoptotic signals to determine cell
death commitment and then activates the nodal effector protein
BAK to initiate the apoptotic cascade. In this study, we identiﬁed
the tyrosine kinase BMX as a direct negative regulator of BAK
function. BMX associates with BAK in viable cells and is the ﬁrst
kinase to phosphorylate the key tyrosine residue needed to
maintain BAK in an inactive conformation. Importantly, elevated
BMX expression prevents BAK activation in tumor cells treated

with chemotherapeutic agents and is associated with increased
resistance to apoptosis and decreased patient survival. Accordingly, BMX expression was elevated in prostate, breast, and colon
cancers compared with normal tissue, including in aggressive
triple-negative breast cancers where BMX overexpression may be
a novel biomarker. Furthermore, BMX silencing potentiated BAK
activation, rendering tumor cells hypersensitive to otherwise
sublethal doses of clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents.
Our ﬁnding that BMX directly inhibits a core component of the
intrinsic apoptosis machinery opens opportunities to improve the
efﬁcacy of existing chemotherapy by potentiating BAK-driven cell
death in cancer cells. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1345–55. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

agents are transduced through redundant signaling networks
that ultimately converge on the mitochondrion to trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; refs. 6,
7–9). Mitochondrial-driven apoptosis involving MOMP
depends on the activation of BCL2 effector proteins, BAK and
BAX (9–12). The predominance of death over survival signals
determines whether MOMP takes place, a process involving
oligomerization and pore formation by activated BAK/BAX that
releases apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria and assists
the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
a process that ultimately consigns a cell to death (13). BAK and
BAX therefore exert their effects at a nodal commitment point in
the apoptotic cascade. As yet, the signaling pathways that are
subverted in cancer cells, which can confer a proliferative
advantage by directly suppressing BAK activation, have not been
delineated. We recently reported that in undamaged tumor cells,
BAK is present almost exclusively in a heavily phosphorylated
form and, unlike BAX, requires dephosphorylation for activation (14–16). This discovery was potentially very signiﬁcant
because we hypothesized that elevated levels of a BAK-speciﬁc
kinase, which may occur in cancer cells, would restrict BAK
activation and limit cell killing in response to cytotoxic drugs.
Importantly, in this context, diverse apoptotic stimuli activate
BAK, hence suppression of the ﬁrst step required for the initiation of BAK activation would be predicted to suppress an
apoptotic response to a wide variety of stimuli. Recalibrating
the cellular apoptotic threshold by potentiating BAK-dependent
cell killing through inhibition of kinase activity would be highly
desirable, as this is likely to increase the efﬁcacy of existing
cytotoxic drugs or emerging targeted therapies.
There are many tumor types that are highly resistant to chemotherapy, such as triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), for
which the overall prognosis is poor (17, 18). When TNBC recur,

Resistance to apoptosis is one of the biggest barriers in developing effective cancer treatments. This is due, in part, to the fact
that evading apoptosis is fundamentally required to allow cancer
cells to survive, proliferate, and disseminate and has been identiﬁed as one of the hallmarks traits of cancer described by Weinburg and Hannahan (1, 2). Chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted at
different cellular components that are common to all cells, remain
a front-line treatments in cancer therapy and depend heavily on
the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway to elicit their
effects (3). However, the ability of cancer cells to block or subdue
the apoptotic machinery means that many chemotherapeutic
agents that are currently used in clinic become less effective. The
pleiotropic resistance often displayed by cancer cells of different
origin to chemotherapeutic agents that damage cells in disparate
ways, coupled with drug-related toxicities, poses major barriers to
effective treatment (4, 5).

DNA damage, mitotic inhibitors, or exposure to other cytotoxic

there is often little response to chemotherapy, and there are only a
few treatment options in this setting. Thus, there is an urgent
clinical need to identify new therapeutic targets to improve the
outlook for these patients. Recent genetic proﬁling of these
tumors reveals that there are diverse changes that occur during
their development that makes identifying therapeutically targetable proteins complex (19). We hypothesize then that if a BAK
kinase was overexpressed or upregulated in these tumor types, this
would effectively enable the cell to block initiation of BAKdependent apoptosis, thereby increasing the apoptotic threshold
of the tumor.

In this article, we identify BMX as the ﬁrst tyrosine kinase that
is able to modulate activation of BAK by direct phosphorylation
of a key tyrosine residue, Y108. We ﬁnd BMX expression to be
upregulated in numerous tumor types of major importance,
including TNBC, and that BMX overexpression in tumor cells
increased the apoptotic threshold of these cells. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that modulation of BMX expression levels by
RNAi can resensitize tumor cells to existing chemotherapeutic
agents by decreasing BAK phosphorylation, resulting in
increased BAK activation potential and enhanced levels of
apoptotic cell death.

Results
Identiﬁcation of BMX as a potent inhibitor of BAK function
A conformational change at the N-terminal of BAK can be used
to measure levels of BAK activation, but this can only occur if the
phosphate at residue Y108 of BAK is ﬁrst removed and BAK is
rendered "activation competent" (15, 16). We therefore wanted to
identify kinases able to phosphorylate BAK at Y108, thus maintaining BAK in the inactive conformation. siRNA screening of the
TEC tyrosine kinase family revealed that knockdown of BMX, but
not the other family members, was able to signiﬁcantly increase
levels of BAK activation in response to camptothecin treatment
(Fig. 1A). To determine whether BMX was acting directly on BAK
or via upstream signaling pathways, we tested whether BMX could
bind directly to BAK using coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot-

ting. The BMX–BAK complex could be immunoprecipitated using
either a BAK or BMX antibody (Fig. 1B), indicating that the two
proteins were found in a stable complex in healthy cells. The
speciﬁcity of these coimmunoprecipitations was conﬁrmed using
BAK-null and BMX-knockdown cells as controls (Supplementary
Fig. S1). In contrast, BAX was not found to coimmunoprecipitate
with BMX (Supplementary Fig. S2). To further examine the BMX–
BAK complex in cells, we used a PLISA (23), which enables
individual protein–protein complexes in cells to be studied.
PLISA conﬁrmed that in undamaged cells, BMX was in close
proximity to endogenous BAK (Fig. 1C) whereas treatment of
cells for 6 hours with camptothecin caused a detectable decrease
in the number of PLISA foci present in a signiﬁcant number of the
cells studied (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
Single-color controls conﬁrmed that both BAK and BMX levels
were unaltered following treatment, as both proteins could be
detected at similar levels in both treated and untreated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). These data suggest that BMX
associates with BAK in undamaged cells, but following an apoptotic stimulus, the BMX–BAK complex dissociates, which correlates with a decrease in pY108 BAK in cells following camptothecin treatment. The decrease in PLISA foci occurred before other
morphologic changes associated with apoptosis revealing that
dissociation of the BMX–BAK complex is an early step in the BAK
activation process, in line with the fast kinetics of BAK activation.
To assess whether BMX was able to phosphorylate BAK at residue
Y108 and was not just present in a complex with inactive BAK, we
performed an in vitro kinase assay. BMX protein was immunoprecipitated from HT1080 cells and incubated in the presence of
[g 33P]ATP was able to phosphorylate puriﬁed GST-tagged WT, but
not the Y108A mutant BAK recombinant protein (Fig. 1D).

immunoprecipitated with an antiserum that speciﬁcally recognizes BAK that is phosphorylated at Y108, WT but not Y108A
mutant BAK was pulled down (Fig. 1E). Together these assays
show that BMX was able to phosphorylate BAK at this key
regulatory residue. It is possible that there are other tyrosine
kinases that are able to phosphorylate BAK that have yet to be
identiﬁed, but we conclude that BMX is the ﬁrst BAK tyrosine kinase
identiﬁed to date.
BMX is upregulated in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer
BMX is a member of the TEC family of non–receptor tyrosine
kinases, which has been reported to have roles in modulating
multiple cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Interestingly and supporting a role in
pathogenesis elevated BMX levels in bladder cancer were
reported to be associated with poorer prognosis (24), and BMX
is important in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
(25). Increased BMX expression has also been observed in
neoplastic skin (26), renal cell carcinoma (27), and in prostate
cancer (22, 28). To extend and explore these ﬁndings in greater
depth, we performed IHC on tissue microarrays of cancer
biopsies to determine BMX levels in a range of human tumor
types. This analysis revealed that BMX levels were signiﬁcantly
elevated in prostate, breast and colon cancers when compared
to normal tissue (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S5). In
conjunction with the IHC data, Western blotting of cell extracts
from prostate cell lines revealed higher levels of BMX protein in
PC3 and DU145 lines than in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B). In a panel
of colon cancer cell lines, we found that BMX overexpression
was readily detectable in 5 of 20 cell lines investigated. BMX
responds to receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that can be
transduced through BRAF to MAP kinases, but we found no
correlation between BMX levels and V600E BRAF mutation
status (Fig. 2C). In a drive to identify individuals most at risk
of developing the disease, genome-wide analysis of mutations
and SNPs in breast cancers have revealed a complex tumor
landscape and identiﬁed many new cancer-associated genes
and loci; however, no activating or other mutations in BMX
were reported (29–32). So-called TNBC are characterized by a
lack of expression of 3 important receptors: estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 and display heterogeneity in mutation patterns. TNBC accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers at
diagnosis, but the aggressive nature of the tumors and poor
prognosis likely account for a disproportionate share in mortality rates (33). Importantly, we found that 6 of 6 TNBC lines
investigated had much higher levels of BMX than cell lines in
which at least one receptor was expressed and lacked any
detectable BMX (Fig. 2D). Thus, while the acquisition of multiple mutations that in combination can alter the activity of the
many diverse signaling pathways upstream of BMX activity, in
some tumors, overexpression of BMX may promote evasion of
apoptosis and help confer a survival advantage to cancer cells.
However, the mechanism by which BMX is able to achieve this
by modulating cellular apoptosis to promote cancer cell sur-

vival has not been identiﬁed to date. Importantly, our data
suggest that the antiapoptotic role of BMX is largely through its
regulation of BAK phosphorylation at Y108.
BMX requires PTPN21 for BAK phosphorylation
Activation of BMX requires both transphosphorylation and
autophosphorylation. Once these events have occurred, a substantial increase in kinase activity is observed (34). In addition,
non–receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 21 (PTPN21) has
been reported to bind to and regulate the activity of BMX (35),
indeed in HT1080 cells, BMX can be immunoprecipitated with
PTPN21 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Structure function studies of
PTPN21 performed using the phosphatase domain failed to
identify any substrate motifs (36), but the modulation of Src
and EGF signaling pathways suggests that the full-length protein may be active (37). Previous siRNA screening of the non–
receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family to identify phosphatases involved in BAK activation revealed that knockdown
of some phosphatases led to a modest increase in BAK activation (16). However, further investigations indicated that knockdown of PTPN21 both by siRNA and shRNA (knockdown
determined by qRT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S7) also increased
the basal levels of BAK in a conformationally active state even
in the absence of any damage signal, presumably due to an
increase in the number of underphosphorylated BAK molecules. However, a dramatic potentiation of BAK activation
occurred when an apoptotic signal was induced using a chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agent such as camptothecin
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S8B) or UV radiation (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Concomitant with the increase in levels
of active BAK, we also found an increase in the number of cells
showing cytochrome c release early after camptothecin treatment (Fig. 3B) and actively undergoing apoptosis as judged by
Annexin V–positive staining (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig.
S9) when PTPN21 was silenced—as compared with PTPN7,
which we reported previously to have no effect on BAK activation (16). These results at ﬁrst appear counterintuitive
because such an observed increase in BAK activation would
be predicted to be due to the relief from inhibition of BMX
kinase activity that suppressed the initial step of BAK activation
through phosphorylation at Y108. Measurement of the level of
BMX autophosphorylation, a surrogate marker of BMX activity,
by phospho-tyrosine immunoprecipitation–Western blotting
showed that PTPN21 knockdown decreased the activity of BMX
(Fig. 3D). This ﬁnding suggested that BMX acts in concert with
and may require PTPN21 to direct its activity to BAK. It is
therefore the role of PTPN21 in regulating BMX activity, rather
than any direct activity on BAK itself that is important, implying
that the PTPN21–BMX axis is key in determining the level of
BAK phosphorylation at Y108. To test this, we performed
immunoprecipitation–Western blots with an antiserum that
speciﬁcally recognizes BAK that is phosphorylated at Y108.
While pY108–BAK was readily detectable in undamaged cells,
we found that siRNA knockdown of either PTPN21 or BMX

each resulted in markedly decreased levels of pY108–BAK
regardless of the presence of DNA damage (Fig. 3E and
Supplementary Fig. S10). We conclude that BAK is a novel
target of BMX signaling and that BMX is primarily responsible
for maintaining pY108–BAK phosphorylation in these
cells; however, BMX requires PTPN21 for this activity as knockdown of either PTPN21 or BMX leads to BAK underphosphorylation, enabling a potentiation of BAK activation and cell
killing.
BMX overexpression raises the apoptotic threshold of cancer
cell lines
To deﬁne further the link between BMX and BAK and simulate
the effects of BMX overexpression in cancers, we developed a BMX
overexpression cell line model in which we reasoned that the
increased BMX levels would suppress BAK activation following
camptothecin treatment. Transfection of HT1080 cells with plasmids expressing BMX showed that while expression of the wildtype protein was capable of suppressing BAK activation compared
with cells transfected with the pEFIRES vector (38), expression of a
previously characterized kinase-dead BMX mutant (K444Q;
ref. 34) had no effect on BAK activation following camptothecin
treatment (Fig. 4A). In line with this ﬁnding, overexpression of
wild-type BMX also inhibited the release of cytochrome c from
cells treated with camptothecin. Expression of the BMX K444Q
mutant not only failed to suppress cytochrome c release following
camptothecin treatment but instead resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in cytochrome c release, suggesting either that this mutant
acted in a dominant-negative manner or that the activity of other
cellular targets that also impinge upon apoptotic signaling might
have been altered (Fig. 4B). Increasing levels of active BMX in
HT1080 cells also increased the cellular IC50 value about 4-fold as
determined by MTT assay in response to camptothecin from 0.004
to 0.0165 mmol/L, whereas in comparison, cells expressing the
K444Q BMX mutant had an IC50 of 0.005 mmol/L (that was not
signiﬁcantly different from control cells transfected with the
pEFIRES vector). Consistent with these ﬁndings, HT1080 cells
overexpressing BMX showed only a small decrease in phosphorylation of Y108 following camptothecin treatment (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Fig. S11). Together these ﬁndings indicate that
cells with increased levels of BMX maintain BAK phosphorylation
at Y108 and cannot initiate apoptosis, thereby conferring
increased resistance to cytotoxic agents. To further conﬁrm that
the BMX activity on BAK is the key determinant for the observed
increase in resistance to camptothecin, we similarly overexpressed
BMX in HCT116bax-/-,bak-/ cells that have been reconstituted to
express either WT or Y108A-mutant BAK. Overexpression of BMX
was able to block BAK activation in response to camptothecin
treatment, as measured by N-terminal BAK conformational
change, but only in cells expressing WT but not the Y108A BAK
mutant (Fig. 4D).
Knockdown of BMX lowers the apoptotic threshold by
increasing BAK activation
Following on from the reported roles of BMX in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers types, there has been increasing interest
in developing BMX inhibitors (reviewed in ref. 39). Therefore, to
evaluate the effect of BMX inhibition on BAK activation, we
developed cell lines in which BMX was stably knocked down by
shRNA. As predicted, knockdown of BMX alone modulated
pY108 BAK levels (Fig. 3E) but did not cause BAK activation (Fig.

1352 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

5A). However, knockdown of BMX in HT1080 cells signiﬁcantly
increased the amount of BAK that underwent activation, as
measured by BAK N-terminal conformational change, in response
to treatment with camptothecin or etoposide compared with
empty vector controls (Fig. 5A). Levels of BAX conformational
change, however, were not effect by BMX knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S12). Similar potentiation of BAK activation by BMX
knockdown was seen in DU145 prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S13B) treated with docetaxel, an important therapeutic agent currently in widespread clinical use (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S13A), and in the breast cancer cell lines,
BT549 and MCF7, which have high and low/undetectable levels of
BMX, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S14). Overall, the magnitude of the sensitization observed did correlate with the levels of
BMX in the cells, suggesting that BMX may be an excellent
biomarker of cells that are using BMX overexpression as a mechanism to evade apoptosis. The increase in BAK activation in
HT1080 cells correlated with a decrease in cellular IC50 values
as determined by MTT assay (Supplementary Table S1), most
strikingly in response to etoposide treatment where an approximate 10-fold increase in sensitivity was observed in cells with
BMX levels knocked down compared with control cells (Fig. 5C).
This suggested that a dose of etoposide that was nontoxic to the
control cells would elicit cell death in BMX-knockdown cells,
highlighting the huge potential that the use of a BMX inhibitor
could have in combination with existing chemotherapeutic
agents. To test this, BMX-silenced cells were treated with 0.5
mmol/L etoposide, a dose that caused minimal cell killing in
control cells but caused signiﬁcant levels of death in cells with
silenced BMX. Examination of the effects this dose of etoposide
had on BAK activation revealed that 0.5 mmol/L etoposide was
insufﬁcient to trigger BAK dephosphorylation (Fig. 5D) or Nterminal conformational change in the control cells (Fig. 5E).
Whereas in the BMX-knockdown cells, where pY108 BAK levels
were already signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 5D and E), BAK activation was readily detectable as early as 4 hours following etoposide
treatment and continued to increase with time (Fig. 5E), which
correlated with the increase in apoptotic cells observed by
Annexin V staining at the same time points (Fig. 5F). At later
time points, a small increase in Annexin V–positive cells was
apparent in the BMX-knockdown cells that may reﬂect the loss of
other prosurvival activities of BMX unrelated to BAK. To conﬁrm
that the difference in apoptosis observed in the BMX-knockdown
cells was BAK-dependent, transient knockdown of BAK expression
by siRNA in BMX-knockdown cells partially reversed the sensitization to low-dose etoposide, indicating that the increase in
sensitivity observed in this cell system was predominantly caused
by the reduced activity of BMX on BAK (Fig. 5G).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism
through which the activity of the apoptotic machinery can be
suppressed in cancer cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs remain a
main stay of front-line clinical cancer therapy. Improving the
efﬁcacy of treatments or overcoming acquired resistance are
priorities as they can have a major impact on disease progression
and overall survival rates. We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time here
that BMX, acting in concert with PTPN21, phosphorylates the
apoptotic regulator BAK, thereby suppressing BAK activation to
favor survival of cells exposed to cytotoxic agents. These ﬁndings

BMX Mediates Chemoresistance through BAK Inhibition

Figure 6.
Model of proposed mechanism by
which BAK-dependent apoptotic
threshold is determined. The pool of
Y108 dephosphorylated "activationcompetent" BAK available for
activation is dependent on the balance
between the activity of PTPN5 (16)
and BMX.

deﬁne a novel mechanism that helps to explain how cancer
cells can manifest increased resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs that damage cells in different ways. The initial
conversion of BAK from a Y108-phosphorylated to Y108-dephosphorylated form is the key switch that enables BAK activation to
proceed and cause MOMP (16). We now propose that the size of
the pool of Y108-dephosphorylated BAK will determine a given
cell's sensitivity to undergo apoptosis, therefore setting the apoptotic threshold within that cell (Fig. 6). Upregulation of BMX
expression, as observed in many cancer types and cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2), maintains BAK in the inactive Y108 phosphorylated
form, which in turn enables cancer cells to suppress BAK-driven
cell death in response to diverse agents by modulating a single
nodal point that integrates survival versus death signaling in the
apoptotic cascade.
BMX has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer
(22, 40), where elevated levels may compensate for androgen
deprivation (28, 41). Furthermore, a requirement of BMX for
glioblastoma stem cell survival has been identiﬁed (42), as well as
a role for BMX in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer (24). At a
molecular level, BMX has been shown to be involved in controlling a number of important pathways downstream of PI3K
signaling (43, 44), including cell proliferation involving FAK and
PAK1 to promote the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
(25). Furthermore, there are numerous reports that modulation of
BMX expression levels is able to inﬂuence cellular apoptosis (45,
46); however, to date, no BMX substrates directly involved in the
process have been identiﬁed. BMX is known to be activated by
signaling pathways known to promote cell proliferation and
survival (47); therefore, its role in phosphorylating Y108-BAK
that we now propose maintains BAK in an inactive conformation,
thereby providing another level of regulation that helps to push
the life death cellular balance in the direction of survival. Our
ﬁndings, therefore, reveal a mechanism through which BMX plays
a major role in conferring apoptotic resistance to cancer cells, a
function that underpins other pathogenic activities associated
with BMX overexpression.
A clearer understanding of the mutational processes that drive
cancer cells and how they impact on complex signaling networks
that confer survival and growth advantage is ultimately needed.
Genome sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool holding the

www.aacrjournals.org

exciting prospect of identifying genes and pathways altered in
cancer cells that may provide new targets for intervention. However, BMX and BAK have been found to be mutated in only 0.51%
and 0.095%, respectively, of the total samples analyzed (COSMIC
database). Our ﬁndings raise the important prediction that malignancies may still be driven by tyrosine kinase signaling even
though dominant mutations have not been identiﬁed. We propose a paradigm in which signaling pathways subverted through
genetic and epigenetic alterations can impact directly on and
suppress the activity of the otherwise intact apoptotic machinery.
Modulation of a single nodal point in the apoptotic machinery, as
exempliﬁed by the phospho-regulation of BAK, enables diverse
signaling pathways to converge and produce a common phenotypic outcome that favors survival of cancer cells.
With increasing interest in developing speciﬁc BMX inhibitors
(reviewed in ref. 39) and the expansion of clinical trials of existing
agents shown to have activity against BMX, for example, EGFR
inhibitors (48), it would be interesting to investigate the effects of
these agents on the BAK activation pathway. Our study suggests
that, together with any stand-alone activity, these agents may
have, they also have the potential to lower the apoptotic threshold
of tumor cells. We present evidence that BMX inhibition presents
an attractive novel approach to potentiate BAK-driven cell killing
in appropriate combination with cytotoxic drugs. Such combination strategies could be used to both reverse the apoptotic
resistance associated with cancers and render tumor cells susceptible to killing by otherwise sublethal doses of drug, by increasing
the size of the Y108-dephposphorylated BAK pool within the cell.
A further signiﬁcant clinical implication of our results is that we
can identify speciﬁc cancer cell types for which BMX may be an
important biomarker for survival dependency.
In summary, we establish that BMX is the ﬁrst kinase identiﬁed
to phosphorylate the apoptotic regulator BAK. Consistent with
published data, we ﬁnd BMX expression to be upregulated in
numerous cancer types and demonstrate that upregulation of
BMX maintains BAK phosphorylation, thereby enabling the cancer cells to suppress BAK-driven apoptosis in response to diverse
stimuli. Furthermore, reduction of BMX by RNAi signiﬁcantly
lowered the apoptotic threshold of tumor cells rendering them
much more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, we
propose that BMX expression could be used as a biomarker to

identify patients in which inhibition of BMX could be used as a
mechanism to lower the apoptotic threshold of cells to increase
the efﬁcacy of existing cytotoxic agents.
