ABSTRACT
DHX9 is a DExH-box helicase family member with key regulatory roles in a broad
range of cellular processes. It participates at multiple levels of gene regulation,
including DNA replication, transcription, translation, RNA transport, and microRNA
processing. It has been implicated in tumorigenesis and recent evidence suggests that
it may be a promising chemotherapeutic target. Previous studies have determined
that DHX9 suppression elicits an apoptotic or senescence response by activating
p53 signaling. Here, we show that DHX9 inhibition can also have deleterious effects
in cells lacking functional p53. Loss of DHX9 led to increased cell death in p53deficient mouse lymphomas and HCT116 human colon cancer cells, and G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest in p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of mRNA levels
for p53 transcriptional targets showed that a subset of p53 targets in the p53-null
lymphomas and HCT116 cells were activated despite the absence of functional p53.
This implies an alternative pathway of DHX9-mediated activation of cell death and
cell cycle arrest in p53-deficient cells and supports the feasibility of targeting DHX9
in p53-deficient tumors.

INTRODUCTION

We previously identified DHX9 as a modifier of
sensitivity to ABT-737 (an inhibitor of BCL-2 family
pro-survival factors) in a mouse lymphoma model.
Using Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 mouse lymphoma cells, which
overexpressed c-MYC and exogenous BCL-2 and were
resistant to ABT-737, we found that suppression of DHX9
synergized with ABT-737 to reverse resistance. This was
accomplished through aggravation of replicative stress and
activation of p53 signaling, leading to apoptosis [16]. We
subsequently investigated the effect of DHX9 suppression
in non-transformed primary human diploid fibroblasts,
where we demonstrated that loss of DHX9 resulted in
a pronounced growth arrest and premature senescence.
This resulted from inhibition of DNA replication which
activated a p53-dependent stress response [17]. In both the
Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 mouse lymphoma and primary human
fibroblast models, functional p53 signaling was essential
for the ABT-737 synergy or senescence response.
Further exploration of the chemotherapeutic
potential of targeting DHX9 has been carried out in other
mouse and human cancer models. Whereas DHX9 was

DHX9 (also known as Nuclear DNA Helicase II
(NDH II) and RNA Helicase A (RHA)) is an NTP-dependent
helicase belonging to the DExH-box family of helicase
proteins. DHX9 is a multi-domain protein, consisting of
a core helicase domain harboring the conserved DEIH
sequence, two RNA-binding domains at the N-terminus,
a nuclear transport domain and a DNA-binding RGGbox at the C-terminus [1]. It is capable of unwinding a
variety of substrates, including DNA, RNA, and complex
polynucleotide structures [2, 3], and has been implicated
in many diverse biological processes. Its functions
include regulation of transcription [4–6], translation
[7, 8], RNA transport [9], microRNA processing [10],
and DNA replication and genome maintenance [11–14].
Over 30 interacting partners for DHX9 have been
identified, in the context of its various cellular roles [15].
Due to the important regulatory role played by DHX9, there
is growing evidence of its implications in human diseases
such as various cancers and viral infections [15].

targeted in combination with ABT-737 treatment in the
aforementioned Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 lymphomas, it was
found that loss of DHX9 on its own had a lethal effect
on tumor cells where BCL-2 was not supra-elevated.
In MYC-driven TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas, DHX9
suppression had a straight lethal effect both ex vivo and
in vivo [18]. Knockdown of DHX9 in a representative
panel of human cancer cell lines, including multiple
myeloma, osteosarcoma, and breast, lung, and cervical
cancer cells, demonstrated that DHX9 suppression
was detrimental in the majority of cancer cells [18]. In
assessing the levels of various apoptotic and cell cycle
proteins in the different cell lines, we noted that two of
them, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and HeLa cervical
cancer cells, harbored a mutation in p53 or were p53deficient. Despite the absence of functional p53, however,
loss of DHX9 had a deleterious effect on both cell lines
[18]. This suggested that p53 was not the only factor
mediating the apoptotic effect of DHX9 suppression, and
that there may be a p53-independent mechanism triggering
cell death upon DHX9 suppression.
In this study, we investigate the phenomenon and
underlying mechanisms of DHX9-mediated cell death and
growth arrest in p53-deficient systems. We compare the
consequences of DHX9 suppression in p53-wildtype and
p53-deficient settings in three different ex vivo models:
mouse lymphomas, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs),
and human colon cancer cells. We demonstrate that in all
three cases, loss of DHX9 leads to a reduction in cellular
fitness in both p53-wildtype and p53-deficient cells.
Analysis of the levels of p53 transcriptional targets in
each system shows that in the absence of p53, some targets
were nevertheless activated upon DHX9 suppression. Our
results support the existence of a p53-independent aspect
to DHX9-mediated cell death and cell cycle arrest, and
highlight the value of targeting DHX9 in p53-defective
tumors.

previously characterized and shown to contain functional
p53 signaling as well as being highly responsive to DHX9
suppression [18–20]. A competition assay was carried out
in which cells infected with shRNAs targeting DHX9 or
a neutral renilla luciferase control (shRLuc.713) were
co-cultured with non-infected cells (Figure 1A). Cells
harboring DHX9 shRNAs were depleted (represented by
a decrease in %GFP+ cells) in both TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc and
p53−/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas; however, the kinetics of the
depletion was slower in the case of the p53−/−Eµ-Myc
lymphomas (Figure 1A). This result was recapitulated in
INK4A−/− (p53+/+) and p53−/− MEFs (Figure 1B). Here,
shDHX9-expressing cells were depleted in both p53+/+
and p53−/− MEFs, but the kinetics were slower in the latter
compared to the former. We also examined the outcome
of knocking down DHX9 in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116
p53−/− cells. HCT116 p53−/− cells were derived from parental
HCT116 p53+/+ cells through disruption of both alleles of
the p53 gene by homologous recombination and hence
these are isogenic cell lines [21]. As with the lymphomas
and MEFs, both the HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53−/−
cells exhibited depletion of GFP+ cells following DHX9
suppression (Figure 1C). Here, the kinetics of depletion are
relatively similar, with the depletion in the HCT116 p53−/−
cells being only slightly slower than that of the HCT116
p53+/+ cells. The variation in kinetics is unlikely due to
differences in DHX9 knockdown, which were quite similar
in all three pairs of cell lines examined (Figure 1D–1F).
The p53 status in all three cell types was verified by
Western blot analysis, and in the p53+/+ scenarios, DHX9
suppression led to elevation of p53 levels (Figure 1D–1F),
in agreement with prior studies [16–18]. Our results
demonstrating that shDHX9-expressing cells were depleted
in three independent p53-null cell lines support previous
observations that DHX9 suppression can be detrimental to
cells without functional p53.
Whereas p53+/+ and p53−/− isogenic lines were
used for the competition assays in HCT116 cells, the
p53-wildtype and p53-null lymphomas and MEFs were
not isogenic. TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas and INK4A−/−
MEFs were used because they contain functional p53
signaling [18–20, 22]. To verify that the TSC2 status of
the lymphomas does not affect the response of the cells
to DHX9 suppression, we generated isogenic cell lines
where TSC2 was suppressed via shRNA in either p53−/−
Eµ-Myc lymphomas or Arf−/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas (which
harbor functional p53). A comparison of competition
assays performed in control shFLUC.1309 and shTSC2transduced cells showed no significant difference in
the depletion kinetics of GFP+ cells following DHX9
knockdown, in either the p53−/−Eµ-Myc or Arf−/−Eµ-Myc
lymphomas (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1C). This
demonstrates that loss of TSC2 does not affect the cellular
response to DHX9 suppression.
Similarly, to eliminate the possibility that the INK4A
status of the MEFs may represent a confounding factor

RESULTS
DHX9 suppression reduces cellular fitness in
both p53-wildtype and p53-null settings
Previous studies in both non-transformed cells
and tumor models initially suggested that functional p53
signaling is essential for the cell death or senescence
response resulting from DHX9 inhibition [16, 17]. Further
investigation, however, demonstrated that MDA-MB-231
cells, which harbor a point mutation in p53, and HeLa
cells, which are p53-deficient due to overexpression of
the E6 protein from human papillomavirus type 16, also
showed increased cell death upon DHX9 suppression [18].
To characterize this response, we knocked down DHX9
in p53-wildtype and p53-null settings in three different
cell types. p53−/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas were compared to
TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas – the latter of which were

in the DHX9 response, we generated isogenic lines by
knocking out p53 via CRISPR-mediated gene-editing in
INK4A−/− parental cells. p53-mutated cells were selected
using Nutlin-3a, and editing at the p53 locus was confirmed
by T7 endonuclease cleavage, via Western blotting, and by
colony formation assays (Supplementary Figure 2A–2C).
A competition assay performed with control sgROSA
or sgp53-transduced INK4A−/− MEFs showed depletion
of DHX9-expressing cells in both the control and p53edited settings; however, the kinetics were slower in the
latter compared to the former (Supplementary Figure 2D),
despite the two cell lines exhibiting similar robust DHX9
knockdown levels (Supplementary Figure 2E). This
difference in kinetics was comparable to the differences
observed between the INK4A−/− parental MEFs and the
p53−/− MEFs. Hence, the TSC2 or INK4A status of the
cells used in this study does not appear to significantly
affect the response to DHX9 suppression. The TSC2+/−EµMyc lymphomas and INK4A−/− MEFs were therefore used
as control lines for the remainder of this study.

p53−/− cells displayed any significant changes in cell cycle
distribution, suggesting that depletion of the shDHX9expressing cells was likely solely due to induction of cell
death rather than growth arrest (Figure 2F). Both TSC2+/−
Eµ-Myc and p53−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas underwent a
slight S-phase arrest upon loss of DHX9, with a small
(3.5–4.6%) increase in the percentage of S-phase cells and
a concomitant decrease in G2/M-phase cells (Figure 2D);
however, cell death appeared to be the primary mechanism
by which DHX9 suppression reduced the proliferative
fitness of the lymphomas. These results indicate that
irrespective of the p53 status, DHX9 suppression may
elicit a cell death or cell cycle arrest response, or a
combination of both, depending on the cellular context.

DHX9 suppression activates p53 targets in both
p53-wildtype and p53-null systems
To better understand how loss of DHX9 elicits a cell
death or growth arrest response in p53-wildtype and p53null systems, we quantified the relative mRNA levels of
a set of known, previously validated p53 transcriptional
target genes [16, 23] using quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
Nine p53 target genes were analyzed in TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc
and p53−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas, INK4A−/− and p53−/−
MEFs, and HCT116 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells, six days after
transduction with control or DHX9 shRNAs. Amongst
these were the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins PUMA, BAX, NOXA,
BIM, the c-MYC oncogene, and other targets MDM2,
PLK2, and SESN1. DHX9 knockdown and p53 levels
were validated in the RNA samples for each cell type
(Figures 3A, 4A, and 5A). p53 mRNA levels were not
elevated in response to DHX9 knockdown, suggesting
that the observed increase in p53 protein (Figure 1D–1F)
is likely due to a post-transcriptional response. DHX9
suppression in TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc cells resulted in elevated
levels of p21, PUMA, BAX, NOXA, BIM, c-MYC, and
PLK2. Of these, NOXA and PLK2 were also elevated
in p53−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas; however, the magnitude
of induction for both genes was approximately 1.5–2fold less than that experienced in the TSC2+/−EµMyc lymphomas (Figure 3B). p21, BIM, MDM2, and
SESN1 levels were significantly increased upon DHX9
knockdown in INK4A−/− MEFs, but none of the p53
targets tested appeared to be activated in p53−/− MEFs
(Figure 4B). p21, PUMA, BAX, NOXA, BIM, MDM2,
c-MYC, PLK2 and SESN1 transcript levels increased
following DHX9 suppression in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, and
the HCT116 p53−/− cells exhibited significant increases in
NOXA, c-MYC, and PLK2 levels (Figure 5B). Similar
to what was observed in the lymphomas, the magnitude
of the increases in NOXA and PLK2 was approximately
1.5–2-fold less in the HCT116 p53−/− cells compared to
HCT116 p53+/+ cells. We also examined the protein levels
of the p53 targets in the HCT116 cells. Immunoblot

Context-dependent effects of DHX9 suppression
in p53-deficient cells
To gain insight into the underlying causes for the
difference in kinetics observed between p53-wildtype and
p53-deficient systems, we quantitated the levels of cell
death that ensued following DHX9 knockdown. DHX9
suppression resulted in a ~1.5-fold increase in cell death
in p53−/−Eµ- Myc lymphomas, compared to a ~3-fold
increase in TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas (Figure 2A);
this difference in the extent of cell death induced is
consistent with the slower kinetics of depletion exhibited
by the p53−/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas in the competition assay
(Figure 1A). In the MEFs, neither the INK4A−/− nor the
p53−/− MEFs showed an increase in cell death (Figure 2B).
The HCT116 p53−/− cells exhibited a 2.9–3.5-fold increase
in cell death, compared to a 4.4–4.9 fold increase in p53+/+
cells (Figure 2C), which again, was consistent with the
slight difference in kinetics observed in the competition
assay. Given that the MEFs showed no induction of
cell death upon DHX9 suppression, we carried out cell
cycle analysis on the three different cell types following
transduction with control or DHX9 shRNAs. Indeed, the
INK4A−/− MEFs exhibited a marked increase (~24%)
in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase, and a ~12%
decrease in the number of cells in both the S and G2/M
phases upon DHX9 suppression, indicating a G0/G1
growth arrest. In the case of the p53−/− MEFs, changes in
cell cycle distribution following DHX9 knockdown were
smaller, with a ~15% increase in the number of cells in
G0/G1 phase, a 10% decrease in the cells in S phase, and
a ~5% decrease in the number of cells in the G2/M phase
(Figure 2E). This correlated with the slower kinetics of
depletion in the competition assay for the p53−/− MEFs
(Figure 1B). Neither the HCT116 p53+/+ nor the HCT116

analysis showed increases in the protein levels of the p53
targets which corresponded to the mRNA data in HCT116
cells (Figure 6). In particular, NOXA, c-MYC, and PLK2
protein levels were significantly upregulated in both the
p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells. These results illustrate
that in cells harboring functional p53, DHX9 suppression
activates a transcriptional program consisting of several
targets known to lead to cell death or cell cycle arrest. In
the absence of p53, a subset of classic p53 targets is also
activated and this may contribute to the cell death response
elicited in these cells.
Having observed an effect on the expression of
pro-apoptotic genes following DHX9 suppression, it
is also possible that down-regulation of anti-apoptotic
genes played a role in inducing cell death. Indeed, p53
can mediate transcriptional repression of certain anti-

apoptotic proteins [24–28]. We examined the transcript
levels of three known anti-apoptotic p53 targets: BCL-2,
MCL-1, and survivin. We observed no change in expression
of these genes upon DHX9 suppression in the three different
cell lines, with or without functional p53 (Supplementary
Figure 3A–3C). We also observed no change in the protein
levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 (Figure 6A). This suggests that
induction of cell death in response to DHX9 knockdown in
the lymphomas and HCT116 cells is likely a consequence
of increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors rather than
downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins.
In the absence of functional p53, it has been
reported that other transcriptional factors may activate p53
targets (see DISCUSSION). To gain further insight into
the mechanism by which the p53 targets may be activated
in the p53-null cells, we examined the protein levels of

several known alternative transcription factors in HCT116
cells: the p53 family members p73 and p63, c-MYC,
E2F1, and FOXO3A (Figure 6). Of these, only c-MYC
levels showed an increase (~2-fold) in p53−/− HCT116
cells. Hence, c-MYC may contribute to induction of cell
death in the p53-null setting.

aberrant replication and genomic instability [29]. p53
transcriptional targets include the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21 [30, 31], the tumor suppressor PTEN [32],
members of the BCL-2 family of pro-apoptotic factors such
as PUMA, NOXA, and BAX [33–36], as well as components
of the apoptotic effector machinery (e.g. APAF-1
and caspase-6) [37–40]. It is among the most frequently
mutated gene in human cancer, with over 50% of cancers
harboring a defect in p53 [41, 42]. Since many traditional
genotoxic agents act through p53 to induce apoptosis or cell
cycle arrest, this poses a problem for chemotherapy because
it restricts the use of these agents to settings where p53 is
functional. Investigating means of eliciting a cell cycle
arrest or cell death response in the absence of functional
p53 is therefore of great therapeutic interest.

DISCUSSION
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central regulatory
role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair.
It transcriptionally activates genes with a wide range of
functions in response to cellular stresses such as DNA
damage, reactive oxygen species, and replication stress,
allowing the cell to arrest or undergo apoptosis to prevent

Previous studies from our research group
have supported the notion of inhibiting DHX9 as
a chemotherapeutic approach, primarily in p53wildtype settings. In the present study, we assessed the
consequences of suppressing DHX9 in p53-deficient
cells and compared the outcome to that achieved in p53wildtype scenarios. We demonstrated that p53-null mouse
lymphomas, MEFs, and HCT116 cells are susceptible to
DHX9 suppression.
We chose to examine whether common p53 targets
were also being activated in p53-null cells. In TSC2+/−EµMyc lymphomas, DHX9 suppression resulted in elevated
levels of p21, PUMA, BAX, NOXA, BIM, c-MYC, and
PLK2. This is consistent with activation of an apoptotic
program previously observed in mouse lymphomas upon

DHX9 suppression [16]. We found that NOXA and PLK2
were also elevated in p53−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas. A similar
situation was observed with the p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116
cells: induction of p21, PUMA, BAX, NOXA, BIM,
MDM2, c-MYC, PLK2, and SESN1 mRNA in the p53+/+
cells and of NOXA, c-MYC, and PLK2 in the p53−/− cells.
Upregulation of these genes was confirmed at the protein
level in the HCT116 cells (Figure 6). The fact that we
observed increased levels of NOXA and PLK2 in both
p53-null lymphomas and HCT116 cells suggests that these
two proteins may be involved in common p53-independent
pathways of activating programmed cell death. The smaller
magnitude of increase in NOXA and PLK2 levels in the
p53-null cells, as well as the observation that fewer p53
targets were activated in the p53-null cells compared to

shown that many bona fide p53 targets can be activated
in p53-deficient settings. In some cases, p53-independent
activation occurs through upregulation by other
transcription factors. For example, aside from p53, p21
transcription can also be activated by E2F1, E2F3, SP1,
SP3, members of the Krüppel-like transcription factor
(KLF) family (e.g. KLF4 and KLF6), CDX2, BETA2,
MYOD1, and a variety of nuclear receptors [47–51].
Much attention has been given to the p53 family member,
p73, and its role in cell cycle control and apoptosis. p73
shares significant structural homology with p53, binds to
canonical p53 promoter elements, and can transactivate
many p53-dependent promoters [52–54]. Although p73
is known to function cooperatively with p53 and another
p53 homolog, p63 [55], it can also activate p53 targets
independently of p53. Notably, p73 can transcriptionally

the p53-wildtype cells, may be responsible for the slower
kinetics of depletion and lower levels of cell death induced
upon DHX9 loss in the p53-null cells. DHX9 suppression
in INK4A−/− MEFs resulted in increased levels of p21, BIM,
MDM2, and SESN1, all of which are known mediators of
cell cycle arrest [30, 31, 43–46]. In contrast to what was
observed in the p53-wildtype lymphomas and HCT116
cells, no changes in pro-apoptotic factors PUMA, BAX,
and NOXA were exhibited by the INK4A−/− MEFs. This is
consistent with the different cell fates (cell cycle arrest in
the MEFs versus apoptosis in the lymphomas and HCT116
cells) resulting from DHX9 suppression (Figure 2).
While activation of p53 signaling is the canonical
pathway by which apoptosis or cell cycle arrest is
triggered, these processes have also been documented
to occur in a p53-independent manner. Studies have

activate NOXA, PUMA, and p21 in p53-deficient cells in
response to a variety of genotoxic stimuli [56–58]. p21,
NOXA, PUMA, and BIM are also transactivated by the
transcription factors E2F1 [59–62] and FOXO3A [63–66]
in a p53-independent manner. c-MYC is another activator
of NOXA [67]. Hence, cell cycle arrest or programmed cell
death via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway can take place in
p53-deficient settings by virtue of activation of cell cycle
or apoptotic proteins by these other transcription factors.
Examination of the protein levels of the aforementioned
possible alternative transcription factors showed that
c-MYC levels were increased in p53−/− HCT116 cells
(Figure 6). Given that activation of NOXA by c-MYC has

been previously reported [67], it is possible that c-MYC
may contribute to p53-independent induction of cell death
by transcriptionally activating NOXA. While none of
the other known alternative transcription factors showed
activation upon DHX9 suppression in the p53-null setting,
it is possible that yet-unidentified transcription factors may
also contribute to the apoptotic response. In addition, cell
cycle arrest may proceed via activation of the p16-RB1
pathway independently of both p53 and p21 [68], which
may be a possibility for the p53−/− MEFs given that none
of the p53 targets examined showed any upregulation
upon DHX9 suppression (Figure 4B). Taken together,
our results suggest that DHX9-mediated cell death in the

p53−/− lymphomas and HCT116 cells may involve p53independent upregulation of NOXA and PLK2, which may
be activated by transcription factors other than p53.
We have previously shown that DHX9 suppression
resulted in senescence in primary human diploid fibroblasts
and synergized with ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in Arf−/−
Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 mouse lymphoma cells, in a p53-dependent
manner [16, 17]. Here, we show that DHX9 loss can also
have deleterious effects in p53-deficient cells. Taken
together, these results indicate that the consequences of
DHX9 suppression will be context-dependent. We have
observed that DHX9 knockdown results in a cell death
response in the majority of tumor cell lines but a growth
arrest response in non-transformed cells. Loss of DHX9
also has a differential effect in mouse tissues in vivo versus
cell lines ex vivo, as previously revealed [18]. It is therefore
conceivable that p53 may be required for DHX9-mediated
cell cycle arrest and senescence in non-transformed
primary cells but not for a cell cycle arrest or apoptotic
response in immortalized cell lines or tumor cells, which
harbor significant differences in their biological wiring.
Indeed, there are previously documented instances where a
particular agent may cause p53-dependent apoptosis in one
cellular context but p53-independent apoptosis in another.
In one example, sepsis-induced apoptosis was found to
be p53-dependent in thymocytes but p53-independent
in splenocytes [69]. In another case, paclitaxel-mediated
apoptosis was p53-dependent in EIA-transformed MEFs,
but when the cells were simultaneously exposed to the
cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), the effect
became p53-independent [70]. In conclusion, our study
supports the presence of a p53-independent mechanism
of cell death and cell cycle arrest resulting from DHX9
inhibition. While further work is required to characterize
this effect in greater depth, our results support the
feasibility of targeting DHX9 as a chemotherapeutic
approach in p53-deficient tumors.

with Eµ-Myc mice. Lymphomas were cultured in B-cell
media (45% DMEM, 45% Iscove’s media, 55 mM
β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum) on irradiated
INK4A−/− MEF feeder layers.

Plasmids, virus generation and transductions
For suppression of DHX9 in murine cell lines (MEFs
and Eµ-Myc lymphomas), two independent shRNAs
targeting mouse DHX9 (shDHX9.1241 and shDHX9.1271)
and a control shRNA targeting renilla luciferase
(shRLuc.713) were transduced into cells using the
MSCV/LTR/miR30/PuroR-IRES-GFP (MLP) or MSCV/
LTR/miR30/SV40-GFP (MLS-GFP) retroviral vectors.
Retroviral infections were generated using ecotropic
Phoenix packaging cells following established protocols
(https://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/_OldWebsite/
retroviral_systems/retsys.html). For infections using MLP,
stable integrants were selected using 2 μg/ml puromycin
for at least 2 days after the final infection. For suppression
of DHX9 in HCT116 cells, two shRNAs targeting human
DHX9 (shDHX9.860 and shDHX9.267) and a control
shRNA targeting firefly luciferase (shFLuc.1309) were
transduced into cells using pPrime-PGK-Puro (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Lentiviral transduction was
performed following published procedures [71]. All
shRNAs in this study were cloned into the miR30 backbone
of their corresponding vectors via unique XhoI and EcoRI
restriction sites [72]. The guide strand sequences of the
shRNAs have been previously published [18].
For generation of TSC2-knockdown murine cell
lines, p53−/− Eµ-Myc or Arf−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas
were transduced with either an shRNA targeting TSC2
(shTSC2) or the shFLUC.1309 control, using the MSCV/
LTR/miR30/SV40-mCherry (MLS-mCherry) retroviral
vector. Cells were sorted for the mCherry+ expressing
population. The guide strand sequence of the TSC2
shRNA is 5′GGCCCGATATGTGTTCTCCAAT3′.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ex vivo competition assays

Cell lines and cell culture

Ex vivo competition assays were performed by
transducing cells with MLS-GFP-based (for lymphomas
and MEFs) or pPrime-PGK-puro-based (for HCT116
cells) shRNAs. The percentage of GFP-positive cells
was measured 48h after the final infection (t = 0) using
a GUAVA EasyCyte HT flow cytometer (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), and assessed every 2–3 days
thereafter. Cell death was assessed by staining cells
with 4  μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and measuring the
percentage of PI-positive cells.

HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA),
INK4A−/− p53+/+ MEFs, and TSC2+/+ p53−/− MEFs (a kind
gift from Dr. David Kwiatkowski (Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, USA)) were maintained in DMEM (Multicell,
St-Bruno, QC, Canada). HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116
p53−/− cells were maintained in McCoy 5A (Multicell).
Media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Multicell). TSC2+/−Eµ−Myc lymphoma cells were
derived from tumors in TSC2+/− mice crossed with Eµ-Myc
mice. TSC2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas retained wildtype p53,
as determined by sequencing across all p53 coding exons
and Western blot analysis following γ-irradiation [20].
Similarly, p53−/− Eµ-Myc and Arf−/− Eµ-Myc lymphomas
were derived from tumors in p53−/− or Arf−/− mice crossed

harvested from a 6 cm plate, washed twice with PBS
containing 1% BSA and 5 mM EDTA, resuspended in 50 μl
PBS on ice, fixed with 1.25 ml 70% ethanol, and stored at
–20°C until further processing. The fixed cells were then
treated with 0.5% Triton X-100/ 2 M HCl, neutralized with
0.1 M sodium borate [pH 8.5], washed with PBS containing
1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100, and resuspended in 500 µL
of PBS containing 5 μg/mL PI (Sigma). The cell cycle
profile of the cells was assessed using a GUAVA EasyCyte
HT flow cytometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

Generation of CRISPR-edited INK4A−/− MEFs
INK4A−/−MEFs were transduced with sgRNAs
targeting p53 (sgp53-1) or the ROSA control (sgROSA)
as previously described [73], using the pQCX/sgRNA/
Cas9/mCherry (QCiC) retroviral vector. Cells were sorted
for a pure mCherry+ population and sgp53-transduced
cells were treated with 10 μM Nutlin-3a to select for
cells harboring editing at the p53 locus. To verify editing,
T7 endonuclease cleavage assays and colony formation
assays were performed as previously described [73].
