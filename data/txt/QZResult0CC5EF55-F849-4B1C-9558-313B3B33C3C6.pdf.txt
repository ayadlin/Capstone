ABSTRACT
MicroRNA128-1 (miR128-1), as a brain-specific miRNA, is downregulated in
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and closely associated with the progression of GBM.
However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the downregulation and its role in
the regulation of tumorigenesis and anticancer drug resistance in GBM remains largely
unknown. In the current study,we found that miR128-1 was downregulated in GBM
and glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). Intriguingly, treatment with the DNA methylation
inhibitors 5-Aza-CdR (Aza) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) resulted in miR128-1
upregulation in both GBM cells and GSCs. Either forced expression of miR128-1 or
Aza/PBA treatment inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.
Moreover, overexpression of miR128-1 inhibited the growth of transplant tumor in
vivo. BMI1 and E2F3 were found to be direct targets of miR128-1 and downregulated
by miR128-1 in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed a mechanism of methylation
that controls miR128-1 expression in GBM cells and GSCs and indicate miR128-1
could function as a tumor suppressor in GBM by negatively regulating tumor cell
proliferation, invasion and self-renewal through direct targeting BMI1 and E2F3.
Our findings suggest that DNA methylation inhibitors are potential agents for GBM
treatment by upregulating miR-128-1.

self-renewal and the ability to grow as neurospheres in
culture [2, 3]. This subpopulation of tumor cells is also
known as glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and believed to
give rise to the heterogeneity of GBM cancer cells and
contribute to the resistance to currently available antitumor therapies. It is believed that novel therapeutics
targeting GSCs could be more effective than traditional
anti-glioblastoma chemotherapy [4]. However, the precise
mechanism of the regulation of the proliferation, survival
and maintenance of GSCs remains elusive.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs
(19-22 nt) that negatively regulate gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level. More than 600 miRNAs
have been identified in human cells; Increasing data
have demonstrated that miRNAs play vital roles in most
biological processes, including apoptosis, proliferation,
differentiation, development and the metabolism [5, 6].
miRNA deregulation has been observed in most cancer

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults
and approximately 20,000 new cases are diagnosed in the
United States every year. In the past decade, significant
advances have been made in the treatment of GBM;
however, even with aggressive systematic surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy, the median survival of
GBM patients remains shorter than 15 months [1]. The
aggressive and diffuse infiltrative growth of GBM is the
current challenge for the management of GBM patients.
It is thus urgent to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the initiation, progression, maturation and
maintenance of GBM, and identify novel strategies for the
treatment of GBM patients.
Mounting evidence has shown that glioblastoma
cells retain features of neural progenitor cells, including

types and plays an important role in the multiple steps of
tumorigenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes [7]. In glioblastoma,
microRNA deregulation is closely associated with the
differentiation, proliferation, invasion and self-renewal
of tumor cells [8, 9]. Particularly, expression of the
“brain-specific” miRNA miR128-1 is associated with
normal brain development [10]. Recently, significant
downregulation of miR128-1 expression was found in
glioblastomas and associated with aggressive glioblastoma
cell growth [11], but the underlying molecular mechanism
of the deregulation of miR128-1 in glioblastoma remains
largely unknown.
In the present study, we have investigated the
regulation of miR128-1 gene transcription and the
downstream targets of miR128-1 in GBM and cultured
glioblastoma stem-like cells.

much higher miR128-1 levels than cells infected with
lentivirus containing miR-NC. Surprisingly, miR128-1
levels were 2-3 fold higher after infection in GSCs than in
their original cell lines (Figure 1F). These results suggest
that miR128-1 expression is either upregulated or that the
miR128-1 molecule is more stable in GSCs.

Methylation inhibitors Aza and PBA increase
miR128-1 expression in glioma cells and GSCs
Previous studies showed that DNA methylation
was correlated with the downregulation of miR128-1 in
colorectal cancer [14] and osteoarthritic cartilage [15].
To assess whether DNA methylation plays a role in the
downregulation of miR128-1 in glioma cells, we treated
glioma U87 and U251 cells and their respective GSCs
with the epigenetic methylation inhibitors Aza and PBA.
We observed that miR128-1 expression was elevated in all
cells following treatment with Aza and PBA (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, the increase of miR128-1 expression in
GSCs was significantly higher than their respective
glioma cell lines. The data suggest that epigenetic
methylation might at least in part contribute to miR128-1
downregulation in glioma cells, especially GSCs.
To identify potential methylation sites in the
promoter region of the miR128-1 gene, we analyzed
the CGIs database to identify CGIs within the miR1281 gene and found three CGIs at sequence 26, 32 and
72. We next performed bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP)
to assess the methylation status of the miR128-1 gene
in U87, U251, U87-GSCs and U251-GSCs. CGIs were
found in all cell lines (Figure 2B). Consistent with our
observation of higher miR128-1 levels in U87 than U251
cells (Figure 1E), there were one or two methylation
sites in U251-GSCs. Impressively, all methylation
sites (26, 32 and 72) were present in U87 and U251
cells, consistent with the higher miR128-1 expression
in U251-GSCs than in U251 (Figure 1E). Thus,
methylation at the 26, 32 and 72 sites may contribute to
miR128-1 downregulation in glioma cells.

RESULTS
miR128-1 transfection results in higher miR1281 levels in GSCs than in glioma cells
We established GSCs by culturing U87 and U251
cell lines in DMEM/F12 medium containing B27 and
relevant growth factors according to the methods as
previously described [12]. Gliospheres were formed
within 7-10 days and GSC phenotypes, positive expression
of CD133, nestin and GFAP were verified using light
microscopy, flow cytometry and immuofluorescence
microscopy (Figure 1A). GSCs morphological features
were further confirmed using scanning electron
microscopy (Figure 1B). Stem cell cloning formation
experiments demonstrated the self-renewal capacity
of GSCs (Figure 1C). In addition, differentiation assay
showed the differentiation of GSCs to glioma cells
(Figure 1D). These results demonstrated the successful
establishment of GSCs derived from U87 and U251 cell
lines.
It has been shown that the expression level of
miR128-1 is higher in brain than in glioblastoma [13]. To
assess the expression status of miR128-1 in glioblastoma
cells derived GSCs, we used microarray analysis to
compare miR128-1 expression in GSCs with parental
U87 and U251 cell lines and normal human brain tissues.
When compared to normal brain tissues, miR128-1
expression was downregulated in GSCs as well as the
corresponding U87 and U251 cell lines (Figure 1E).
Nevertheless, miR128-1 was increased in both U87-GSCs
and U251-GSCs when compared with U87 and U251
cells, respectively, suggesting a role for miR128-1 in the
maintenance of the stemness of GSCs. Next, we infected
U87 and U251 cells and their respective GSCs derivatives
with lentiviral vectors containing miR128-1 primary
transcripts or negative control DNA (NC). Cells infected
with the lentivirus containing miR128-1 mimic showed

miR128-1 directly targets BMI1 and E2F3 in
glioblastoma cells
A number of cell type-dependent miR128-1
potential downstream target genes have been reported,
including but not limited to BMI1, CSF1, KLF4,
LIN28A, NANOG, SNAIL and E2F3 [16]. BMI1, a
component of the PRC2 polycomb repressor complex,
has emerged as the most important player for the selfrenewal and malignant transformation of glioma [17,
18]. In silico analyses predicted highly conserved
binding sites in the 3’-UTR of BMI1 (positions 480 488) and 3’-UTR of E2F3 (positions 2039 - 2045) for
miR128-1 [16, 19]. To confirm miR128-1 targeting of
BMI1 and E2F3 in glioblastoma cells, we measured

BMI1 and E2F3 expression in U251 and U87 cells after
miR128-1 transfection. Significant decrease in BMI1
and E2F3 mRNAs was observed in both U251 and
U87 cells following transfection of miR128-1 mimics
(Figure 3A). Consistent with the downregulation of
mRNAs, transfection of miR128-1 mimics significantly

reduced BMI1 and E2F3 protein levels in both U251
and U87 cells (Figure 3B). To further support the
observation that BMI1 and E2F3 are direct targets of
miR128-1, dual luciferase assays were performed using
glioma cells transfected with BMI1 and E2F3 reporter
constructs with or without miR128-1 (Figure 3C).

miR128-1 overexpression suppresses the
proliferation, migration and clonogenicity of
glioblastoma cells in vitro

As expected, luciferase activity in glioma cells was
reduced by co-transfection of the BMI1 construct and
miR128-1, while mutation of BMI1’s 3’-UTR miR1281 binding sites abrogated reduction of luciferase
activity by miR128-1 (Figure 3D). Similar results were
observed after co-transfection of the E2F3 construct
and miR128-1 (Figure 3E). Taken together, these data
indicate that miR128-1 directly targets BMI1 and E2F3
in glioblastoma cells.

We next assessed whether miR128-1 overexpression
would have an effect on the cell proliferation, migration
and colony formation of cultured glioma cells and
GSCs. Transfection of miR128-1 for 48 hrs apparently
decreased the proliferation of glioma U251 and U87

cells when compared with controls (Figure 4A, upper

and U87-GSCs was obviously reduced by miR128-1
transfection (Figure 4A, lower panel). Consistent with
miR128-1 suppression by methylation, U251 and U87

cells treated with combination of Aza and PBA displayed
reduced cell growth (Figure 4B). Similarly, miR128-1
overexpression (Figure 5A) or treatment with 3 μM of
Aza plus 3 mM of PBA (Figure 5B) inhibited wound

radioactivity data from injected 18F-FDG and 18F-RGD
was collected every three days. Live glioma xenografts
growth in the brain was monitored using MicroPET after
days 5 (Figure 6A). The tumor volume of U251-GSCs
group was significantly larger than U251 group (p<0.01)

than that of NC group (p<0.01) (Figure 6B). Interestingly,
when compared to U251 group, faster tumor growth and
more active 18F-FDG uptake were observed in U251-

GSCs group. 18F-RDG radioactivity was inhibited by
miR128-1 overexpression in both U251 cells and U251GSCs, indication of suppression of tumor growth by
miR128-1. Similarly, analysis by 18F-RGD showed that
miR128-1 overexpression significantly impeded the tumor
growth of both U251 and U251-GSCs tumor xenografts
(Figure 6C, 6D). Histologically, when compared with the
U251 group, large hyperchromatic nuclei with atypical
mitosis were more common in miR128-1 transfected

showed that the expression of BMI1, E2F3 and Ki-67

was decreased DNA methylation in the miR128-1 gene in
GSCs in comparison to the corresponding parental glioma
cells and treatment of both GBM cells and GSCs with
the DNA methylation inhibitors Aza and PBA resulted in
miR128-1 up-regulation. Finally, we showed that miR1281 overexpression impeded the growth of glioblastoma
mouse tumor xenografts. Our results demonstrated
that aberrant miR128-1 methylation is associated with
miR128-1 downregulation in glioma especially in GSCs,
suggesting miR128-1 and demethylating agents are
promising for glioma treatment.
As a “brain-specific” miRNA, miR128-1 has a
tissue-specific expression pattern, and is expressed mainly
in neurons rather than in astrocytes [10]. Additionally,
miR128-1 is present in terminally differentiated mature
neurons, but absent in neural stem cells [20]. miR1281 is encoded by two distinct intronic genes, miR128-1
and miR128-2, which are embedded in the introns of the
R3HDM1 (R3H domain containing 1) and RCS (cyclic
AMP-regulated phosphoprotein) genes that are located

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated miR128-1 was
downregulated in glioma cells and their GSCs when
compared with normal brain tissues; however the
miR128-1 level in GSCs was restively higher than the
corresponding parental glioma cells. Furthermore, we
showed that miR128-1 targeted BMI1 and E2F3, and
miR128-1 overexpression down-regulated BMI1 and E2F3
in glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in mouse tumor
xenografts. Most importantly, we discovered that there

on human chromosomes 2q21.3 and 3p22.3, respectively
[21, 22]. Although most intronic miRNAs depend on host
gene expression for transcription and are processed from
the same primary transcript, some mammalian intronic
miRNAs might be transcribed from their own promoters. In
the case of miR128-1, three SNPs are located in the genomic
region corresponding to hsa-miR128-1, and the international
HapMap project has observed strong geographical genetic
variation among different populations in this gene [23]. In
miR128-2, the Pol III promoter is found in the 5’-flanking
region, it will be interesting to investigate whether the
expression of miR128-2 depends on its host gene ARPP-21
[24, 25]. Aberrant miR128-1 expression has been observed
in many malignancies. Although miR128-1 downregulation
has been reported in GBM and neuroblastoma, miR1281 upregulation has also been reported in acute myeloid
leukemia and letrozole-resistant breast cancer cell lines [11].
These findings indicate that miR128-1 can function as either
an oncogenic or a tumor-suppressive miRNA, depending
on the specific tumor type. In glioma tissues, miR128-1
expression was found to be downregulated when compared
with normal human brain tissues [26, 27]; however, the
mechanism of miR128-1 deregulation in glioma tissues
remains to be determined. In the present study, we
provided direct evidence that epigenetic methylation of
miR128-1 is one of the mechanisms underlying miR128-1
downregulation in glioma.
The heterogeneous nature of glioma cells is believed
to contribute to their chemotherapy resistance and patient
relapse after therapy [28]. Although the hierarchical
structure of gliomas and the models of heterogeneity are
controversial, the presence and contribution of the tumorinitiating GSCs to heterogeneity has been well established
[29, 30]. Interestingly, we found that ectopic miR128-1
expression lead to higher overall miR128-1 expression in
GSCs when compared to glioma cell lines, suggesting an
unknown mechanism promoting miR128-1 expression
or stabilizing miR128-1 in GSCs. To test this hypothesis,
we treated glioma cells and their GSCs with Aza and
PBA, a potent DNA methylation inhibitor and a histone
deacetylase inhibitor, respectively. After Aza and PBA
treatment, miR128-1 upregulation was observed in both
glioma cells and their GSCs. Similar to the miR128-1 mimic
transfection, inhibition of DNA methylation induced higher
miR128-1 expression in GSCs. It is believed that Aza and
PBA may reduce DNA methylation levels and then open
chromatin structures, thereby inducing the re-expression of
epigenetically silenced genes [31, 32]. Indeed, inhibition
of DNA methylation by Aza and PBA resulted in elevated
expression of miR128-1 in both glioma cells and GSCs.
Furthermore, we identified three DNA methylation sites
in miR128-1 by performing BSP sequencing. One of three
CpG islands in the miR128-1 gene was methylated in U251GSCs while all three were methylated in U251 cells. These
data indicate that DNA methylation downregulates miR1281 expression in glioma cells and decreased DNA methylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

contributes to the relatively increased expression of miR1281 in GSCs compared with the parental glioma cells.
Several studies have explored miR128-1 target
genes that may potentially play a role in the regulation
of cell differentiation and self-renewal [33]. Of the stem
cell-related genes, BMI1 is one of the most important
miR128-1 targets. BMI1 is a component of the polycomb
repressor complex (PRC), and suppresses the expression
of key target genes through chromatin modification.
BMI1 also plays a role in stem cell renewal and serves as
a neural stem cell and glioma maintenance factor [17, 18,
34]. Consistent with the observations in prostate cancer
[16], our study found that miR128-1 negatively regulated
BMI1 expression in glioma cells through its predicted
miR128-1 binding site. Additionally, we found that E2F3,
a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle progression,
was also a direct target of miR128-1. Accordingly,
miR128-1 overexpression resulted in reduced expression
of both BMI1 and E2F3 in glioma cells and GSCs. These
results indicate that one of the mechanisms by which
miR128-1 regulates cell differentiation and self-renewal
is via the targeting of BMI1 and E2F3.
In addition, our results demonstrated that miR128-1
inhibited the growth of glioma. miR128-1 overexpression
inhibited the sphere-forming activities, proliferation and
migration of cultured glioma cells. In the in vivo study,
we employed miroPET scanning to monitor tumor growth
in mice without sacrificing mice. 18F-RGD and 18F-FDG
are radioactive tracers that are a tumor metabolism
markers and can be used to observe live tumor growth in
vivo. Interestingly, MicroPET scans of glioma xenograftbearing mice showed lower activity for both tracers in the
brains of miR128-1 overexpressing U251 or U251-GSCs
cells, indicating the tumor growth was inhibited in mice
transplanted with miR128-1 overexpressed cells. It has
been well accepted that ultimate cure of cancer depends
on the elimination of cancer stem cells.
In conclusion, we found that miR128-1 level
was relatively higher in GSCs than glioma cells, DNA
methylation negatively regulated miR128-1 expression in
glioma cells and overexpression of miR128-1 suppressed
the growth of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our
results confirmed the published data that miR-128 inhibits
glioma proliferation and self-renewal via targeting Bmi-1
[8] and revealed a new mechanism by which miR128-1 is
deregulated in glioma. Our findings suggest that miR1281 and DNA demethylating agents are promising for antiglioma therapy at least in part by eliminating GSCs.

Cell transfection and drug treatment

Vector construction

Transfection of miR128-1 mimic oligonucleotide
(200nM) and negative control (NC) (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China) was performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Twenty-four hrs after transfection, cells were harvested and
RNA was extracted for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis.
For the methylation inhibition experiments, glioma cells
were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 10 cm dish for 24 hrs before
treatment with Aza (1 μM or 3 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) or PBA
(1 mM or 3 mM, Sigma-Aldrich). For the combination
treatment, cells were treated with Aza for 24 hrs, followed
by PBA treatment for an additional 5 days.

A 377-bp fragment of miR128-1 gene was amplified
by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from human brain
tissue and cloned into vector pcDNA3.1 (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). A 3’-untranslated region (UTR)
luciferase reporter vector was constructed by ligating a
fragment of the BMI1 and E2F3a 3’-UTR encompassing
the miR128-1 binding sequence into the pcDNA3.1-luc
vector (Promega). The predicted miR128-1 target site
CACTGTG was converted to ACGACAC by site-directed
mutagenesis. Primer sets (5’ - 3’) were as follows: miR1281 cloning, GATTTTAGGTTTACAAAGCCCTAGCTGT
and
CTAATCCCTATTTCTGAGTATGATGCATGA;

migrate for 24 - 48 hrs at 37°C. After migration, cells
in the top chambers were removed using a cotton swab
and the cells that migrated to the bottom chambers were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich) and
stained with Crystal Violet. The fixed and stained cells
were counted in five independent fields under a light
microscope. At least three chambers were counted for each
experiment.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were trypsinized and Accutase (Millipore)
was used to dissociate GSCs. After washing with PBS,
cells were centrifuged and stained with primary antibody,
followed by incubation with FITC or PE conjugated
secondary antibodies. The cells were then subjected
to flow cytometry analysis on BDAria FACS machine
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and the data was
analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometry antibodies included: anti-human Fcreceptor (Catalog #130-095-979, Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), anti-human CD133/2-PE
(Catalog #130-080-901, Miltenyi Biotec), GFAP (Catalog

PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse mouse (ab6785; Abcam)
secondary antibodies.

Bisulfite sequencing PCR
miR128-1 DNA methylation was evaluated using
Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). CpG islands databases
(www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/cpgplot) were used to identify the
CpG islands (CGIs) spanning the miR128-1 gene. Primers
targeting all three CGIs (sequence number 26, 32 and
72) were designed using Methprimer software. Genomic
DNA isolation and bisulfite conversion were performed
as described previously [35]. Bisulfite-converted genomic
DNA, which converts only unmethylated cytosines to
uracils, was amplified using strand-specific primers
followed by digestion with methylation sensitive enzymes.
The primers used for miR128-1 CGI amplification
were (5’ - 3’): GGTTTTGTTTTTGAGTTGTTGG and
AACAAATATTAACACCTTCATACAACA.
DNA
methylation levels were determined by bisulfite genomic
sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 (Applied Biosystems).

Cell proliferation assay

Animal experiments

2 × 103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Cell
Counting Kit-8 solution (10 μL per well; Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was added and incubated
for additional 4 hrs. Optical density was determined with
a spectrophotometer by measuring the absorption of the
excitation wave at 450 nm and the emission wave at 600
nm (Spectramax 190; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA).

All animal experiments were approved by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Anhui
Provincial Hospital affiliated to Anhui Medical University
(No. LLSC2013014). Athymic/nude immunocompromised
mice were purchased from Nanjing University (Nanjing,
China) and breeding colonies were maintained in our
animal facility under standard conditions. Intracranial
transplantation of glioma cells or GSCs into athymic/nude
immunocompromised mice was performed as previously
described [36]. Briefly, six to eight week old male nude
mice were divided into six groups (five mice per group).
These groups included the control group, miR-NC group
and miR128-1 group for both the U251 and the U251GSCs cell lines. After pre-transplant preparation of the
recipient mice and anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate,
isolated U251-GSCs or U251 cells (106) were transplanted
into the right frontal lobes of the recipient mice to establish
the xenograft model. The weight change of each animal
was measured daily. A miroPET scan was performed on
the tenth day after tumor cell transplantation via tail vein
administration of 18F-FDG or 18F -RGD. The mice were
monitored every day. Cancer cachexia symptoms, such as
weight loss > 20%, limbs paralysis or movement disorder,
lethargy, a hunched posture and growing hair, were set as
the experimental endpoint. When they displayed obvious
cancer cachexia symptoms, the mice were sacrificed, and

Wound healing assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated to
80% confluence. The cell monolayer was gently scraped
with a 10-μL pipette tip and washed three times with
PBS solution and incubated at 37°C. The scraped cell
monolayer was photographed at various time intervals.
Images were acquired using computer-assisted microscopy
and the wound width was measured at various time points.

Cell invasion and migration assays
2.5 × 105 cells suspended in 250 μL serum-free
DMEM were seeded in the top chambers of 24-well
transwell plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) coated
with 30 μL Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The bottom
chambers of the transwell plates were filled with 600
μL DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were allowed to

day 20, all alive U251 and U251-GSCs recipient mouse
brains were harvested for histological analysis. Prior to
harvesting, cardiac perfusion with PBS followed by 4%
PFA perfusion was performed. Brain tumor xenografts
were fixed using 4% PFA overnight, post-fixed in 70%
ethanol, embedded with paraffin and sectioned to 4 μM
for subsequent histological and immunohistochemistry
analysis.
