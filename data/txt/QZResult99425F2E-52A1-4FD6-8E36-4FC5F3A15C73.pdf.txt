Abstract
Knockdown of the tumor suppressor phosphatase Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)
with shRNA in three estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
cancer cell lines resulted in increased phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase (PI3K) and AKT activities, resistance to tamoxifen and
fulvestrant, and hormone-independent growth. PTEN knockdown induced the up-regulation of ER transcriptional activity
in MCF-7 cells but decreased ER protein levels and transcriptional activity in T47D and MDA-361 cells. Tamoxifen and
fulvestrant treatment inhibited estradiol-induced ER transcriptional activity in all shPTEN cell lines but did not
abrogate the increased cell proliferation induced by PTEN
knockdown. PTEN knockdown increased basal and ligandinduced activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)
and ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinases, and prolonged the
association of the p85 PI3K subunit with the IGF-I receptor
(IGF-IR) effector insulin receptor substrate-1 and with ErbB3,
implicating PTEN in the modulation of signaling upstream of
PI3K. Consistent with these data, PTEN levels inversely
correlated with levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-IR in
tissue lysate arrays of primary breast cancers. Inhibition of
IGF-IR and/or ErbB2-mediated activation of ErbB3 with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors restored hormone dependence and
the growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen and fulvestrant on
shPTEN cells, suggesting that cotargeting both ER and
receptor tyrosine kinase pathways holds promise for the
treatment of patients with ER+, PTEN-deficient breast cancers.

Introduction
Loss-of-function mutations of the Phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor
gene occur in 5% to 45% of human cancers (1), with reduced PTEN
protein found in 31% to 48% of breast cancers (2–4). The main
tumor suppressive action of PTEN is its lipid phosphatase activity

to antagonize phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating its product, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
(PIP3), resulting in inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase AKT
and other pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins that
modulate cell growth, survival, and angiogenesis. PTEN can also
act as a protein phosphatase with targets including focal adhesion
kinase (5), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR; ref. 6), and itself (7), and as a
binding partner to increase p53 activity (8).
Two-thirds of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER)-a,
which drives breast cancer cell growth. Although endocrine
therapies designed to block estrogen action (e.g., tamoxifen,
aromatase inhibitors) have changed the natural history of
hormone-dependent breast cancer, many tumors exhibit
de novo or acquired therapeutic resistance. Crosstalk between
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and ER signaling promotes
resistance to endocrine therapy (9). Tumor overexpression of
RTKs and RTK ligands, and increased RTK pathway activation,
have been linked to antiestrogen resistance (10–12). For example,
the RTK effectors AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) can phosphorylate ER (13, 14), and MAPK can
phosphorylate the ER coactivator AIB1, to promote ER transcriptional activity (15). In turn, ER drives transcription of insulin-like
growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), and its
effector insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Activated IRS-1
induces PI3K activation (16) and is stabilized by ER (17).
Furthermore, estrogen induces the expression of genes encoding
the EGFR ligands transforming growth factor a and amphiregulin
(18, 19) and can activate EGFR, HER2/ErbB2, and downstream
signal transducers by transcription-independent mechanisms (20).
Although the traditional role of ER as a transcription factor is
central to ER+ breast cancer, ER has also been implicated in
nongenomic, plasma membrane-initiated signaling with IGF-IR,
EGFR, and PI3K (21, 22).
Mutational activation of the PI3K pathway, by PTEN loss and/or
gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CA (which encodes the PI3K
p110a catalytic subunit), occurs in 56% to 62% of ER+ breast
cancers (23, 24). Patients with cancers exhibiting a gene expression
signature of PTEN loss show poor disease outcome (24). Although
PI3K mutations and PTEN loss are both thought to confer
increased PI3K activity, the cellular effects of these mutations
may be different, as suggested by the coexistence of these
alterations in 5% to 14% of primary breast tumors (2, 23, 24). We
therefore investigated the effects of PTEN loss in three ER+ human

PTEN Loss Confer Antiestrogen Resistance

breast cancer cell lines on PI3K activation, hormone-independent
growth, and response to antiestrogens.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-361 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were stably transduced with retrovirus-encoding shRNA
targeting PTEN or mismatch control (shMM; as in Supplementary Materials
and Methods). Experiments were performed using phenol red–free IMEM +
dextran-charcoal–treated-fetal bovine serum (DCC-FBS; Hyclone) unless
otherwise indicated.
Phospholipid analysis. MCF-7 lines were labeled 16 h with
100 ACi/mL [32P]-Pi (Perkin-Elmer) in phosphate-free DMEM + 10%
dialyzed FBS (Hyclone). Radiolabeled lipids were extracted, concentrated,
and separated by TLC as described (25). 32P incorporation into
phosphatidylinositol species was detected by autoradiography.
Cell proliferations assays. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 12-well
plates (2.5  104 per well). The next day, medium was changed to IMEM +
DCC FBS F 17-h-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-T), fulvestrant
(faslodex; ICI182780; gift from AstraZeneca), testosterone, letrozole (gift
from Dean Evans, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), the allosteric AKT1/2
inhibitor 0360263-1 (AKTi; ref. 26), BEZ235 (27), AEW541 (both provided by
Carlos Garcia-Echeverria, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland; ref. 28), or lapatinib
ditosylate (GW-572016; LC Laboratories). For siRNA of ErbB3/HER3, cells
were transfected as in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Media were
refreshed every 2 to 3 d, and after 5 to 8 d, cells were trypsinized and
counted using a Coulter counter.
ER transcriptional reporter assays. Cells were plated as above and
transfected with pGLB-MERE (provided by Dorraya El-Ashry, University of
Miami, Miami, FL) and pCMV-Renilla (Promega) luciferase plasmids. Cells
were then treated as above, and luciferase activity was measured 16 to
20 h later as described (29).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were treated as
indicated (IGF-I and heregulin-h1; R&D Systems). Cells were lysed in NP40
buffer plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors, sonicated for 10 s,

centrifuged at 14k rpm for 10 min., and protein was quantitated using BCA
assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using Dynal proteinG beads (Invitrogen) and p85 antibody (Upstate) as described (30).
Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose. Primary antibodies for immunoblotting
included PTEN, IGF-IRh, HER3, ERa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AKT,
P-AKTS473, P-HER2Y1248, P-HER3Y1289, P-IGF-IRhY1131 (Cell Signaling), PR
(Dako), P-tyrosine (4G10, Vanderbilt Monoclonal Antibody Core), IRS-1
(Upstate), and actin (Sigma). Phospho-RTK arrays were performed as per
manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems).
Reverse phase protein lysate microarray analysis. Three hundred and
eighty-three hormone receptor–positive, primary breast tumor samples
were obtained from the Breast Tissue Frozen Tumor Bank at M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. Specimens were collected under Institutional
Review Board–approved protocols. Tumor lysates were analyzed as in
Supplementary Materials and Methods (31) using antibodies against PTEN,
P-IGF-IRhY1135/1136 (may cross-react with P-InsRhY1150/1151), and IGF-IRh.
Relative protein levels were quantified, and PTEN scores were plotted
against P-IGF-IRh/IGF-IRh ratio.
Statistical analysis. In cell proliferation assays and ER transcriptional
reporter assays, significant differences were determined by two-tailed t test.
In reverse phase protein lysate microarray analysis, relative units for PTEN,
P-IGF-IRh, and IGF-IRh levels were converted to logarithms, and the
relationship between PTEN and ratio of P-IGF-IRh/IGF-IRh was analyzed
using two-tailed t test and Pearson correlation. P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
PTEN loss results in hormone-independent growth and
antiestrogen resistance. We stably knocked down PTEN in
MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-361 ER+ breast cancer cells using shMM.
In shPTEN cell lines, PTEN protein was undetectable and AKT
phosphorylation at Ser473 (P-AKT) was up-regulated compared
with shMM controls (Fig. 1A). All three of these cell lines harbor

containing DCC-FBS (MCF-7, 2%; T47D and MDA-361,

immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. PR was not
detected in MDA-361 cells. B, MCF-7 lines were
metabolically labeled with 32P-orthophosphatase in 10%
dialyzed FBS 16 h. Lipids were extracted, resolved by
TLC, and 32P-PIP species were detected by
autoradiography (arrows ). Origin of spotting is indicated.
Cell lysates were also used for immunoblotting to confirm
PTEN status. Fold changes in PR isoforms (A) and PIP3
(B) normalized to actin were determined by densitometry
analysis (bar graphs ).

PTEN Loss Confer Antiestrogen Resistance

Figure 3. PTEN loss activates RTKs
upstream of PI3K. A, lysates from
MCF-7 (i), T47D (ii), and MDA-361
(iii) lines treated with medium containing
DCC-FBS (MCF-7, 2%; T47D and

probe phospho-RTK arrays. Antibodies
against 42 RTKs are spotted in duplicate on
a membrane. Membranes are incubated
with cell lysates followed by probing
with a P-tyrosine antibody. A positive
signal is indicative of receptor
phosphorylation. Blots from each pair
of lines are exposure-matched.
Tyrosine-phosphorylated RTKs are labeled
as follows: 1, EGFR; 2, HER2; 3, HER3;
4, InsRh; 5, IGF-IRh; 6, ErbB4; 7, ROR2;
8, EphA1. Positive controls are spotted at
corners. B, lysates from MCF-7 (i), T47D (ii),
and MDA-361 (iii) lines treated as in A
overnight F the indicated kinase inhibitors
were used for immunoblotting with the
indicated antibodies. Short and long
exposures (exp) are shown in iii. C, tumor
lysates from 383 hormone receptor-positive
breast cancers were analyzed by reverse
phase protein lysate microarray analysis
to quantify relative levels of PTEN,
P-IGF-IRhY1135/1136, and IGF-IRh. Shown is
a scatterplot of PTEN versus ratio of
P-IGF-IRh/IGF-IRh (indicative of the fraction
of activated IGF-IRh). This relationship
was analyzed using two-tailed t test and
Pearson correlation.

MCF-7/shPTEN cells formed palpable tumors (z3 mm in diameter)
versus only 1 of 5 animals injected with MCF-7/shMM cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Although all lines were sensitive to the
inhibitory effects of the selective ER modulator 4-OH-T and the
ER down-regulator fulvestrant, shPTEN cells exhibited significantly increased growth compared with shMM controls (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2A), indicative of relative antiestrogen resistance. The hormoneindependent proliferation of MDA-361/shMM cells, but not
MDA-361/shPTEN cells, was inhibited by 4-OH-T and fulvestrant.
Furthermore, testosterone induced the growth of MCF-7/shPTEN
but not MCF-7/shMM cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A, iv). This response was
blocked by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, suggesting that PTEN
knockdown up-regulated the cellular response to E2 produced by the
aromatization of testosterone. Aromatase mRNA levels were unchanged by PTEN knockdown (determined by microarray analysis;
data not shown). Aromatase protein was undetectable by immuno-

blot analysis of MCF-7 lines, but low levels of aromatase are expressed in MCF-7 cells (32).
PI3K/AKT pathway activation has been associated with
increased ER transcriptional activity and reduced ER expression
in MCF-7 cells (14, 33). Here, MCF-7/shPTEN cells showed
increased basal, E2-induced, and testosterone-induced ER
transcriptional reporter activity compared with shMM cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 2B, i and iv). However, PTEN loss
decreased basal and E2-stimulated ER transcriptional activity in
T47D and MDA-361 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 2B, ii and iii),
reflective of the reduced ER levels in these cells (Fig. 1). We also
observed variable effects of PTEN loss on the expression of the
E2-inducible genes AREG and EGR3 (18). In MCF-7 and T47D cells,
PTEN knockdown increased the basal and E2-induced mRNA levels
of AREG and EGR3 compared with shMM controls (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Opposite effects were observed in MDA-361 cells.

Treatment with 4-OH-T or fulvestrant did not consistently
suppress the effects of PTEN knockdown on AREG or EGR3
expression, suggesting that PTEN loss alters their expression by
both ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanisms. Although
treatment with 4-OH-T, fulvestrant, or letrozole did not abrogate
the growth advantage of shPTEN cell lines (Fig. 2A), these
inhibitors markedly suppressed E2- and testosterone-induced ER
transcriptional activity in all lines (Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 2B).
Overall, these data suggest that the increased hormone-independent growth and relative resistance to 4-OH-T and fulvestrant
conferred by PTEN loss cannot be solely explained by increased
ER transcriptional activity.
PTEN loss increases IGF-IR– and ErbB3-mediated activation
of PI3K. We next examined mechanisms that can activate PI3K in
PTEN-deficient cells. Using phospho-RTK array analysis, we
detected predominant tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IRh,
ErbB3/HER3, insulin receptor-h (InsRh), and EGFR in MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 3A, i), and of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in T47D and MDA-361
cells (Fig. 3A, ii and iii). PTEN loss up-regulated tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFR, InsRh, and IGF-IRh in MCF-7 cells,
and of EGFR, HER3, ErbB4/HER4, and ROR2 in T47D cells. We next
used a loss-of-function approach to assess which RTKs activated
PI3K, measuring P-AKTS473 as a surrogate of PI3K activity. The
IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEW541 reduced P-AKT in MCF-7
cells (Fig. 3B, i), whereas the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor
lapatinib reduced P-AKT in T47D and MDA-361 cells (Fig. 3B, ii and
iii). Treatment with lapatinib decreased P-HER3 in all three cell

lines (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that HER3 activation is
EGFR/HER2-dependent in these cells, and that HER3 is the
predominant activator of PI3K in T47D and MDA-361 cells. In all
shPTEN lines, the combination of AEW541 plus lapatinib inhibited
P-AKT more effectively than either drug alone. AKTi and the PI3K/
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor BEZ235 decreased PAKT in all lines.
To ascertain whether PTEN loss is linked with IGF-IR activation
in primary breast cancers, we analyzed 383 hormone receptor–
positive tumors by reverse phase protein lysate microarray for
levels of PTEN, tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-IRh (P-IGF-IRh), and
total IGF-IRh. We observed a statistically significant inverse
correlation between PTEN levels and P-IGF-IRh/IGF-IRh ratio
(R2 = 0.182; P < 10 15; Fig. 3C), consistent with the results observed
upon PTEN knockdown in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). Because P-IGFIRh antibodies may cross-react with P-InsRh, we cannot rule out
that P-InsRh may also contribute to this correlation.
Growth factor receptors activate PI3K by phosphorylating
adaptor proteins such as GAB1, GAB2, IRS-1, IRS-2, and HER3.
Tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptors engage the N-SH2 domain
of the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, relieving the inhibition of the
p110 catalytic subunit by p85, and recruiting the p85-p110
heterodimer to its substrate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
at the plasma membrane (34). p110 phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to produce PIP3. The interaction between p85 and tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptors permits the
identification of PI3K activators by their coprecipitation with p85

antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of p85 followed by immunoblot
analysis showed increased p85-IRS-1 binding under basal and
serum-stimulated conditions in MCF-7/shPTEN cells compared
with shMM control (Fig. 4A). Similarly, T47D/shPTEN cells showed
increased p85-HER3 association compared with shMM cells. PTEN
loss did not significantly alter the high basal p85-HER3 association
in MDA-361 cells. Additionally, MCF-7/shPTEN cells showed
increased PI3K/AKT pathway sensitivity to IGF-I ligand compared
with shMM control (Fig. 4B, i). In contrast, PTEN loss maximally
activated PI3K under basal conditions in T47D and MDA-361 cells,
whereas shMM cells showed increased P-AKT upon stimulation
with serum or the HER3 ligand heregulin-h1 (Fig. 4B, ii and iii).
A time course in IGF-I–stimulated MCF-7 cell lines showed that

www.aacrjournals.org

the association of p85 with IRS-1 upon ligand addition was
enhanced by PTEN loss (Fig. 5A). P-IGF-IRh was detectable after
5 min. of IGF-I stimulation and returned to baseline within 1 hour
in MCF-7/shMM cells. In contrast, P-IGF-IRh and the increased
p85-IRS-1 association remained detectable for z3 hours after IGF-I
stimulation in MCF-7/shPTEN cells. Therefore, PTEN loss
increased and prolonged the activation of IGF-IR and IRS-1. Prior
work has shown that PI3K pathway activation suppresses IRS-1
expression (35). Indeed, extended IGF-I stimulation for 24 hours
modestly decreased IRS-1 levels in MCF-7/shPTEN but not MCF-7/
shMM cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, PTEN loss may
promote IRS-1 down-regulation due to increased negative feedback
from PI3K signaling.

Additionally, we detected IGF-I–induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 (Fig. 5A), suggestive of crosstalk between IGF-IR
and ErbB receptors. This phosphorylation was more robust and
sustained in MCF-7/shPTEN compared with MCF-7/shMM cells
and was inhibited by AEW541. IGF-I–induced activation of IGF-IR,
HER3, and AKT was inhibited by either AEW541 or lapatinib,
suggesting that EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase activity was required
for HER3 activation in response to IGF-I (Supplementary Fig. S7;
Fig. 5B).
PTEN loss induced maximal activation of PI3K/AKT in T47D
cells (Fig. 4B). Lapatinib inhibited PI3K in these cells, suggesting
that PI3K activation was EGFR/HER2/HER3 dependent (Supplementary Fig. S5; Figs. 3A–B and 4A). Therefore, we examined
the temporal effect of lapatinib on HER3 inactivation and p85HER3 interaction. T47D/shPTEN cells exhibited constitutive
association between p85 and HER3, and higher levels of P-HER3
and P-AKT compared with shMM control (Supplementary Fig. S7;
Fig. 5C). In T47D/shPTEN cells, p85-HER3 association, P-HER3,
and P-AKT remained detectable after overnight treatment with
lapatinib, compared with near-complete inhibition after 2 to
3 hours in T47D/shMM cells. These data suggest that, like for

IGF-IR, PTEN knockdown increases and prolongs the activation of
HER3 and PI3K. PTEN loss did not alter the ability of lapatinib to
suppress P-HER3 and p85-HER3 association in MDA-361 cells
(not shown).
PTEN loss increases nongenomic estrogen signaling through
IGF-IR. Nongenomic estrogen signaling to activate PI3K and
MAPK has been proposed as a mechanism of resistance to
hormonal therapy (22). We found that PTEN loss enhances an
E2-induced increase in P-AKT and p85–IRS-1 interaction in MCF-7
cells (Fig. 5D). This signaling was unaffected by pretreatment with
4-OH-T or fulvestrant, although these compounds respectively
increased and decreased ER protein levels. AEW541 but not
lapatinib blocked p85-IRS-1 binding and P-AKT, suggesting that
IGF-IR permits E2-induced PI3K activation in these cells. E2 did
not increase P-AKT in T47D or MDA-361 cells (data not shown).
Combined blockade of IGF-IR and ErbB signaling inhibits
PTEN-deficient cell growth. Treatment with AKTi, BEZ235, or
AEW541 inhibited the growth of MCF-7/shPTEN cells in hormonedepleted medium and in the presence of tamoxifen or fulvestrant
(Fig. 6A). In contrast, lapatinib was effective mainly when
combined with 4-OH-T or fulvestrant. MCF-7/shPTEN cells showed

PTEN Loss Confer Antiestrogen Resistance

increased sensitivity to AEW541 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002
compared with shMM control (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting
that PTEN loss increases dependence upon IGF-IR and PI3K.
Similarly, AKTi, BEZ235, and lapatinib significantly inhibited T47D/
shPTEN (Fig. 6B) and MDA-361/shPTEN (Fig. 6C) cell growth. In
these cells, AEW541 was only effective when combined with 4-OHT or fulvestrant.
In all shPTEN lines, the combination of AEW541 plus lapatinib
was significantly more inhibitory than either agent alone (Fig. 6).
These results imply that in MCF-7 cells, IGF-IR mainly drives PI3K/
AKT (Figs. 3–5), but EGFR/HER2/HER3 may also contribute
to hormone-independent growth and antiestrogen resistance
(Fig. 6A). Indeed, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HER3 (verified
in Supplementary Fig. S8) inhibited the growth of MCF-7/shPTEN
and/shMM cells in hormone-depleted medium, and sensitized
them to 4-OH-T and fulvestrant (Fig. 6D). The inhibitory effect of
HER3 knockdown was augmented by AEW541 treatment, implicating both HER3 and IGF-IR in the modulation of MCF-7/shPTEN
cell growth. Similarly, HER3 drives PI3K in T47D and MDA-361 cells
(Figs. 3–5), but the synergistic effect of lapatinib plus AEW541 also
implicates IGF-IR in the modulation of growth of T47D/shPTEN
and MDA-361/shPTEN cells (Fig. 6B–C). Because these kinase
inhibitors synergized with 4-OH-T, fulvestrant, and hormonedeprivation to block cell growth, PTEN-deficient, ER+ breast
cancer patients may be effectively treated with drug combinations
targeting ER and RTK pathways that activate PI3K.

Discussion
Herein, we show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of PTEN in
three ER+ breast cancer cell lines resulted in antiestrogen
resistance and hormone-independent growth by both genomic
and nongenomic mechanisms. PTEN loss up-regulated PI3K/AKT
and enhanced IGF-IR/IRS-1 and HER3 signaling, implicating PTEN
in the modulation of RTK signaling upstream of PI3K. Notably, all
cell lines used herein harbor activating mutations in PIK3CA, the
gene encoding p110a (2). These results suggest that (a) different
signaling outputs result from PTEN loss versus PIK3CA mutations,
and (b) PTEN loss is a more transforming event than PIK3CA
mutations. This is consistent with reports that PIK3CA mutations
and PTEN loss coexist in 5% to 14% of primary breast cancers
(2, 23, 24). Cross-talk between IGF-IR and EGFR/HER2 was also
enhanced by PTEN loss, as IGF-I–induced HER3 phosphorylation
was inhibited by lapatinib (Supplementary Fig. S7; Fig. 5B).
Combined inhibition of these RTKs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
and/or RNAi most effectively inhibited PI3K activation (Fig. 3B)
and cell growth (Fig. 6).
The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN mediates its tumor
suppressive function through dephosphorylation of PIP3. However,
evidence also suggests a tumor suppressor role for PTEN protein
phosphatase activity. First, a PTENG129E mutation was found in two
kindreds of Cowden’s disease, a cancer predisposition disorder.
PTENG129E lacks lipid phosphatase activity but retains protein
phosphatase activity (36), inhibits cell migration (5) and epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (37), and promotes G1 cell cycle arrest
(38). Second, we found that PTEN loss dysregulates kinase
signaling upstream of PI3K. PTEN directly modulates tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (6), and regulates IRS-1 activation and InsR-IRS-1 binding
(39). We showed that PTEN loss increases and prolongs IGF-IR and
HER3 tyrosine-phosphorylation, p85-IRS-1 and p85-HER3 binding,

www.aacrjournals.org

and E2-induced, IGF-IR/IRS-1–dependent activation of PI3K/AKT
(Supplementary Fig. S7; Figs. 3–5). Furthermore, PTEN levels were
inversely correlated with P-IGF-IRh in hormone receptor–positive
breast cancers (Fig. 3C).
These findings collectively suggest that PTEN modulates
RTKs and adaptors that activate PI3K, implicating PTEN in
regulatory processes both upstream and downstream of PI3K.
Because PTEN loss increases RTK activation and sensitivity to RTK
ligands (Figs. 3–5), we speculate that other RTK-initiated signaling
pathways besides PI3K are likely to also be activated in PTENdeficient cells. Although the mechanism(s) by which PTEN
regulates IGF-IR and HER3 remains unclear, possibilities include
genomic effects, feedback signaling to RTKs or their adaptors (39),
modulation of RTK ligand production, or PTEN binding and/or
dephosphorylation of RTKs or adaptor proteins such as focal
adhesion kinase (5). Notably, focal adhesion kinase is a PTEN
substrate (5), and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation has
been implicated in IGF-IR (40), HER2/HER3 (41, 42), EGFR, and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling (43). To explore
changes in RTK ligand production upon PTEN loss in MCF-7 cells,
we used reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA assays for IGF-I
and IGF-II, but we found no change in mRNA or protein levels
(data not shown).
We show that IGF-IR/ErbB cross-talk is enhanced by PTEN loss.
IGF-I stimulation increased P-HER3 in direct correlation with
P-IGF-IRh, and these effects were prolonged in PTEN-deficient
cells (Fig. 5A). These responses were blocked by lapatinib or
AEW541 (Supplementary Fig. S7; Fig. 5B), suggesting that IGF-IR
and EGFR/HER2 kinases were required. IGF-IR has been shown to
complex with P-HER2 upon stimulation with IGF-I or heregulin
(44). IGF-IR has also been shown to activate EGFR (45).
Interestingly, lapatinib suppressed IGF-I–induced IGF-IR phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S7; Fig. 5B), suggesting that EGFR
and/or HER2 kinases are also permissive of IGF-IR activation. This
RTK cross-talk supports the synergistic inhibitory effect of AEW541
plus either lapatinib or HER3 knockdown on shPTEN cell growth
(Fig. 6) and PI3K activation (Fig. 3B). We speculate that PTENdeficient cancer cells use an alternative RTK pathway(s) to drive
growth and survival when the primary PI3K-activating RTK is
blocked. Dissecting the roles of IGF-IR and ErbB RTKs in
heteromeric complex formation, stability, and signaling requires
further evaluation, but these data suggest that inhibition of one
RTK type (EGFR/HER2) may disrupt signaling of another RTK type
(IGF-IR), and that combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
should be considered for the treatment of PTEN-deficient cancers.
Breast cancer cells may maintain a balance between ER and RTK
pathways. Upon treatment with 4-OH-T or hormone deprivation,
breast cancer cells adapt by up-regulating RTK network components (e.g., P-AKT, P-MAPK, RTK ligands; ref. 46). In turn, RTK
pathway activation modulates ER function. For example, activation
of the Src tyrosine kinase can induce ER degradation (47). Prior
findings with MCF-7 cells suggest that PI3K activation suppresses
ER expression while increasing transcriptional activity (14, 33).
However, we found that PTEN loss decreased both ER protein
levels and transcriptional activity in T47D and MDA-361 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 1A and 2B), indicating that the
increase in ER transcriptional activity observed upon PTEN loss in
MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 2B) is not widely
applicable to all hormone-dependent breast cancers. The decreased
levels of PR seen upon PTEN knockdown in MCF-7 and T47D cells
(Fig. 1A) may be due to increased PR degradation or decreased

gene expression (determined by microarray analysis; data not
shown). PI3K pathway activation has been shown to increase the
expression of the E2-inducible gene Cyclin D1 while suppressing
PgR expression (48). Furthermore, heregulin-h1 stimulation of
T47D cells increased PR phosphorylation at Ser294 (49), which, in
turn, promotes PR degradation (50). Therefore, PI3K activation as a
result of PTEN loss may up-regulate or down-regulate transcription
of ER target genes, as well as modulate their gene products
posttranslationally.
In summary, we report that induced PTEN loss in hormonedependent human breast cancer cells resulted in (a) hormoneindependent growth and resistance to 4-OH-T and fulvestrant,
(b) variable alterations in ER transcriptional activity, and (c)
up-regulation of kinase signaling upstream and downstream of
PI3K. Furthermore, we showed that PTEN knockdown in three
PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer cell lines confers gain-of-function
effects, indicating different signaling outputs as a result of PTEN
loss versus PIK3CA mutation. The use of three cell lines allowed
us to discover pathways commonly dysregulated by PTEN loss
in different systems, and we found that PTEN loss up-regulates
intact pathways upstream of PI3K. Inhibition of IGF-IR and ErbB
signaling synergized with 4-OH-T, fulvestrant, and hormone-
