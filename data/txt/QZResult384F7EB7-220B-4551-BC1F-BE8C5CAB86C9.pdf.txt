Abstract
Smac mimetic compounds (SMC) are novel small molecules
being developed for cancer therapy. The mechanism of
SMC-induced sensitivity in cancer cells depends on autocrine
release of tumor necrosis factor A (TNFA); however, potential
mechanisms of resistance remain unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular profile and cytotoxic responsiveness of
a diverse panel of 51 cancer cell lines to combinations of a
dimeric SMC (AEG40730), death ligand TNFA, and tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Synergy
was seen in combination with death receptor agonists in
some cells, although single-agent activity was limited to a
few sensitive lines. Unexpectedly, the majority of cell lines
resistant to combinations of SMC-AEG40730 and death ligands
expressed caspase-8, FADD, RIP1, and ligand receptors necessary for apoptosis execution. Furthermore, TNFA-mediated
ubiquitination of RIP1 was repressed by SMC-AEG40730 treatment, leading to the formation of the proapoptosis complex II.
However, in resistant cancer cells, SMC-AEG40730 repressed
TNFA-mediated c-jun-NH2-kinase activation and the levels of
caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP were persistently elevated, in contrast to SMC-responsive cancer cells. Importantly, the silencing of c-FLIP restored SMC sensitivity in previously resistant
cancer cells by allowing ligand-mediated activation of
caspase-8 and caspase-3 to proceed. Together, these results
provide mechanistic insight into the action of SMCs, demonstrating that the deciphering of the relevant molecular
signature in cancer cells leads to the prediction of cancer cell
responsiveness to SMC treatment. Furthermore, a majority of
resistant cancer cells were sensitized to SMC-AEG40730 and
TNFA by down-regulating c-FLIP, suggesting novel approaches
in the use of SMCs and c-FLIP antagonists in treating cancer.

Introduction
Smac mimetic compounds (SMC) are a class of small-molecule
therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer (1). The targets of
SMC are the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins that include
cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, all of which possess three baculoviral
IAP repeat (BIR) domains and a ubiquitin E3 ligase RING domain.
The divergent structures of SMCs originate from the conserved
AVPI tetrapeptide NH2-terminal sequence of Smac that binds to
the BIR domains of IAPs. When this feature was incorporated into

a dimeric format, remarkable increases in binding potency
were seen (2).
A common mode of action of SMCs involves the rapid activation
of the ubiquitin E3 ligase of cIAP1 and cIAP2, which leads
to autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of these cIAPs
(3–8). The loss of cIAPs allows the accumulation of their substrate
NIK, an activator of the alternative NF-nB pathway (5, 9). In
parallel, the absence of cIAPs facilitates the recruitment of RIP1 to
the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), promoting the
activation of the classic NF-nB pathway (4). The induction of these
NF-nB pathways leads to TNFa production. However, with cIAPs
depleted, TNFa cannot promote RIP1 ubiquitination (3, 10, 11),
and, as a consequence, RIP1 is released from the TNF-R1 complex.
Subsequently, the death-inducing complex II containing RIP1,
FADD, and caspase-8 is formed, activating the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway (12).
Similar to complex II, a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
that contains TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 can also promote
apoptosis. The activation of DISC requires the down-regulation
of c-FLIP, an enzymatically dead caspase-8 homologue that
competes for caspase-8 binding to FADD (13, 14). The downregulation of c-FLIP can be achieved through c-jun-NH2-kinase
(JNK)–mediated activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
(15). Alternatively, c-FLIP can also be silenced by inhibiting the
NF-nB signaling pathway. Paradoxically, the inhibitory role of
c-FLIP toward caspase-8 is in conflict to the current model of
SMC mode of action, which suggests that endogenous c-FLIP
does not block complex II–mediated caspase-8 activation in
SMC-sensitive cells (12).
In spite of the potential of this novel class of therapeutics, SMCs
as single agents are effective only in a small percentage of cancer
cell lines tested to date, with enhanced activity being seen in the
presence of an apoptotic trigger engaging the extrinsic death
receptor pathway (16). As part of the immune surveillance system,
death receptor ligands such as TNFa and tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are expressed by immune
cells that can eliminate cancerous cells by triggering extrinsic
apoptosis through the death receptors expressed on cancer cells
(17, 18). In the presence of either TNFa or TRAIL, apoptosis induction by SMCs is promoted synergistically (2). The extent of synergy,
however, has not been extensively tested. Moreover, as most cancer
cell lines are refractory to SMC-mediated apoptosis, delineating the
molecular basis for resistance to TNFa and TRAIL may also facilitate the identification of complementary therapeutic strategies as
apoptotic triggers for SMCs.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of SMC resistance
using a prototypic SMC of the dimeric class, AEG40730, which displays potent low nanomolar binding to the BIR3 domains of XIAP,
cIAP1, and cIAP2 (3). In common with other SMCs, AEG40730 causes
ubiquitin-mediated loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2; however, AEG40730,
as well as SM-164, also induces the loss of XIAP when higher

concentrations are used at longer exposure periods (3–5, 7). We
analyzed a diverse panel of cancer cell lines for their cytotoxic
responsiveness to SMC-AEG40730, TNFa, and TRAIL. We show that
in this panel, a majority of cancer cell lines are resistant to SMCAEG40730 alone, but about half of the panel is responsive when
cotreated with TNFa or TRAIL. Interestingly, components of the

machinery necessary for TNFa- or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis seem
to be present in most of the SMC-resistant cancer cells. Intriguingly, in resistant cancer cells, SMC-AEG40730 represses the TNFamediated activation of JNK and the level of c-FLIP persists. The
knockdown of c-FLIP restores the ability of SMC-AEG40730 to promote apoptosis in these formerly resistant cancer cells, demonstrating

that endogenous c-FLIP blocks SMC-induced caspase-8 activation.
Therefore, to the extent that SMC-AEG40730 is representative of
the mechanism of SMC-induced killing, the molecular profiling
of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway predicts SMC responsiveness
in cancer cells. Moreover, suppression of c-FLIP expression, in
combination with SMC treatment, warrants further investigation
as it has the potential of increasing the scope and efficacy of
this experimental cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. SMC AEG40730 as previously described (3) was synthesized
by Vibrant Pharma, Inc. Recombinant human TNFa and soluble TRAIL
were obtained from BIOMOL International.
Transfection of small interfering RNA. Annealed double-stranded
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) for c-FLIP
(GUGCCGGGAUGUUGCUAUA, CAAGCAGUCUGUUCAAGGA, CAUG-

GUAUAUCCCAGAUUC, CCUAGGAAUCUGCCUGAUA) and nontargeting
Accell SMARTpool were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were forward
or reversed transfected at the indicated concentration for each siRNA
using DharmaFECT I reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Protein preparation and immunoprecipitation. Protein samples were
prepared as described before (19). Protein content was determined by
Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For
endogenous caspase-8 immunoprecipitation, f1  107 cells were washed
twice with PBS and lysed in a buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol on ice
for 15 min. Endogenous caspase-8 complex was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4jC with 4 Ag anti–caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
complexes were recovered with 40 AL Protein G-agarose. For endogenous
TNF-R1 complex immunoprecipitation, f1  107 cells were washed twice
with PBS and lysed in a buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing
0.2% NP10, 10% glycerol and 150 mmol/L NaCl] on ice for 15 min. The TNFR1 complex was immunoprecipitated (anti–TNF-R1, R&D Systems) overnight at 4jC with 1 Ag of antibody, and complexes were recovered with

Results
The majority of cancer cell lines are resistant to the
SMC AEG40730 as a single agent. We initially tested SMCAEG40730 on a known responsive breast carcinoma cell line,
MDA-MB-231, and four previously untested neuroblastoma cell

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

lines, Lan-1, Lan-5, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-BE(2). Although MDA-MB231 cells responded robustly to SMC-AEG40730 with an IC50 of
1.32 nmol/L, the four neuroblastoma cell lines failed to respond
to SMC-AEG40730 even at 2 Amol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1).
From these initial analyses, we chose 100 nmol/L as the standard
SMC-AEG40730 concentration for subsequent investigations.
Our preliminary findings suggested that there might be a
wide range of SMC-AEG40730 responsiveness in a spectrum
of cancer cells. In addition to standalone efficacy, SMCs also
potently synergize with TNFa and TRAIL (2, 3). We therefore
screened a diverse panel of cancer cells, including glioblastomas,
lung, neuroblastoma, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer cell
lines, for a measure of cytotoxic responsiveness at 24 hours
to fixed dose combinations of SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa or

examined, 4% were sensitive (viability <50%), 6% were intermediate
responders (viability 50–75%), and 90% were resistant (viability

the cell lines examined was sensitive to TNFa alone, and 20%

were sensitive to TRAIL (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). When cell
lines were treated with the combination of SMC-AEG40730
and TNFa, or TRAIL, the sensitive populations increased to 48%
and 55%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2D and E). TNFa and
TRAIL are triggers for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and,

as expected, cell lines that were responsive to cotreatment of
SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa also tended to respond to SMCAEG40730 in the presence of TRAIL. As such, 22 of the 24 cell
lines that were sensitized by SMC-AEG40730 to exogenous TNFa
were likewise susceptible to TRAIL addition. The overall results
were tabulated and are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Our
findings indicate that the majority of cancer cell lines across
the spectrum are refractory to SMC-AEG40730 treatment, and
about half are sensitive when an extrinsic apoptotic pathway
trigger is added.
Core components of the TNFA- and TRAIL-mediated
apoptotic pathway are present in the majority of SMCAEG40730–resistant cancer cell lines examined. The unresponsiveness of certain cancer cell lines to SMC-AEG40730, even in

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

the presence of an extrinsic apoptotic trigger, prompted us
to investigate the basis of this resistance. The execution of
TNFa-mediated apoptosis requires RIP1 or TRADD, whereas both
TNFa- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis require their respective
receptors (i.e., TNF-RI and DR5) as well as caspase-8 and FADD. We
therefore profiled the entire panel of the 51 cancer cell lines for the
presence of these components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Remarkably, the apoptotic machinery was present in the vast
majority of the cell lines (86%), with the notable exception of six
neuroblastoma cell lines and the H520 non–small cell lung
carcinoma that lacked critical components such as caspase-8,
TNF-RI, or DR5 (Fig. 1A–C). The targets of SMC, specifically
cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, were present in the entire panel
investigated. No correlation was found between the levels of

the IAPs in these cell lines and their responsiveness to SMCAEG40730. As perhaps expected, these cell lines that were missing
components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway were also among
those that are the most resistant to SMC-AEG40730 and relevant
ligand triggers. Notwithstanding this finding, about a third of all
the cell lines examined were resistant to SMC-AEG40730 and death
ligand triggers but still possessed core components of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway. Therefore, lesions in the apoptotic pathway
explained SMC unresponsiveness in some cell lines, but the basis of
resistance for most others remained unresolved.
SMC-AEG40730 blocks TNFA-mediated ubiquitination of
RIP1 and delays TNFA-mediated NF-KB signaling in resistant
cell lines. A consequence of cIAP1/2 removal is the reduction of

RIP1 ubiquitination in response to TNFa (3, 10, 11). In cancer cells
that are sensitive to SMC, the lack of RIP1 ubiquitination allows
for the release of RIP1 from TNF-R1 to activate caspase-8 in the
death complex II (3, 12). The status of TNFa-mediated ubiquitination of RIP1 in resistant and intermediately sensitive cancer
cells after SMC treatment, however, is not known. Therefore, we
next analyzed the ubiquitination of RIP1 in three SMC-resistant
cell lines (ovarian carcinoma A2780-CP, lung carcinoma A549, and
glioblastoma U343), after exposure to SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa.
We immunoprecipitated the TNF-R1 complex and then probed for
its constituents. Exposure to TNFa alone led to the accumulation
of ubiquitinated RIP1 in the TNF-R1 complex (Fig. 2A and data not
shown). The ablation of cIAPs by SMC-AEG40730 diminished

Figure 6. Endogenous c-FLIP protects resistant cancer cells from SMC AEG40730-mediated cell death. A2780-CP (A) and U343 (B) cells were transfected with
siRNA against a c-FLIP or a nontargeting (NT) siRNA as a control. At 24 h after siRNA-mediated silencing, these cells were exposed to combinations of 100 nmol/L
SMC-AEG40730, 100 ng/mL TNFa, or TRAIL for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and immunoblotted for caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and
XIAP. For the probing of cleaved caspase-8, higher laser intensity was used to detect the IR fluorescent signals. h-Actin was used as a loading control. The absence
of c-FLIP facilitated the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in response to SMC-AEG40730 and death receptor ligands. A2780-CP (C) and U343 (D) cells were silenced
with c-FLIP and then exposed to the combinations of SMC-AEG40730, TNFa, and TRAIL. After 24 h (A2780-CP) or 48 h (U343) of drug exposure, cell viability was determined
by trypan blue exclusion for A2780-CP cells and Alamar blue for U343 cells. Percentage viability relative to nontargeting RNAi and vehicle F SD (n = 4) was plotted. The downregulation of c-FLIP reversed the resistance of these cells to the cotreatment of SMC-AEG40730 and death receptor ligands.

ubiquitination of RIP1 at the TNF-R1 complex (Fig. 2A and data
not shown), consistent with the finding that cIAPs are the ubiquitin
E3 ligases for RIP1. To confirm whether the SMC-induced loss of
ubiquitination of RIP1 indeed enhanced the formation of complex
II containing RIP1 and caspase-8, we immunoprecipitated caspase8 following SMC-AEG40730 treatment. We found that following
exposure to SMC-AEG40730, caspase-8 increased its association
with RIP1 (Fig. 2B and C). These results show that in cancer cells
that are resistant to SMC and TNFa, SMC treatment still represses
the ubiquitination of RIP1.
Activation of NF-nB can affect the survival of cancer cells (21). In
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), the loss of cIAPs reduced the
ubiquitination of RIP1, which blunted the activation of TNFamediated classic NF-nB pathway and sensitizes cells to apoptosis
(10, 11). Given that we found in resistant cancer cells that SMCAEG40730 has the ability to knock down cIAPs, but that reduced
ubiquitination of RIP1 still occurs (Fig. 2A and data not shown), we
further examined the effect of SMC on TNFa-mediated classic NFnB pathway. We measured the activation of NF-nB by the
degradation of InBa, in both SMC-resistant cell lines as well as
in the highly responsive pancreatic Panc1 cells to the cotreatment
of SMC and TNFa (5% viability; Supplementary Fig. S2D). SMC
treatment blunted the activation of the TNFa-mediated classic
NF-nB pathway in U343, A2780-CP, and GI-ME-N cells (Fig. 2D;
Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). In A549 and Panc1 cells, SMCAEG40730 pretreatment modestly delayed TNFa-mediated activation of the classic NF-nB pathway (Supplementary Fig. S3C and D).
Although SMC-AEG40730 pretreatment delayed or blunted the
activation of the classic NF-nB pathway, the extent of the signal
reduction does not seem to correlate with loss of cell viability. This
finding in cancer cells is in marked contrast to the robust
suppression of TNFa-mediated classic NF-nB activation and
sensitization to TNFa-mediated cell death in MEFs deficient of
cIAP1 and cIAP2 (10, 11). Overall, these results indicate that the
degree of blunting of the classic NF-nB pathway following TNFa
addition is not a unique predictor for the efficacy of SMC in killing
cancer cells.
c-FLIP is not decreased in response to SMC-AEG40730 and
death receptor ligands in resistant cell lines. To further
investigate the underlying basis for SMC-resistance, we analyzed
the effects of SMC-AEG40730, TNFa, and TRAIL on the expression
profile of pathway-associated proteins. We first confirmed the
ability of SMC-AEG40730 to reduce the levels of cIAP1, cIAP2, and
XIAP (Fig. 3A). The level of full-length caspase-8 remained constant
in the resistant cell lines examined following the cotreatment of
SMC-AEG40730 and TRAIL (Fig. 3B). A decrease in full-length
caspase-8 seen in GI-ME-N is indicative of processing and
activation of caspase-8, consistent with GI-ME-N cells showing
a response to the cotreatment of SMC-AEG40730 and TRAIL
(Fig. 3B). Following TNFa treatment, the levels of TRADD
decreased in all four cell lines examined (Fig. 3B). This decrease
was mirrored by a corresponding drop in RIP1 protein level in
A2780-CP and A549 cells. These results show that TNFa treatment
tends to induce a modest down-regulation of the components of
complex II and the DISC, which may partially account for
resistance to SMC in combination with this death receptor ligand.
c-FLIP is an important apoptosis regulator that functions as an
inhibitor to caspase-8–mediated events. Given that caspase8 expression in resistant cells seems to be suppressed, we analyzed
the protein level of c-FLIP. In SMC-resistant A2780-CP cells, the
level of c-FLIP remained constant irrespective of its exposure to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

SMC-AEG40730 and TRAIL (Fig. 3C). In SMC-resistant U343 cells,
c-FLIP level was steady in response to SMC-AEG40730 alone and
remained relatively high when cotreated with TRAIL (Fig. 3C). In
the presence of SMC-AEG40730 and TRAIL, we detected a decrease
in c-FLIP level in GI-ME-N cells (Fig. 3C), which coincided with
caspase-8 activation (Fig. 3B) and the decrease in cell viability
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). These results suggest that persistent
c-FLIP expression impedes SMC-mediated apoptosis.
Next, we extended our analysis to earlier time points following
treatments of SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa. In sensitive Panc1 cells,
exposure to TNFa alone resulted in an accumulation of c-FLIP
starting at 2 hours, which became marked by 4 hours (Fig. 4A).
When Panc1 cells were pretreated with SMC, the subsequent
exposure to TNFa resulted in the processing of c-FLIP to its p43
form by 60 minutes. The c-FLIP(p43) form, which retained anti–
caspase-8 function, transiently accumulated but became weakly
detectable by 8 hours. In contrast, the levels of c-FLIP in resistant
cells (A2780-CP, A549, and U343) remained constant throughout
the 8-hour time course (Fig. 4B–D). These results indicate that, in
response to SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa treatment, levels of c-FLIP
positively correlated with the sustained viability of resistant
cells, and the down-regulation of c-FLIP preceded death in
sensitive cells.
Both NF-nB–mediated transcription and JNK-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome activation regulate the steady-state protein levels
of c-FLIP (15). The ability of SMC-AEG40730 to blunt the activation
of the TNFa-mediated classic NF-nB pathway differs to varying
degrees in the resistant and sensitive cell lines (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that NF-nB suppression alone is
unlikely to account for changes in the level of c-FLIP. The effect of
SMC-AEG40730 on JNK activation in cancer cells, however, has not
yet been studied in depth. We therefore examined the activation of
JNK in response to SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa treatment. In Panc1
cells, exposure to TNFa induced both an early, transient (10–
30 minutes), as well as a late, sustained (2–8 hours) activation of JNK
(Fig. 5A). When Panc1 cells were pretreated with SMC-AEG40730,
TNFa-mediated early transient activation of JNK2 and JNK3 was
abolished, whereas early transient activation of JNK1 was markedly
decreased (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the repression of early transient
activation of JNK, TNFa-mediated late activation of JNK persisted in
spite of SMC-AEG40730 pretreatment (Fig. 5A). This sustained
activation of JNK coincided with the loss of c-FLIP(p43) (Fig. 4A). In
cell lines resistant to SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa (A2780-CP, A549
and U343), TNFa activated the JNK pathway to varying degrees
(Fig. 5B–D). In all three cell lines, SMC-AEG40730 pretreatment
repressed JNK activation (Fig. 5B–D), suggesting that the JNK
pathway may regulate the steady-state protein levels of c-FLIP.
Endogenous c-FLIP protects resistant cancer cells from
SMC-AEG40730–mediated cell death. The correlation between
c-FLIP levels and cell viability implies that endogenous c-FLIP may
protect cancer cells from SMC and death receptor ligand activation
of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. We therefore tested this
hypothesis by silencing c-FLIP with siRNA in cancer cells, before
exposure to SMC-AEG40730 and death receptor ligands. In A2780CP cells, the depletion of c-FLIP led to the processing and
activation of caspase-8 by 2 hours following cotreatment of
SMC-AEG40730 with TRAIL and by 4 hours with SMC-AEG40730
and TNFa (Fig. 6A). We also detected the downstream processing
of caspase-3, consistent with the activation of caspase cascade.
Similarly, in c-FLIP–depleted U343, A549, and GI-ME-N cells,
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was seen as early as

c-FLIP Blocks SMC Action

2 hours after cotreatment with SMC-AEG40730 and TNFa, or
TRAIL (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). The activation of
the caspase cascade in the absence of c-FLIP in these cell lines
suggests that cancer cells will be susceptible to SMC-mediated
death receptor ligand–induced cell death if c-FLIP is repressed.
Next, we determined the role of c-FLIP in cell viability in response
to SMC and death receptor ligands. In all four cell lines, the loss of
c-FLIP led to a significant increase in cell death in response to
SMC-AEG40730 or death receptor ligand treatment alone or in
combination (Fig. 6C and D; Supplementary Fig. S4C and D).
Furthermore, c-FLIP down-regulation also accelerates the cell
death of the sensitive Panc1 cells in response to SMC and TNFa
(data not shown).
To further establish that c-FLIP is indeed the final impediment
to SMC-mediated cell death, we interrogated the effects of c-FLIP
silencing in other resistant cancer cell lines, the selection of which
was based on the criteria that their extrinsic apoptotic pathway is
intact. Without exception, all cancer cell lines examined were
sensitized to killing by the combination of SMC-AEG40730 and
TNFa following siRNA targeting c-FLIP (Supplementary Fig. S5).
These results show that endogenous c-FLIP prevents the induction
of cell death by SMC and death receptor ligand treatment.

Discussion
SMCs are a promising novel cancer therapeutic class, but their
standalone in vitro efficacy is restricted to a small subset of cancer
cell lines. Although the presence of TNFa or TRAIL enhances the
ability of SMC to induce apoptosis, many cancer cell lines remain
resistant or only modestly responsive to SMC treatment for
unknown reasons. Here, through the use of a prototypic SMC,
AEG40730, we delineate the basis for SMC resistance (Supplementary Fig. S6) and establish an indicator of sensitivity toward SMC
based on the molecular profile of cancer cells.
The responsiveness of cancer cells to the combinations of
SMC-AEG40730 and death receptor ligands can be categorized into
four groups. The first group represents those that are outright
sensitive to SMC because of the induction of a TNFa autocrine
loop (16). The second group represents those that are not affected
by SMC alone but would succumb to apoptosis when concurrently
exposed to exogenous death receptor ligands. The third group is
resistant to SMC and death receptor ligands because they lack core
components necessary for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The
fourth group, those we discovered and elucidated in this study,
includes cancer cells that are nominally resistant to the
combination of SMC and death receptor ligands, yet their extrinsic
apoptotic machinery is present. However, when we silence c-FLIP
in these cells, they too become susceptible to SMC-induced
apoptotic challenge.
We have discovered that the silencing of c-FLIP in resistant
cancer cells reverses their resistance toward the concomitant
exposure to SMC and death receptor ligands, providing that their
extrinsic apoptotic pathway is intact. In MEFs, exposure to TNFa
activates the classic NF-nB pathway, which promotes transcriptional up-regulation of c-FLIP (22). Furthermore, TNFa-mediated
NF-nB activation can up-regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphatases, which in turn inhibits JNK (23). Inhibited JNK
can no longer phosphorylate ITCH, an ubiquitin E3 ligase that can
mediate c-FLIP turnover (15, 24). We noted that in resistant cancer
cells, SMC repressed JNK activation in response to TNFa. In
contrast, JNK activation was not blunted in SMC-responsive

cells, in accord with the involvement of JNK activity in c-FLIP
metabolism. Our study thus provides significant mechanistic
insight into the mode of action of SMC and the basis of SMC
resistance (Supplementary Fig. S6).
This present study has profound implications on the utilization
of SMC. Cancer is a disease of defects in multiple pathways. Some
of these pathways contribute to the ability of cancer cells to evade
apoptosis induced by the immune surveillance and cancer therapeutics. As agents designed to enhance or reactivate apoptosis
programs, SMCs target the IAPs, which are fundamental factors
of cell death resistance in cancer cells. Death receptor ligands are
constituents of the tumor microenvironment (25, 26), and based on
synergies, will be expected to synergize with SMCs in a clinical
setting. Our results and previous studies (2, 3) show that SMC
synergizes with TRAIL, suggesting that the combination of
TRAIL agonistic antibodies with SMCs is an appealing future
therapeutic avenue.
Here, we provide compelling evidence to support a new
paradigm in which the loss of c-FLIP is pivotal to SMC-induced
death receptor ligand–mediated apoptosis. Hence, the ability of
cancer cells to resist SMC-mediated cell death by up-regulating
c-FLIP or avoiding its degradation may illustrate a potential
challenge facing the broad implementation of this class of drug.
Combination chemotherapy is widely used clinically and is also a
likely development path for the SMCs. Hence, a viable therapeutic
approach could exploit the endogenous presence of death receptor
ligands by combining SMCs with a chemotherapy that affects
c-FLIP levels. For instance, bortezomib, a proteasomal inhibitor
that is currently in use for treating multiple myeloma, can downregulate c-FLIP independently of its effect on NF-nB activity (27).
Paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor widely used in cancer chemotherapy,
can also down-regulate c-FLIP (28). Therefore, our results
suggest that a strategy that combines the use of SMC with a
c-FLIP antagonist might have a greater therapeutic effect than a
standalone treatment.
In conclusion, our study shows that silencing one single gene,
CFLAR , which encodes for c-FLIP, can reengage the apoptotic
pathway in SMC-resistant cancer cells. In the advent of personalized cancer therapeutics, our study endorses the emerging concept
of biomarker-guided therapeutic choices, in which the molecular
signature dictates optimal outcome. Such paradigms would be
leveraged considerably by the collection of data on c-FLIP responsiveness to SMCs in ongoing clinical trials.
