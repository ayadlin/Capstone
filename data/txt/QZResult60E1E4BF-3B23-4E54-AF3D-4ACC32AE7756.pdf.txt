Abstract
Identifying strategies to increase cancer cell kill while sparing
normal tissue is critically important in cancer chemotherapy.
Choline kinase (Chk), the enzyme that converts choline to
phosphocholine (PC), is elevated in cancer cells and presents
a novel target for increasing cell kill. Here, we have examined
the effects of transiently down-regulating Chk by small
interfering RNA against Chk (siRNA-chk) on PC and total
choline-containing compound (tCho) levels and on the
viability/proliferation of estrogen receptor–negative and
estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cell lines and a
nonmalignant mammary epithelial cell line. We investigated
the effects of combination treatment with transient siRNAchk transfection and the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) in those cell lines. Microarray analysis of the invasive
estrogen receptor–negative MDA-MB-231 cell line was done
to characterize molecular changes associated with Chk downregulation. Chk down-regulation decreased PC and tCho
levels in the malignant cell lines, whereas the cell viability/
proliferation assays detected a decrease in proliferation in
these cells. In contrast, Chk down-regulation had an almost
negligible effect on PC and tCho levels as well as cell
viability/proliferation in the nonmalignant cell line. A
combination of siRNA-chk with 5-FU treatment resulted in a
larger reduction of cell viability/proliferation in the breast
cancer cell lines; this reduction was evident to a much lesser
degree in the nonmalignant cells. Microarray analysis showed
that Chk down-regulation affected 33 proliferation-related
genes and 9 DNA repair–related genes. Chk down-regulation
with siRNA-chk may provide a novel alternative to enhance
the effect of anticancer drugs in malignant cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Although there is no dearth of cytotoxic therapies available to
kill cancer cells, most of these damage normal cells as well as
cancer cells, resulting in unfortunate side effects such as diarrhea,
nausea, granulocytopenia, and cardiotoxicity, to name a few (1, 2).
The ideal therapy would target cancer cells while sparing normal
tissue. Targeting pathways or molecules that are up-regulated in
cancer cells but not in normal cells can provide new strategies for
selective therapy to use either singly or in combination with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

An increase of cellular phosphocholine (PC) and total cholinecontaining compounds (tCho) has consistently been observed in
cancer cells and tissue (3–5) and is closely related to malignant
transformation, invasion, and metastasis (3, 6). Choline kinase (Chk),
a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to
form PC by ATP in the presence of magnesium (7), is one of three
enzymes that, along with phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, can lead to
increased PC levels (8, 9). Increased expression of Chk has been
observed in human lung, colon, prostate, and breast cancer as well as
derived epithelial and hemopoietic cell lines (10–18). Carcinogens
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induce liver and colon cancers with increased Chk activity (17).
Chk can also be induced by activating agents including hormones,
growth factors, oncogenes, and carcinogens (19–21). Because of its
increased expression and activity in cancer, Chk has been proposed
as a target for antitumor therapy (16, 22, 23). Chk inhibition using the
pharmacologic inhibitor MN58b was recently shown to reduce proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and xenografts in vivo (22, 24–27).
To avoid the side effects associated with pharmacologic inhibition,
we used small interfering RNA (siRNA-chk) to target Chk and
showed that both transient transfection and stable expression of
siRNA against Chk induced differentiation and reduced proliferation
in breast cancer cells (15).
Our purpose in this study was twofold. One was to examine the
effect of transiently down-regulating Chk in normal and malignant
human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) on cell viability and
proliferation, and the second was to determine if combining Chk
down-regulation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment increased
cell kill in cancer cells. 5-FU is commonly used to treat a variety
of cancers including breast, head and neck, and colon (28, 29). One
of the main mechanisms of action of 5-FU is the inhibition of
thymidylate synthase by the 5-FU metabolite 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine-5¶-monophosphate, which leads to cell death (28). This effect
is not specific to tumor cells, making 5-FU a highly toxic drug, with
a narrow margin of safety, which can cause severe hematologic
toxicity and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (30). Several other
chemotherapeutic agents such as mitomycin C have similar
toxicity, and therefore combination therapies with agents that
increase cell kill in cancer cells but not in normal cells would be
attractive to reduce toxicity and maintain or increase efficacy.
In this study, we examined the effects of transient downregulation of Chk, using siRNA-chk transfection, on PC and tCho
levels and on the viability/proliferation of two human breast cancer
cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor
negative) and MCF-7 (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor
positive), and a nonmalignant HMEC line, MCF-12A. We investigated the effect of combining transient siRNA-chk transfection
with the anticancer drug 5-FU on cell viability/proliferation in
these cell lines as well. Because MDA-MB-231 cells were the more
aggressive, microarray analysis of these cells was done to

comparable dose of 5-FU, a greater reduction in cell viability/
proliferation was achieved with transient siRNA-chk transfection in
breast cancer cells compared with nonmalignant HMECs.

Materials and Methods

characterize molecular changes associated with Chk downregulation. We chose to examine transient down-regulation
because this would be the most likely option in the clinical setting
using liposomal or viral mediated delivery of siRNA or short
hairpin RNA.
Results from magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cell extracts
and Chk expression levels following transient transfection of
siRNA-chk showed that Chk plays an important role in generating
the high PC and tCho levels observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells but not in the nonmalignant HMEC line MCF12A. The cell viability/proliferation assay showed that Chk downregulation reduced cell viability/proliferation of both estrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor–negative and estrogen receptor/
progesterone receptor–positive breast cancer cells but not
nonmalignant MCF-12A cells. Microarray analysis of MDA-MB231 cells showed that Chk down-regulation affected 33 proliferation-related genes and 9 DNA repair–related genes in these cells.
Combined treatment with siRNA-chk transfection and 5-FU
reduced the cell viability/proliferation to levels that were
significantly lower than either treatment alone in both breast
cancer cell lines. In contrast, although the nonmalignant HMECs
were sensitive to 5-FU treatment, the combination treatment
resulted in a smaller reduction of cell viability/proliferation
compared with the malignant cells. These data show that for a

Cell culture. MDA-MB-231, an estrogen receptor–negative metastatic
human breast cancer cell line, was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
9% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (90 unit/mL penicillin and
90 Ag/mL streptomycin). MCF-7, an estrogen receptor–positive poorly
metastatic human breast cancer cell line, was cultured in Eagle’s MEM
supplemented with 9% FBS and antibiotics. MCF-12A, a spontaneously
immortalized nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cell line, was
cultured in DMEM-Ham’s F12 medium supplemented as described
previously (3). All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2 in air at 37jC.
RNA interference experiments. siRNA-chk was designed as previously
described (15) and purchased from Dharmacon. Approximately 98 nmol/L
of siRNA-chk were transfected for 48 h using Oligofectamine and Opti-MEM
(both from Invitrogen) based on the observed decrease of Chk message
using reverse transcription-PCR analysis within this time (15).
Dual-phase cell extraction and magnetic resonance spectroscopy
study. Cells were transfected with siRNA-chk for 48 h and water-soluble
as well as lipid extracts were obtained from f2  107 control and siRNAchk–treated cells using the dual-phase extraction method (15). Control
cell extracts were obtained from cells without siRNA-chk treatment. Cell
extracts were resuspended in 0.6-mL deuterated water for magnetic
resonance spectroscopy analysis. Five microliters of 0.75% (w/w) 3(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TMSP) in deuterated
water were used as an internal standard. Fully relaxed 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra of the water-soluble extracts were acquired
on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp.) as
previously described (15). Signal integrals of N-(CH3)3 of free choline
(Cho), PC, and glycerophosphocholine (GPC) from within the 3.20 to 3.24
ppm region were determined and normalized to cell numbers and
compared with the standard. To determine concentrations, peak
integration (In ) from 1H spectra for PC, GPC, Cho, and tCho (PC +
GPC + Cho) was compared with that of the internal standard TMSP
according to the following equation:

In this equation, [metabolite] is the molar concentration per cell of the

the sample, and N cell is the cell number. Because the number of protons
contributing to the signal of all the choline (Cho) metabolites at 3.20 to 3.24
ppm and to the TMSP peak at 0 ppm is the same, correction for differences
in the number of protons was not required.
Immunoblot analysis. Approximately 3  106 cells were grown in
culture medium overnight and transfected with siRNA-chk for 48 h. Cells
were scraped into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton-100, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, and
complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Cell lysates were
incubated on ice for 15 min and spun down at 16,000  g (Refrigerated
Centrifuge 5415 R, Eppendorf). Protein samples from whole-cell extracts
were resolved on one-dimensional 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto
immunoblot polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using a semidry
transfer unit (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated overnight in
blocking solution [1% dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20] with custommade polyclonal Chk antibody (Proteintech Group, Inc.; ref. 15) with an
appropriate dilution. Anti–h-actin antibody (Molecular Probes) was used
for equal loading assessment. Secondary antibody was horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin G (Vector Laboratories). Reactions were revealed using SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce
Biotech.) recorded on Blue Bio film (Denville Scientific). Chk was detected
at f48 kDa.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
Cells were grown in culture medium without phenol red. Approximately
4,000 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate and cultured
overnight. Twenty-four hours later, siRNA-chk was transfected transiently
for 48 h, as previously described (15). No treatment or Oligofectamine
without siRNA was used as negative control. For combination experiments,
5-FU ( final concentration, 5 Ag/mL) was added 24 h after transfection
without changing medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection and/or
24 h after 5-FU treatment, cells were cultured for another 3 days in fresh
culture medium. Cell viability/proliferation was evaluated with the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Cell Proliferation Assay (ATCC) and values were compared with those obtained from
untreated cells.

isolated from f107 siRNA-chk–treated or control MDA-MB-231 cells as

described above using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and QIAshredder
homogenizer spin columns (Qiagen) as previously described (14, 31). The
microarray hybridization was done at the JHMI Microarray Core Facility
(Dr. Francisco Martinez Murillo, Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine) using the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Inc.),
which contains >47,000 transcripts, and the Affymetrix GeneChip platform.
GeneChips were analyzed by fluorescence detection using the Agilent
GeneArray Scanner as previously described (14, 31). Data acquisition was
done using the Micro Array Suite 5.0 software by Affymetrix as previously
described (14, 31). Experiments were done in duplicate. To estimate the
gene expression signals, data analysis was conducted on the chips’ cell
intensity (CEL) file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair [perfect
match (PM) probe and mismatch (MM) probe] level using statistical
techniques and package Robust Multiarray Analysis (14, 31). The criterion of
the posterior probability >0.5, which means that the posterior probability is
larger than chance, was used to produce differentially expressed gene lists.
All computations were done under the R package EBarrays environment as
previously described (32–34).
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean F SE. The statistical
significance of differences in cell metabolite levels and MTT assay result was
determined using an unpaired t test (two-tailed). P V 0.03 for cell metabolite
levels and P V 0.01 for MTT assay were considered to be significant.

Results
Chk protein level was down-regulated by transient siRNAchk transfection. The immunoblot assay results with Chk
antibody showed significant reduction of Chk protein expression
levels in MCF-12A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells after transient
siRNA-chk transfection (Fig. 1). Chk levels in nonmalignant MCF12A cells were much lower than the two breast cancer cell lines.
This assay was repeated thrice and the results were reproducible.
Significantly lower Chk protein levels after transient siRNA-chk
transfection confirmed successful transfection and down-regulation of Chk levels.

lower than in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2). A comparison of PC, GPC,
and tCho levels of cells treated with siRNA-chk versus control cells
(Fig. 3) revealed a significant reduction of PC and tCho in the
malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells following transient
transfection with siRNA-chk compared with control cells. A
significant reduction of PC in the estrogen receptor–positive breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 was also observed after siRNA-chk
transfection. There were no statistically significant changes in PC,
tCho, or GPC in nonmalignant MCF-12A cells following transient
siRNA-chk transfection (Fig. 3). We carried out control studies with
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA to rule out the
possibility of poor transfection of these cells with siRNA (data not
shown).
Cell viability/proliferation assay of a nonmalignant HMEC
line and two human breast cancer cell lines after transient
siRNA-chk transfection. Both breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 showed significant reduction of viability/proliferation following transient transfection using siRNA-chk alone
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the reduction
of viability/proliferation was negligible in nonmalignant MCF-12A
cells (Fig. 4).
Cell viability/proliferation assay of a nonmalignant HMEC
line and two human breast cancer cell lines after treatment
with 5-FU alone or in combination with siRNA-chk transfection.
Treatment with 5-FU alone resulted in a reduction of viability/
proliferation of all cell lines (Fig. 4). MCF-12A, which has the lowest
expression level of Chk protein, showed the highest reduction in
cell viability/proliferation by 5-FU alone. The combination
treatment of 5-FU and siRNA-chk down-regulation resulted in a
2-fold reduction of cell viability/proliferation in breast cancer cell
lines compared with 5-FU treatment alone (Fig. 4), but only a 10%
additional reduction in the nonmalignant cell line. As a result, for
a comparable dose of 5-FU, the reduction in cell viability/
proliferation was as much or higher for the breast cancer cells
compared with the nonmalignant cells, although the nonmalignant
cells were more sensitive to 5-FU alone.

GeneChip microarray gene expression assay for proliferation- and DNA repair–related genes. Table 1 shows that 16
proliferation-related genes were significantly overexpressed and 17
proliferation-related genes significantly underexpressed following
siRNA-chk transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells. Nine DNA repair–
related genes were significantly differentially expressed following
transient siRNA-chk transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells as shown in
Table 2. However, none of the genes directly involved in 5-FU
metabolism, such as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidine
phosphorylase, thymidylate synthase, human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1, or uridine phosphorylase, among others (28),
were differentially expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells transiently
transfected with siRNA-chk compared with control cells (data not
shown).

Discussion
We have previously shown that siRNA-chk induced differentiation and reduced cell proliferation markers in breast cancer cells
(15). There are at least three isoforms of Chk (chk-a1, chk-a2, and
chk-h) in mammalian cells (7). Our siRNA-chk was designed using
the mRNA sequences transcribed from the chk-a and chk-b genes
to allow down-regulation of both of these Chk mRNAs. Our
immunoblot assay confirmed successful transient transfection and
down-regulation of Chk protein expression levels in all three cell
lines used. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies confirmed the
successful down-regulation of siRNA-chk and showed the significant dependence of the elevated PC levels in breast cancer cells on
Chk as evident from the low PC following transient siRNA-chk
transfection. Because MCF-12A cells have low basal Chk protein
and PC levels, the effect of Chk down-regulation by siRNA-chk was
not significant for PC levels in nonmalignant MCF-12A cells.
Another possibility may be that PC in MCF-12A cells may not be
primarily dependent on Chk and may be derived through other
enzymes. The differences in Chk expression levels between
malignant and nonmalignant cells obtained here are consistent
with data from our previous study (15).

Cell viability/proliferation was significantly lower in both
estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor–positive and estrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor–negative breast cancer cells following transient siRNA-chk transfection. Importantly, transient
transfection of nonmalignant MCF-12A cells with siRNA-chk had a
negligible effect on cell viability/proliferation. These data suggest
that transient Chk silencing may reduce cell viability/proliferation
in cells with high Chk such as malignant cells but may not affect
nonmalignant cells with low Chk. These data support exploring
transient Chk silencing as a broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic
agent for cancer cells.
The reduction of cell viability/proliferation following a single
dose of 5-FU was highest in the nonmalignant cells with the lowest
Chk expression. Malignant cells with higher Chk expression were

more resistant to 5-FU treatment. Combined treatment of both
breast cancer cell lines with siRNA-chk transfection and 5-FU
reduced viability/proliferation to levels that were similar for both
estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor–positive and estrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor–negative cells and f2-fold lower
than either treatment alone. Although the nonmalignant MCF-12A
cells had the most profound reduction of cell viability/proliferation
with 5-FU treatment, combining 5-FU treatment with siRNA-chk
transfection resulted in a reduction of cell viability/proliferation in
the breast cancer cells that was as much or even more than that in
the nonmalignant cells. The increase of cell kill was most likely
additive rather than synergistic because the microarray data
showed no effect with Chk down-regulation on 5-FU–related genes
such as thymidylate synthase.

The microarray analysis detected changes in the expression of 33
proliferation-related genes with Chk down-regulation. One gene
significantly influenced by Chk down-regulation was MXI1 (3.8fold), which is a c-Myc antagonist and is induced by hypoxiainducible factor 1. Whereas MXI1 is considered a potential tumor
suppressor, it also protects cells from c-Myc-induced apoptosis
(35, 36). Overexpression of both negative (CDKN1B, CDKN1C, NF1,
and SMAD1) and positive (EDN1 and FGFR1OP) regulators of cell
proliferation and underexpression of positive (PBEF1, DNAJA2, and
SSR1) regulators of cell proliferation were also observed. EDN1 is a
potent vasoconstrictor peptide, which is also involved in differentiation, apoptosis, and matrix metalloprotease expression (37).
In a previous study, indomethacin-mediated down-regulation of
PC levels in breast cancer cells was also associated with
overexpression of EDN1 as detected by microarray analysis (31).
Nine DNA repair genes were affected by Chk down-regulation. One
of the most significant effects was the 3-fold underexpression of
RAD23B (3.2-fold). The protein encoded by this gene contains an
NH2-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that can bind the proteosome
(38, 39). Rad23/proteosome binding is necessary for efficient
nucleotide excision repair, which is the primary mechanism for
removing UV-induced DNA lesions (40). It has been shown that
Rad23 has additional functions that are required for cell survival
(40). We are currently exploring the role of Chk in multidrug
resistance and DNA repair to determine if increased expression of
Chk provides protection to cells during chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the down-regulation of Chk by transient
transfection of siRNA-chk resulted in a significant reduction of cell
proliferation in both estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor–
positive and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor–negative
malignant human breast cancer cell lines but not in nonmalignant
HMECs. A combination of siRNA-chk transfection and 5-FU
treatment resulted in increased cell kill in both cancer cell lines
compared with each of these treatments given alone. Although the
nonmalignant cells were the most sensitive to 5-FU treatment, the
combination treatment resulted in comparable or even higher
reduction of cell viability/proliferation in the cancer cells compared
with the nonmalignant cells. Microarray analysis showed that Chk
down-regulation affected 33 proliferation-related genes and 9 DNA
repair–related genes. Our study supports the possibility that Chk
silencing may provide a safe and effective therapy against cancer
and be a novel alternative to enhance the effect of anticancer drugs.
The development of therapy using RNA interference targeting Chk
may be a useful and selective treatment strategy for breast cancer.
