Abstract
One of the hallmarks of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its pronounced type I collagenrich fibrotic reaction. Although recent reports have shown that the fibrotic reaction can limit the efficacy of
gemcitabine chemotherapy, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this article, we show that
the type I collagen allows PDAC cells to override checkpoint arrest induced by gemcitabine. Relative to cells
grown on tissue culture plastic, PDAC cells grown in 3-dimensional collagen microenvironment have minimal
Chk1 phosphorylation and continue to proliferate in the presence of gemcitabine. Collagen increases membrane
type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)–dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation to limit the effect of
gemcitabine. Collagen also increases MT1-MMP–dependent high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) expression, a
nonhistone DNA-binding nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, to attenuate
the effect of gemcitabine. Overexpression of MT1-MMP in the collagen microenvironment increases ERK1/2
phosphorylation and HMGA2 expression, and thereby further attenuates gemcitabine-induced checkpoint
arrest. MT1-MMP also allows PDAC cells to continue to proliferate in the presence of gemcitabine in a xenograft
mouse model. Clinically, human tumors with increased MT1-MMP show increased HMGA2 expression. Overall,
our data show that collagen upregulation of MT1-MMP contributes to gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in a
xenograft mouse model, and suggest that targeting MT1-MMP could be a novel approach to sensitize pancreatic
tumors to gemcitabine. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1019–28. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Very little progress has been made in the treatment of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the fourth leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (1).
Because pancreatic cancer causes minimal early signs or
symptoms, most patients present with locally advanced or
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (2). The primary
treatment option for patients with advanced disease includes
chemotherapy, with gemcitabine as the preferred therapy.
Despite being the first line treatment for patients with PDAC,

majority of the patients do not benefit from gemcitabine (3).
Molecular targeted therapies have failed to show a clinically
significant improvement over gemcitabine alone (4), raising
an urgent need to understand the reasons for the poor
response of PDAC tumors to current therapeutic agents.
Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog that competes with cytidine during DNA replication, has been shown to activate cell
cycle checkpoints that allow cells time for repair and determine whether to progress through the cell cycle or to undergo
apoptosis. Gemcitabine activates Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, key
effectors of the checkpoint response (5). Activation of Chk1
during DNA replication stalls cell cycle progression, prevents
premature mitotic entry, and allows time to repair the
damaged DNA. Cells resistant to arrest continue replicating
despite the accumulated double-strand breaks, resulting in
cells with mutations progressing through the cell cycle, causing genomic instability. Although Chk1 and Chk2 were initially
thought to have specific roles, Chk2 may be redundant in
checkpoint activation and may primarily modulate Chk1
responses (6).
Human pancreatic cancers are associated with an intense
fibrotic reaction, the encasing tissue composed of interstitial
extracellular matrix (ECM) and proliferating stromal cells. The
fibrotic reaction was recently shown to limit the delivery and

efficacy of gemcitabine in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer
(7, 8). It also contributes to the malignant phenotype of PDAC
(9), in part, by increasing expression of the proteinase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP; ref. 10).
PDAC is also associated with increased expression of high
mobility group A2 (HMGA2): a nonhistone DNA-binding
protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (11). HMGA2 is increased in high-grade pancreatic
tumors with lymph node metastases (12), and consistent with
its role in pancreatic cancer invasion, HMGA2 is involved in
maintaining Ras-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT; ref.13). HMGA2 also modulates expression of genes that
are important for cell proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis
(14, 15).
In this article, we examine the mechanism by which collagen promotes gemcitabine resistance. We show that the 3dimensional (3D) collagen microenvironment protects PDAC
cells from gemcitabine-induced proliferation arrest and cell
cycle arrest. The effect of collagen is mediated through
increased MT1-MMP–dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation and HMGA2 expression. Blocking MT1-MMP induction sensitizes pancreatic
cancer cells in collagen to gemcitabine-induced checkpoint
activation, whereas overexpressing MT1-MMP further attenuates gemcitabine-induced checkpoint arrest. Clinically,
human tumors with increased MT1-MMP show increased
HMGA2 expression. Overall, we show that collagen-mediated
upregulation of MT1-MMP contributes to gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model, and targeting
MT1-MMP could be a novel approach to sensitize pancreatic
tumors to gemcitabine.

Generation of PDAC cells inducibly expressing MT1MMP
Full-length MT1-MMP and the DC mutant were subcloned
into pRetroX-Tight-Pur vector (Clontech). Panc1 and CD18
cells inducibly expressing MT1-MMP were generated as previously described (17).
Transfection
Cells were transfected with siRNA against MT1-MMP,
HMGA2, or control siRNA (50 nmoles), or the pre-miR to
let-7 or pre-miR negative control (at 50 nmoles) using Nucleofector Kit R (Lonza), allowed to recover overnight and then
plated either on plastic or in 3D collagen gels (2 mg/mL).
Alternatively, cells were transfected using RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions before plating
into collagen.
Proliferation assay
Proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured
as previously described (18).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Quantitative gene expression was performed for MT1-MMP,
HMGA2, and GAPDH as previously published (17). Similarly,
expression of let-7a/d/g and RNU48 was analyzed as previously published (19).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was done as previously described (10). For
cells grown in collagen, the matrix was first dissolved in
collagenase (Worthington Biologicals) and then lysed as previously described (10).

Materials and Methods
Chemicals/reagents
MT1-MMP antibody was purchased from Abcam,
ppERK1/2 and PARP antibodies from Cell Signaling, HMGA2
antibody from Biocheck Inc., and a-tubulin antibody from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Type I collagen was purchased from BD
Biosciences, Matrigel from R&D Systems, and MEK (MAP/
ERK kinase) inhibitor U0126 from Cell Signaling. Gemcitabine was obtained from Eli Lilly. Nucleofector electroporation kit was purchased from Lonza and lipofectamine
RNAiMax from Invitrogen. An HMGA2 siRNA and pre-miRs
let-7a, let-7d, let-7g, and negative control #1 were purchased
from Applied Biosystems. An siRNA for MT1-MMP targeted
against nucleotides 228 to 248 was purchased from Invitrogen (16).
Cell culture
Panc1, CD18/HPAF-II, and AsPC1 cells were obtained from
ATCC. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin). The cells were tested
in December 2009 and June 2010 by STR profiling at the Johns
Hopkins Genetic Resources Core Facility and showed a similar
profile to that on the ATCC website.

Zymography
MT1-MMP activity analysis was done by SDS-PAGE gelatin
zymography as described previously (17).
Subcutaneous tumor studies
Mice were treated in accordance with guidelines approved
by the Northwestern University IACUC. Eight-week-old athymic nu/nu animals were injected subcutaneously with 10 
106 tet-on Panc1-tet-V in the left flank whereas Panc1-tet-DC
cells were injected into the right flank of the same animal. For
CD18-tet-V and CD18-tet-DC, 5  105 cells were injected.
Twenty-four hours later, doxycycline (200 mg/L) was added to
the drinking water to induce protein expression. After 1 week,
mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2 doses of gemcitabine (15 mg/kg) 2 days apart (20). Mice were then euthanized, and tumors processed for mRNA and histologic studies.
The experiment to study the effect of inhibiting MT1-MMP
expression in CD18 cells was conducted similarly. After maintaining the mice (n ¼ 10) on doxycycline water for 2 weeks, 5
mice were switched to regular water for 1 week to inhibit MT1MMP expression. Four mice in each group were then administered gemcitabine as described earlier. The tumor samples
were stained for trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),
and immunostained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; 1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Images were taken

Results

most common ECM present in the fibrotic reaction, contributes to chemoresistance, we treated PDAC cells (Panc1,
CD18, and AsPC1) grown on plastic or in 3D collagen with
low levels of gemcitabine (100 mmol/L) for 24 hours and
assessed proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation. As seen
in Figure 1A, although only a minority of cells on plastic
proliferate following gemcitabine treatment, most cells in 3D
collagen continue to proliferate in the presence of gemcitabine. In the absence of gemcitabine, 3D collagen had no effect
on proliferation (Fig. 1B). We also examined the effect of
gemcitabine on checkpoint activation by immunoblotting for
Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345. Cells growing in collagen
displayed minimal activation of Chk1 compared with the
robust Chk1 activation in cells grown on plastic (Fig. 1C),
indicating that collagen helps cells evade arrest and continue
to proliferate. Note that there was minimal- to no-PARP
cleavage following treatment with 100 mmol/L gemcitabine
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To examine whether the effect on
checkpoint arrest was due to collagen or the 3D microenvironment, Panc1 cells were grown on plastic, atop 3D collagen
gels, or within 3D collagen gels, and then treated with gemcitabine. Chk1 phosphorylation was similar between cells grown
on plastic and on 3D collagen (Fig. 1D). However, compared
with cells grown on 3D collagen, there was a significant
reduction in Chk1 phosphorylation in cells grown in 3D
(Fig. 1E). To determine whether the effect of the 3D

microenvironment on checkpoint activation was unique to
collagen or applicable to other matrices, we also examined the
effect of 3D matrigel on checkpoint activation. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S2, cells grown in 3D Matrigel showed
similar response as in 3D collagen, indicating that the effect is
mediated by the 3D microenvironment. Because collagen is
the predominant ECM in human PDAC tumors, we conducted
subsequent experiments in 3D collagen gels.

lagen-mediated attenuation of Chk1 phosphorylation. Panc1
cells in collagen show reduced levels of let-7 relative to cells on
plastic (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although pre-miR let-7
repressed HMGA2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
C), it did not reverse the effect of collagen on gemcitabineinduced Chk1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3D),
indicating that let-7 and HMGA2 differentially affect Chk1
phosphorylation in collagen.

HMGA2 contributes to gemcitabine resistance of PDAC
cells in 3D collagen
HMGA2 was recently shown to protect cancer cells from
DNA damage-induced apoptosis (21). We therefore examined
the role of HMGA2 in mediating the effect of collagen on
gemcitabine-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. We initially
found that Panc1 cells grown in collagen show increased
expression of HMGA2 mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B)
relative to cells grown on plastic. To show that HMGA2
mediates the effect of collagen on gemcitabine-induced checkpoint arrest, Panc1 cells depleted of HMGA2 protein were
grown in collagen in the presence or absence of gemcitabine.
As shown in Figure 2C, knocking down HMGA2 sensitized
Panc1 cells to gemcitabine-mediated cell cycle arrest as seen
by the relative increase in Chk1 phosphorylation when compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells. Increased
Chk1 phosphorylation in HMGA2-depleted cells was associated with a trend toward further reduction in proliferation
in 3D collagen (Fig. 2D). Because the microRNA let-7 is a
known inhibitor of HMGA2 (22), we examined the effect of
collagen on let-7 levels and the contribution of let-7 to col-

The interplay between ERK1/2 and HMGA2 contributes
to gemcitabine resistance of PDAC cells in collagen
The MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is known to be responsible for promoting survival signals, and blocking ERK1/2
phosphorylation with U0126 increases gemcitabine sensitivity
(23, 24). Because Panc1 cells grown in collagen showed
increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with cells
grown on plastic (Fig. 3A), we examined the effect of U0126
on collagen regulation of Chk1 phosphorylation. Treatment
with U0126 inhibited collagen-induced ERK1/2 activation and
HMGA2 expression (Fig. 3B), enhanced gemcitabine-induced
Chk1 phosphorylation in Panc1 cells (Fig. 3C, top) and
reduced proliferation (Fig. 3C, bottom). Interestingly, knocking down HMGA2 in Panc1 cells grown in collagen also
decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D), suggesting that
a feedback loop exists between HMGA2 and ERK1/2 to help
sustain ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the collagen microenvironment.

MT1-MMP siRNA potentiates gemcitabine-induced
checkpoint arrest and decreases HMGA2 and phosphoERK1/2
As we had previously shown that collagen induces MT1MMP expression in PDAC cells (ref. 10; Fig. 4A), we examined
the effect of MT1-MMP siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4) on
collagen regulation of Chk1 phosphorylation. Treatment with
gemcitabine robustly induced pS345Chk1 in control siRNAtransfected cells plated on plastic, and collagen significantly
attenuated the effect (Fig. 4B, top, compare lanes 2 and 6).
Although MT1-MMP siRNA-transfected cells also showed
robust pS345Chk1 on plastic, there was minimal attenuation
of Chk1 phosphorylation in collagen (Fig. 4B, top, compare
lanes 4 and 8). Similarly, MT1-MMP siRNA attenuated the
effect of collagen on gemcitabine-induced pS345Chk1 in
AsPC1 cells (Fig. 4B, bottom). These results show that collagen
contributes to gemcitabine resistance of PDAC cells by
increasing MT1-MMP. Knocking-down MT1-MMP also
decreased collagen-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 4C) and HMGA2 expression (Fig. 4D).
MT1-MMP expression attenuates gemcitabine-induced

To further examine the role of MT1-MMP in mediating
gemcitabine resistance in collagen, we generated Panc1 cells
with inducible expression of wild-type or tailless (DC) MT1MMP. Doxycycline treatment increased MT1-MMP expression
(Supplementary Fig. S5A) and promoted MMP-2 activation,
with the DC mutant showing a more pronounced effect

(Supplementary Fig. S5B). As shown in Figure 5A, overexpression of MT1-MMP in collagen attenuated the effect of gemcitabine on Chk1 phosphorylation in Panc1 (top panel) and
CD18 cells (bottom panel). Expression of both wild-type and
tailless MT1-MMP protein also increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and HMGA2 expression (Fig. 5B). To show that the
effect of MT1-MMP on Chk1 phosphorylation was mediated
by ERK1/2 and HMGA2, Panc1-MT1-MMP cells were treated
with U0126 or transfected with siRNA against HMGA2. Blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 (Fig. 5C) and knocking
down HMGA2 expression (Fig. 5D) partly reversed the effect of
MT1-MMP and sensitized the cells to gemcitabine as indicated by increased pS345Chk1 levels. We also examined the
relationship between MT1-MMP and HMGA2 in human PDAC
tumor samples. As shown in Figure 5E, tumor samples with
increased MT1-MMP showed increased HMGA2 levels (r ¼
0.5013, P ¼ 0.0206).

with gemcitabine. Tumors were excised and processed for
MT1-MMP mRNA expression and stained with H&E and with
trichrome to assess fibrosis, and for PCNA to examine proliferation. There was robust MT1-MMP expression in CD18MT1-MMP and Panc1-MT1-MMP tumors relative to the corresponding control tumors (data not shown). Consistent with
previous reports that MT1-MMP–expressing tumors show
increased stromal reaction (17, 25), there was also increased
stromal reaction in the MT1-MMP expressing PDAC tumors
(Fig. 6A). Additionally, there was suggestion of increased
collagen in the MT1-MMP–expressing tumors as indicated
by the increased blue staining in the trichrome images
(Fig. 6B). Although there was no difference in the size of these
tumors or their proliferation in the absence of gemcitabine
treatment, MT1-MMP–overexpressing PDAC tumors displayed greater proliferation relative to control PDAC tumors
following gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 6C and D). The gemcitabine treatment regimen used for these animal studies did
not induce apoptosis; and given the short duration of these
animal studies, no difference in tumor size was detected (data
not shown).
We next examined whether switching off MT1-MMP in
established tumors increases the sensitivity of PDAC cells
to gemcitabine. CD18 cells expressing vector or DC were
injected into nude mice and the mice were maintained on

doxycycline for 2 weeks to induce MT1-MMP. Thereafter, half
of the mice were switched to regular water for an additional
week to stop MT1-MMP induction before treatment with
gemcitabine. As shown in Supplementary Figure S6, control
mice maintained on doxycycline showed a 4- to 10-fold MT1MMP induction in the CD18-DC tumors, whereas mice
switched to regular water showed at most a 2-fold induction
in MT1-MMP levels in the CD18-DC tumors. Significantly,
switching off MT1-MMP expression in established tumors
resulted in a statistically significant attenuation of proliferation (Fig. 6E and F). These experiments show that MT1-MMP
can attenuate the effect of gemcitabine in the in vivo tumor
microenvironment.

Discussion
The collagen-rich tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in cancer progression. Type I collagen not only
promotes tumor migration and invasion of cancer cells, but
also protects cancer cells against chemotherapy. Work done in
lung cancer showed that collagen allows cells treated with
chemotherapy to override checkpoints and continue through
the cell cycle with damaged DNA (26). In our study, we
delineate the mechanism by which collagen reduces the effectiveness of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. The effect of
collagen on checkpoint arrest was seen primarily in the 3D
collagen microenvironment and was not detected atop 3D gels,
suggesting the importance of 3D tumor microenvironment in
regulating cellular response. Cells in 3D Matrigel also showed

attenuation of gemcitabine response, further showing the
importance of 3D microenvironment. The differential effect
of on collagen versus in collagen could be because of decreased
penetration of gemcitabine into 3D collagen gels; however, it is
now well established that cells respond differently to 2D
surfaces versus 3D environments, and activate distinct pathways on 2D tissue culture plastic versus in 3D gels (27, 28).
We show that 3D collagen increases HMGA2 and thereby
attenuates the effect of gemcitabine. Expression of HMGA1
has been shown to be a determinant of chemoresistance in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (29, 30), but a role for HMGA2 is
yet to be established. Although HMGA2 can sensitize breast
cancer and salivary epithelial cells to doxorubicin (31), it can
also protect cancer cells against DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity. HMGA2 is part of the base end-join repair machinery
that removes small damaged bases from the DNA, and has an
apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity to protect against the
effects of chemotherapy (21). HMGA2 contributes to genomic
instability and tumor progression by inhibiting the DNA repair
enzyme DNA-dependent protein kinase during the nonhomologous DNA end joining repair process (32). HMGA2 has been
shown to maintain cancer stem cells in their undifferentiated
state (33) and because stem cells are resistant to most
cytotoxic chemotherapy, HMGA2 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance by modulating stem cell function.
We have found that collagen-induced HMGA2 induction
involves ERK1/2 signaling, which agrees with a previous report
showing that Raf-1–induced and phorbol 12 myristate 13
acetate–induced HMGA2 expression was blocked by the

Panc1 and CD18 cells inducibly expressing vector (V) or full-length MT1-MMP were grown in collagen, treated with gemcitabine for 24 hours, and
immunoblotted for pS345Chk1. B, Panc1 cells expressing V, full-length MT1-MMP, or tailless mutant of MT1-MMP (DC) were grown in collagen and
immunoblotted for ppERK1/2 and HMGA2. C, Panc1-MT cells grown in collagen were treated with gemcitabine and cotreated with DMSO or U0126,
and analyzed for pS345Chk1 and ppERK1/2 expression. D, Panc1-MT cells transfected with control or HMGA2 siRNA (50 nmol/L) were plated in collagen
before treating with gemcitabine for 24 hours and immunoblotted for pS345Chk1. E, deidentified PDAC samples (n ¼ 21) were procured on an IRB-approved
protocol. The cancerous and adjacent normal tissue samples were processed for MT1-MMP and HMGA2 mRNA by qRT-PCR, and the relationship
between MT1-MMP and HMGA2 was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (34). ERK1/2 was also shown to
upregulate HMGA2 in metastatic breast cancer cells (19),
whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 decreased HMGA2 levels in
PDAC cells (13). The MEK/ERK signaling pathway promotes
chemotherapy resistance in a number of different cancers
including multiple myeloma (35), hepatocellular carcinoma,
(23) and pancreatic cancer (24). Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling
can also sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy (36). Here we
show that inhibiting ERK1/2 decreased collagen-induced
HMGA2 induction, and sensitized cells to gemcitabineinduced checkpoint and proliferation arrest. Interestingly,
we found that HMGA2 may function to sustain ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as downregulation of HMGA2 decreased ERK1/2
activation by collagen. These findings show that the interplay
between HMGA2 and ERK1/2 contributes to attenuating the
effect of gemcitabine in the collagen microenvironment.
HMGA2 is also regulated by the let-7 family of microRNAs,
which can bind to the 30 UTR of HMGA2 and cause degradation
of HMGA2 mRNA (22, 37). Although let-7 is a negative regulator
of HMGA2 in PDAC cells, and we recently showed that MT1MMP in turn inhibits let-7 in collagen (38), expression of pre-miR
let-7 did not abrogate the effect of gemcitabine in the collagen
microenvironment. Interestingly, a recent report showed that
there was differential regulation of EMT and proliferation by
HMGA2, and let-7 in pancreatic cancer cells (13). Knocking
down HMGA2 with siRNA reversed the mesenchymal pheno-

type of pancreatic cancer cells and decreased proliferation;
however, expression of let-7 did not affect EMT or proliferation
even though HMGA2 levels were decreased (13).
The changes we observed in HMGA2-ERK1/2 signaling, and
the downstream effect on gemcitabine sensitivity, were both
mediated by collagen-induced MT1-MMP expression. Our studies show that knocking down MT1-MMP enhanced the effect of
gemcitabine, whereas overexpressing MT1-MMP further attenuated the effect of gemcitabine in collagen. The effect of MT1MMP on checkpoint arrest was mediated through HMGA2 and
ERK1/2. Interestingly, the effect of MT1-MMP was only seen in
the collagen microenvironment as modulation of MT1-MMP in
cells on plastic had minimal effect on checkpoint arrest, suggesting that additional microenvironment-dependent signaling
is required. It is now well established that 3D focal adhesions of
cells are very different in molecular composition when compared with 2D focal adhesions (28). Significantly, MT1-MMP can
increase the functionality of the collagen-binding a2b1 integrin
in breast cancer cells (39). Moreover, integrin-linked kinase,
which can interact with the cytoplasmic tail of b1 integrin, has
been shown to contribute to gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells (40). Thus, it is possible that MT1-MMP
potentiates integrin signaling only in the 3D microenvironment
to enhance gemcitabine resistance.
Clinically, it was recently shown that pancreatic cancer cells
are not inherently resistant to gemcitabine, but the pro-

HMGA2 Mediates Gemcitabine Resistance in 3D Collagen

Figure 7. Enhancement of gemcitabine resistance by MT1-MMP in PDAC.
Our data show that PDAC cells in the collagen microenvironment express
MT1-MMP, causing increased ERK1/2-dependent HMGA2 expression.
This signaling pathway allows PDAC cells to resist gemcitabine-induced
cell cycle arrest and proliferation arrest, both in vitro and in vivo.

nounced desmoplastic reaction causes acquired resistance (7).
Our results show that blocking MT1-MMP can be an effective
way to increase the response to gemcitabine in collagen and in
the in vivo microenvironment. Previously, broad spectrum
MMP inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine in animal
models were shown to decrease pancreatic tumor growth (41).
However, a large phase III clinical trial in patients with
pancreatic cancer showed no difference in response with
broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine (42). The lack of efficacy may be because these inhibitors nonselectively targeted all MMPs (43, 44). It has now

been clearly shown that some MMPs possess tumor-inhibiting
functions making it imperative to selectively target only the
tumor-promoting MMPs in vivo (45–48). Recently, a highly
selective anti–MT1-MMP antibody was shown to inhibit
growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a mouse model of
breast cancer (49). Thus, evaluating this antibody in clinical
trials may help address whether selective targeting of MT1MMP blocks PDAC tumor growth and increases response to
chemotherapy.
Overall, we show that the collagen-rich tumor microenvironment limits the effectiveness of gemcitabine through MT1MMP–mediated HMGA2 expression as depicted by our model
(Fig. 7). MT1-MMP is overexpressed in human PDAC tumors,
particularly in areas of fibrosis. We now show that MT1-MMP
expression is associated with increased HMGA2 expression in
human PDAC tumors, suggesting that the pronounced fibrotic
reaction may contribute to gemcitabine resistance through
increased MT1-MMP-HMGA2 signaling. Given that very little
progress has been made in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
targeting MT1-MMP could be a novel approach to sensitize
pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine.
