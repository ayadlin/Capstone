Abstract
We have identified a critical role for amplified FGFR2 in
gastric cancer cell proliferation and survival. In a panel of
gastric cancer cell lines, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
(FGFR2) was overexpressed and tyrosine phosphorylated
selectively in FGFR2-amplified cell lines KatoIII, Snu16, and
OCUM-2M. FGFR2 kinase inhibition by a specific smallmolecule inhibitor resulted in selective and potent growth
inhibition in FGFR2-amplified cell lines, resulting in growth
arrest in KatoIII cells and prominent induction of apoptosis in
both Snu16 and OCUM-2M cells. FGFR2-amplified cell lines
also contained elevated phosphotyrosine in EGFR, Her2, and
Erbb3, but the elevated phosphorylation in EGFR could not be
inhibited by gefitinib or erlotinib. We show that the elevated
EGFR, Her2, and Erbb3 phosphotyrosine is dependent on
FGFR2, revealing EGFR family kinases to be downstream
targets of amplified FGFR2. Moreover, shRNA to Erbb3
resulted in a loss of proliferation, confirming a functional
role for the activated EGFR signaling pathway. These results
reveal that both the FGFR2 and EGFR family signaling
pathways are activated in FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer cell
lines to drive cell proliferation and survival. Inhibitors of
FGFR2 or Erbb3 signaling may have therapeutic efficacy in the
subset of gastric cancers containing FGFR2 amplification.

Introduction
Gastric cancer is second to lung cancer as the most lethal cancer
worldwide (1) and can be classified as a well-differentiated
intestinal subtype or as a poorly differentiated diffuse subtype
(2). Whereas overall gastric cancer incidence has declined, the
incidence remains high in Asian countries including Japan, Korea,
and China (1, 3). Diffuse gastric cancer is associated with a less
favorable prognosis relative to the intestinal subtype, but for gastric
cancer overall, the prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival rates in
the range of 10% to 15% (4, 5). An exception to this poor survival is
observed in clinical practice in Japan, where a combination of
screening and aggressive surgical intervention has resulted in
5-year survival rates approaching 60% (4, 6). Despite these efforts,
late-stage gastric cancer continues to have a dismal prognosis, and
thus there remains an urgent need for improved therapy.

Multiple oncogenic alterations have been described in gastric
cancer. These include a relatively low incidence of ras mutations
(7, 8), loss-of-function mutations in the E-cadherin gene CDH1 (9),
as well as amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases Her2, Met, and
FGFR2 (10–12). Interestingly, these alterations are associated with
specific subtypes of gastric cancer. Whereas Her2 amplification
(13) and ras mutations (14, 15) are found in the well-differentiated
intestinal subtype, CDH1 mutation as well as Met and FGFR2
amplification occurs more frequently in the undifferentiated diffuse
subtype (9, 12, 16, 17). Interestingly, in an analysis of matched
primary and metastatic tumor samples, FGFR2 amplification in
some cases occurred only in a metastatic lesion, suggesting a role
for this kinase in the development of metastases (18).
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a member of the
FGFR receptor tyrosine kinase family, which consists of 4 receptors
and 23 ligands (19). Ligand binding leads to FGFR2 dimerization,
autophosphorylation, and activation of signaling components
including Akt and Erk kinases. FGFR2 was originally identified as
an amplified DNA sequence from the gastric cancer cell line KatoIII
(18, 20), and subsequent efforts identified FGFR2 amplification in
3% to 10% of primary gastric cancers (12, 16, 21). A role for FGFR2
in cancer is supported by the observation that transgenic
expression of the FGFR2-specific ligand FGF7 (KGF) leads to
prostate hyperplasia and mammary adenocarcinoma (22). In
addition, activating mutations in FGFR2 have been described in
primary gastric cancer (23). Despite these observations, a role for
FGFR2 in oncogenesis has not been widely accepted, and evidence
also exists that FGFR2 is down-regulated and may have a growth
suppressive role in some cancers (24). As well, with regard to
FGFR2 amplification, it remained unclear whether FGFR2 or
neighboring genes in the 10q26 locus were contributing factors for
gastric cell transformation. Recent work using multikinase smallmolecule inhibitors has provided evidence that in cell lines
expressing FGFR2, the kinase can be required for cancer cell
proliferation (25, 26). However, the small-molecule inhibitors used
in these studies inhibit multiple kinases in addition to FGFR2,
raising the possibility that inhibition of a combination of kinases is
required for growth inhibition.
We used both a highly specific FGFR inhibitory small molecule
and FGFR2 shRNA to define a critical role for FGFR2 amplification
in gastric cancer cell growth. In KatoIII, Snu16, and OCUM-2M cell
lines, FGFR2 amplification results in a highly overexpressed and
constitutively phosphorylated receptor. FGFR2 inhibition by shRNA
or a small-molecule inhibitor induced potent and selective growth
inhibition and apoptosis in these cell lines. Interestingly, elevated
tyrosine phosphorylation in epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), Erbb3, and Her2 was found in FGFR2-amplified cell lines.
This elevated phosphorylation was resistant to inhibition by either
gefitinib or erlotinib but was abrogated on FGFR2 kinase
inhibition, revealing EGFR family members to be downstream

components of FGFR2 signaling in FGFR2-amplified cell lines.
shRNA inhibition of Erbb3 inhibited growth in FGFR2-amplified
lines, and thus the FGFR2-mediated activation of Erbb3 is essential
for proliferation. We conclude that the activated FGFR2 kinase in
FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer cells stimulates proliferation and
survival through activation of multiple signaling pathways
including a novel transactivation of EGFR family members. As
well, our results suggest that FGFR2 inhibition may have
therapeutic efficacy in the subset of poorly differentiated gastric
cancers containing FGFR2 amplification.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. KatoIII, Snu16, AGS, 23132/87, Snu1, N87, MKN45, and Snu5
were from American Type Culture Collection. NUGC4, OCUM-1, and IM95
were from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Japan Health
Sciences Foundation). Cells were maintained in RPMI plus 10% FCS and
100 Ag/mL penicillin-strep (Sigma). IM95 medium contained 10 mg/L
insulin. GTL-16 cells were a gift from S. Giordano and P.M. Comoglio
(University of Torino Medical School, Torino, Italy). OCUM-2M cells were
from Osaka City University (Osaka, Japan).
Quantitative PCR analysis of FGFR2 genomic amplification.
Genomic DNA was purified with the DNeasy kit protocol per manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). Primers and probe used for FGFR2 qPCR are listed
5¶ to 3¶: F-CCCCCTCCACAATCATTCCT, R-ACCGGCGGCCTAGAAAAC, and
VIC-TCGTCTAGCCTTTTCTTTT-MGBNFQ. Primers and probe for singlecopy reference gene RNase P were from Applied Biosystems, as was TaqMan
Universal PCR reagent mix (4324018). Reactions were done in quadruplicate
with genomic DNA at 2.5 ng, primers at 900 nmol/L, and probes at
250 nmol/L under standard thermocycling conditions (2 min at 50jC,
10 min at 95jC, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95jC, and 1 min at 60jC). Data were
normalized to RNase P and then to the calibrator sample (normal stomach
genomic DNA, BioChain Institute D1234248).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. KatoIII gastric carcinoma
cells were treated with colcemid at 0.02 Ag/mL for 3 h and DNA fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) was done as previously described (27, 28) using
bacterial artificial chromosome clones RP11-62L18 and RP11-20J15 containing FGFR2 as probes. Probes were directly labeled using Spectrum Orange
dUTP and Spectrum Green dUTP (Abbott Molecular, Inc.).

BbsI and 3¶ SpeI used to clone into a proprietary ENTR plasmid (mouse
U6 promoter) followed by conversion to Plenti6/Block-iT-DEST (Invitrogen) using Gateway (Invitrogen). Erbb3 shRNAs in PLKO-1 from Open
Biosystems were E8, RHS3979-9630819; E9, RHS3979-9630819; and E10,
RHS3979-9630819. Controls from Sigma included SHC001, a vector control,
and SHC002, a PLKO-1 nontargeting control that activates the RNAinduced silencing complex and the RNAi pathway but does not target a
human transcript. Virus production and titer determination were as
directed by the supplier. Lentiviral infection was at a multiplicity of
infection of 10 to 20. For growth analysis, cells were seeded at 4,000 per
well in 96-well plates, whereas for Western blot analysis cells were seeded
at 40,000 per well in 12-well plates. Viral supernatants were added for 20 h
in the presence of 8 Ag/mL polybrene, at which point viral supernatants
were removed and replaced with growth medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum.
Compound treatment of cell lines. A 10 mmol/L solution of PD173074
(Sigma) was diluted in DMSO in a 96-well plate to create a dilution series of
compound at 1,000 concentration: 100, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2 Amol/L. Two
microliters of each stock solution were removed to separate wells using a

www.aacrjournals.org

multichannel pipettor and diluted with 200 AL of DMEM/0.5% FCS. Finally,
11 AL of this dilution were added to triplicate wells containing target cells in
100-AL growth medium. After 3 d, cell numbers were quantitated using the
Vialight reagent (Vialight assay kit, Cambrex). For some assays, independent
analysis by cell counting on a hematocytometer confirmed the results of
Vialight. Luminescence was quantified with a Topcount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer) and IC50 determinations made by using logistic four-parameter
curve fitting. For quantitation of phosphotyrosine in FGFR2 and EGFR
family members, blots were scanned and quantitated using ImageQuant
software. Values corresponding to band intensity were plotted against drug
concentration to establish an IC50 of drug inhibition. Gefitinib and erlotinib
were purchased from the Beth Israel Hospital pharmacy. Profiling of 224
independent kinases was done through the KinaseProfiler service at Upstate
Biotechnologies.
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, antibodies, and growth
factors. Lysates were prepared in 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, 30 mmol/L NaPPi, 1% Triton X-100,
0.5% Igepal, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L vanadate, 1 mmol/L bpPhen
(Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor (Roche), and Western blotting and
immunoprecipitation were as described (29, 30). The following antibodies
were from R&D Systems: FGFR2 (MAB6841), phospho-FGFR2 (AF3285),
EGFR (AF231), Her2 (AF1129), Erbb3 (AF234), and Erbb4 (AF1131).
Antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology were FGFR2 (sc-122), phosphoFGFR2 (3471), Y1289 Erbb3 (4791), Y845 EGFR (2231), AKT (9272), pAKT 473
(4058), extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk; 9102), pErk (4370),
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; 9542), and h-actin (4967) antibodies.
Y1173 EGFR antibody was from Biosource Invitrogen. Anti–glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Fitzgerald Industries. 4G10
phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate. Recombinant EGF and FGF7
were from R&D Systems.
Ras activation assays. Ras activation was assayed on 400-Ag cell lysates
with a ras activation kit (Upstate) according to kit procedures.
Flow cytometry. A Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur was used for flow
cytometry on 500,000 cells. Nonadherent cells were included in the analysis.
Cells were fixed overnight in 1-mL ice cold 70% ethanol, then washed in PBS
and stained with propidium iodide/RNase (BD PharMingen) for 3 h. ModFit
software was used to determine relative distribution in G1, S, and G2-M, and
manual gating to determine sub-G1 content.
Receptor tyrosine kinase array. Array 001 was from R&D Systems and
was used according to the supplier’s protocols as previously described (29).
Fifty micrograms of cell lysates were used for the experiments.
Sequencing. Ras isoform and FGFR2 sequencing was done at Transgenomic Labs.

Results
FGFR2 is overexpressed and activated in FGFR2-amplified
cell lines. We assembled a panel of 10 gastric cancer cell lines and
investigated FGFR2 expression and activation in relationship to
FGFR2 genomic amplification. KatoIII, Snu16, and OCUM-2M have
been reported to contain elevated FGFR2 gene copy (12, 31, 32). To
confirm this result, we developed a quantitative genomic PCR assay
that identified high-level FGFR2 gene copy in KatoIII, OCUM-2M,
and Snu16 cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined the genomic
amplification status of FGFR2 in KatoIII cells by FISH analysis
using FGFR2 and chromosome 10 centromeric region specific
probes. FISH analysis revealed prominent clustered, large FGFR2
signals consistent with homogeneous staining regions in both
metaphase and interphase nuclei of KatoIII cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1, arrowheads). This high-level FGFR2 amplification was
distinct from the endogenous FGFR2 gene locus, suggesting a
targeted amplification of this locus (Supplementary Fig. S1, arrow).
We next confirmed that FGFR2-amplified KatoIII, OCUM-2M,
and Snu16 cell lines expressed high levels of FGFR2 protein
(Fig. 1B). Both KatoIII and OCUM-2M express COOH-terminally

Figure 1. FGFR2 amplification leads
to FGFR2 overexpression and activation
in Snu16, KatoIII, and Ocum2M cells and

A, FGFR2 is highly amplified in Snu16,
KatoIII, and Ocum2M cell lines.
Quantitative PCR was done on genomic
DNA from the indicated cell lines as

RNase P was used as an internal reference

and 60-Ag protein lysate (prepared
according to Materials and Methods) was
subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with antibodies recognizing
FGFR2, FGFR2 activation loop
phosphorylation Y653/654, and GAPDH.
For phospho-tyrosine detection, lysates

MAB6841 as described in Materials and
Methods, separated by SDS-PAGE, and
Western blotted for phosphotyrosine with
the 4G10 antibody. C and D, downstream

truncated splice variants resulting in the lower molecular weight
kinase in these cells relative to Snu16 (32). Consistent with a
truncation in the COOH terminus, a FGFR2 COOH-terminal
reactive antibody (sc-122) does not detect FGFR2 from KatoIII
and OCUM-2M cells, but does detect FGFR2 from Snu16 cells (data
not shown). We similarly found very low expression of FGFR2 in
the Met-amplified cell lines MKN45, GTL-16, SNU5, and HS746T
(data not shown).
High basal levels of FGFR2 activation site phosphorylation
were found in the cell lines overexpressing FGFR2, although both
KatoIII and OCUM-2M contained higher basal activation relative to Snu16 (Fig. 1B). The basal phosphorylation was further
stimulated by FGF7 in Snu16 cells, but only marginally in
KatoIII and OCUM-2M. Because the Y653/654 phosphospecific
FGFR antibody cross-reacts with FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4
(data not shown), we tested the FGFR2 activation status by
FGFR2 immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine detection with

4G10. Consistent with elevated activation site phosphorylation,
Fig. 1B reveals that total phosphotyrosine is highly elevated in the
FGFR2-overexpressing cell lines. Similar to the Y653/654 site, total
FGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation is significantly stimulated by
FGF7 addition only in the Snu16 cell line. However, the basal
phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in Snu16 cells was not stimulated
by FGF7 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that basal FGFR2 activation is
sufficient to activate the mitogenic signaling pathways in this
cell line. As well, the lack of Akt and Erk activation by FGF7 in
the nonamplified cell lines is consistent with the undetectable
levels of FGFR2 in these lines (Fig. 1B). Ras was also found to be
activated in FGFR2-amplified cells, and again FGF7 did not result in further activation in Snu16 (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, ras
activation in FGFR2-amplified cell lines can be similar to levels
seen in the ras mutant AGS and Snu1 cells (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2). Also of note, sequencing revealed that ras
isoforms are wild-type in KatoIII, Snu16 (33), and OCUM-2M cells

(data not shown), and thus ras activation is likely a result of
constitutive receptor signaling.
To address the mechanism of FGFR2 activation, we determined
if the high basal phosphorylation in FGFR2 was due to activating
mutations described in craniofacial syndromes as well as in a
subset of primary gastric cancer (23, 34). However, complete
sequencing of FGFR2 in KatoIII, Snu16, and OCUM-2M did not
reveal mutations (data not shown). Finally, conditioned media from
KatoIII or OCUM-2M cell lines did not activate FGFR2 phosphorylation in Snu16 (data not shown). Thus, the observed FGFR2
activation is likely due to dimerization as a result of receptor
overexpression.
FGFR2 kinase activity is required for proliferation of FGFR2amplified cell lines. Although FGFR2 is highly activated, it
remained to be determined if FGFR2 kinase activity is required for
gastric cancer cell growth. A Merck multikinase inhibitor
compound in clinical development5 inhibited multiple serine/
threonine and tyrosine kinases (including FGFR2) and inhibited the
growth of FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer cell lines (data not
shown). However, it was not clear whether a combined inhibition
of multiple kinases was required for growth inhibition or whether
specific FGFR2 inhibition alone was sufficient. Therefore, we used
the FGFR-selective inhibitor PD173074 for further experiments
(35). This compound was found to inhibit FGFR kinases in vitro at
an IC50 of 3.6 nmol/L for FGFR1, 3.3 nmol/L for FGFR2, and
5.3 nmol/L for FGFR3 (data not shown). To confirm selectivity for
FGFR, we found that this compound significantly inhibited only
FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 (but not FGFR4) of 224 kinases tested
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We note that inhibition of the CAMKIIg
isoform was not linear.
Having established PD173074 as a potent and selective inhibitor
of FGFR activity in vitro, we found that this compound also
potently inhibited FGFR2 phosphorylation in cells (Fig. 2A), with
IC50 values from 7 to 13 nmol/L (Fig. 2B). PD173074 inhibition of
FGFR2 phosphorylation was correlated with a strikingly potent and
selective growth inhibition in the FGFR2-amplified cell lines
(Fig. 2B). The average IC50 for growth inhibition of three FGFR2amplified lines was 18 nmol/L, whereas the average for 10
nonamplified lines was 4,200 nmol/L, a difference of >200-fold in
potency. Importantly, the similar IC50 for biochemical inhibition of
FGFR2 phosphorylation and growth inhibition strongly implicates
FGFR2 phosphorylation as the activity required for cell growth.
These results reveal that the overexpressed and highly activated
FGFR2 kinase is the key driver of proliferation in FGFR2-amplified
cell lines.
We were interested to determine if the FGFR2-amplified cell
lines might be nonspecifically sensitive to a variety of receptor
tyrosine kinase or chemotherapeutic inhibitors. However, gefitinib and erlotinib were not potent growth inhibitors of FGFR2amplified cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 6,000 to
8,500 nmol/L in KatoIII cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), and combination treatment of PD173074 and gefitinib did not improve the
potency of either compound treatment alone (data not shown).
Gefitinib function was confirmed by inhibition of the NUGC4 cell
line at an IC50 of 125 nmol/L (data not shown), similar to
previously reported inhibition (36). Regarding chemotherapeutic
compounds, paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil had relatively similar

potency against FGFR2-amplified cells in comparison with non–
FGFR2-amplified cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
FGFR2 shRNA inhibits cell growth. Although PD173074 is
highly selective for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, we additionally
treated cells with shRNA directed to FGFR2 to confirm its role in
cell growth. We infected FGFR2-amplified cell lines with FGFR2
shRNA using lentiviral vectors and achieved efficient FGFR2
knockdown in OCUM-2M and KatoIII cells with shRNAs F2 and
F3, but not with F1 and F4 (Fig. 3A). By contrast, we were unable to
decrease FGFR2 protein in Snu16 cells. Using lentivirally expressed
green fluorescent protein, we found that Snu16 cells were not
efficiently infected even at much higher multiplicity of infection

Figure 2. PD173074 inhibits FGFR2 phosphorylation and selectively inhibits
growth of FGFR2 -amplified cell lines. A, PD173074 inhibits FGFR2
phosphorylation. Cells were treated for 1 h with a titration of PD173074
(in nanomolar) as described in Materials and Methods. Lysates were prepared
and 150 Ag of protein were immunoprecipitated with MAB6841, separated on
SDS-PAGE, and blotted for phosphotyrosine with 4G10. The blot was stripped
and reprobed for total FGFR2. The experiment was repeated thrice with
similar results. B, PD173074 inhibits cell growth. Cell lines were plated
at 4,000 cells per well and incubated overnight. Cell lines were treated with
a titration of PD173074 (in nanomolar) as described in Materials and Methods;
after 3 d, relative cell numbers were determined with Vialight reagent.
The IC50 values for growth inhibition are listed with SD and are results from
four separate experiments. Also listed are the IC50 values (in nanomolar) for
FGFR2 phosphotyrosine inhibition as determined by quantitation of data

We note that only Ocum2M, Snu16, and KatoIII cells contain measurable
FGFR2 phosphorylation.

(data not shown). In OCUM-2M and KatoIII cells, FGFR2
knockdown by F2 and F3 was accompanied by growth inhibition,
whereas the F1 and F4 shRNAs and a luciferase shRNA were not
growth inhibitory (Fig. 3B). The non–FGFR2-amplified cell line AGS
was not growth inhibited with F1, F2, F3, F4, and luciferase
shRNAs. To address the poor infectivity of Snu16 cells, we selected
for stable expression of FGFR2 shRNA with blasticidin. Stable lines
could be established with all FGFR2 shRNA constructs, but
Western blotting revealed no decrease in FGFR2 protein (data

not shown), and thus shRNA treatment was uninformative for
FGFR2 function in Snu16 cells. However, KatoIII and OCUM-2M
show growth inhibition with F2 and F3 shRNAs, confirming the
inhibition seen with PD173074.
FGFR2 -amplified cell lines undergo growth arrest or
apoptosis after inhibition of FGFR2. To understand the
mechanisms of growth inhibition in PD173074-treated cells, we
analyzed the cell cycle distribution in KatoIII, OCUM-2M, and
Snu16 by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with 100 nmol/L

or pretreated with 2 Amol/L gefitinib (Iressa) for 1 h before EGF addition (I/EGF ), or treated directly with 2 or 10 Amol/L of gefitinib for 2 h (2I and 10I , respectively).
After treatment, lysates were prepared and 200-Ag protein was immunoprecipitated with the EGFR antibody AF231. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and probed for phosphotyrosine. Representative of two experiments.

PD173074, and cell cycle distribution was analyzed at 24, 48, and
72 hours after drug addition. In all cell lines, 24 hours of drug
treatment resulted in a strong (3- to 4-fold) decrease in S phase
(Fig. 4A). In addition, both OCUM-2M and Snu16 revealed a 4-fold
increase in the sub-G1 cell population. This sub-G1 fraction, which
is suggestive of apoptosis, increased further by 72 hours to include
>50% of the cell population (Fig. 4A). By contrast, even at the
72-hour time point, KatoIII cells had only a minor sub-G1
population. Visual inspection of Snu16 and OCUM-2M cells after
72 hours of drug treatment revealed a profound loss of cell integrity
in OCUM-2M and Snu16 cells, whereas KatoIII cells remained
intact (Supplementary Fig. S6 and data not shown). Treatment of
OCUM-2M with shRNAs F2 and F3 also resulted in a similar loss of
cell integrity (data not shown). As a further test for apoptosis, we
probed for cleaved PARP, a marker of caspase activation associated
with apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Prominent induction of cleaved PARP
could be seen as early as 24 hours after addition of PD173074 in
both Snu16 and OCUM-2M cells. By contrast, KatoIII cells showed
no induction of cleaved PARP, consistent with flow cytometry
results. Thus, FGFR2 inhibition can result in dramatically different
growth arrest phenotypes.

The growth suppression resulting from FGFR2 inhibition was
likely due to loss of multiple signaling pathways after inhibitor
treatment. To test this, we analyzed Erk and Akt phosphorylation
as well as activation of ras after treatment of cell lines with
PD173074 (Supplementary Fig. S7). Erk and Akt phosphorylation
and ras activation were blocked in KatoIII, OCUM-2M, and Snu16
cells at increasing drug concentrations after 2 hours of treatment.
Akt has been reported to become reactivated after EGFR inhibitor
treatment of Her2-amplified cells at later time points (37). However,
Akt phosphorylation remained inhibited in KatoIII cells at 48 and
72 hours of treatment with 40 and 100 nmol/L of PD173074 (data
not shown). Whereas ras activity remained elevated in KatoIII cells
after 2 hours of drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7), at 6 and
24 hours, loss of ras activation was similar to that seen in Snu16
and OCUM-2M cells (data not shown).
FGFR2 activates EGFR family members in FGFR2-amplified
cell lines. Met amplification in lung and gastric cancer cell lines
results in activation of EGFR family members (29, 30). A receptor
tyrosine kinase array revealed that FGFR2-amplified lines also
contain activated EGFR family members (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We immunoprecipitated EGFR and Erbb3 from our cell line panel

and probed for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5A), confirming activated
EGFR and Erbb3 in FGFR2-amplified cell lines as well as in Her2amplified (N87) or gefitinib-sensitive (NUGC4) cell lines. Interestingly, EGFR and Erbb3 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated
similarly in FGFR2-amplified cells and the Her2-amplified cell line
N87. Using EGFR phosphospecific antibodies, we found that the
Y845 activation site is constitutively phosphorylated, whereas the
Y1173 docking site remains ligand inducible (data not shown). As
well, Erbb3 Y1289 is phosphorylated in KatoIII and OCUM-2M, but
not in Snu16 (data not shown). We tested Her2 activation and
found that only KatoIII contained significant phosphotyrosine in
Her2, whereas phosphotyrosine was not recovered from Erbb4 in
any cell line (Fig. 5B and data not shown). A striking observation
was that phosphorylation of Erbb3 and EGFR in Snu16 cells was
stimulated by FGF7. Because FGF7 is a dedicated ligand for FGFR2
(19), this result suggested that FGF7 indirectly activated Erbb3 and
EGFR via activation of FGFR2.
If EGFR family members are components of amplified FGFR2
signaling, loss of FGFR2 would result in loss of EGFR family
phosphorylation. This was confirmed as PD173074 treatment
inhibited EGFR, Erbb3, and Her2 phosphorylation at concentrations similar to those required to inhibit FGFR2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 5B and C). shRNA inhibition of FGFR2 also resulted in loss of
Tyr1289 phosphorylation in Erbb3 (Supplementary Fig. S10). We
conclude that EGFR family members are downstream targets of the
amplified and highly activated FGFR2 kinase.
Erbb3 is required for proliferation of FGFR2-amplified cell
lines. We treated cells with gefitinib to test EGFR function in FGFR2amplified cell lines. Surprisingly, 10 Amol/L gefitinib did not inhibit basal EGFR phosphorylation in these three cell lines (Fig. 5D).
Erlotinib at 10 Amol/L also failed to block EGFR phosphorylation
(data not shown). Gefitinib activity was confirmed by its ability

to block the dramatic EGF-mediated stimulation of EGFR in Snu16
cells (Fig. 5D, compare lanes EGF and I/EGF). As discussed above,
gefitinib and erlotinib are poor inhibitors of KatoIII, OCUM-2M,
and Snu16 proliferation, which is consistent with the observed lack
of EGFR phosphorylation inhibition. Although EGFR was highly
activated by EGF addition to Snu16 cells, both OCUM-2M and
KatoIII had only a minor increase in EGFR phosphorylation,
suggesting that the basal EGFR phosphorylation in KatoIII and
OCUM-2M represents a near-maximal receptor activation.
Because gefitinib was unable to block EGFR phosphorylation, we
tested a functional role for EGFR pathway activation in KatoIII,
OCUM-2M, and NUGC4 cells using shRNA to Erbb3, a required
partner for EGFR family signaling. Each of three shRNAs directed
to Erbb3 resulted in efficient knockdown of Erbb3 protein (Fig. 6A).
Growth of both KatoIII and OCUM-2M was inhibited by Erbb3
shRNA, but only minor growth inhibition was observed in the
NUGC4 cell line, which also has highly activated Erbb3 (Fig. 6B).
Analysis of signaling after Erbb3 ablation revealed that both
KatoIII and OCUM-2M have a loss of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation,
consistent with known Erbb3 signaling through the Akt pathway
(Fig. 6A). In OCUM-2M cells, both FGFR2 and Erk phosphorylation
remained elevated after Erbb3 knockdown. Because Erbb3 shRNA
did not induce cell death in OCUM-2M cells, as was observed with
PD173074 treatment or FGFR2 knockdown (Fig. 6B, and data not
shown), it is possible that signal transduction through activated
Erk or FGFR2 accounts for survival in Erbb3-deficient OCUM-2M
cells. In contrast to OCUM-2M, in KatoIII cells FGFR2 phosphorylation was reduced after Erbb3 knockdown, and this reduction
was strongest with shRNA1 (Fig. 6A). As well, Erk phosphorylation
was consistently inhibited with shRNA1. The FGFR2 phosphorylation that remains after shRNA2 and shRNA3 treatment may be
sufficient to maintain Erk phosphorylation. The increased potency

FGFR2 Dependence of Gastric Cancer Cell Lines

of shRNA1 to inhibit Erk and FGFR2 phosphorylation is currently
not explained. As well, the molecular mechanism that results in
reduction of FGFR2 phosphorylation in KatoIII cells relative OCUM2M cells remains to be identified. However, we conclude that Erbb3
is a functional component of FGFR2-amplified cell growth.

Discussion
A key finding of this work is that FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer
cell lines are dependent on the overexpressed and activated FGFR2
kinase for growth. Interestingly, in Snu16 and OCUM-2M cells, loss
of FGFR2 resulted in apoptosis, whereas in KatoIII cells the loss of
FGFR2 signaling resulted in growth arrest without apoptosis.
Withdrawal of 100 nmol/L PD173074 from KatoIII cells after 7 days
of treatment resulted in rapid outgrowth of cells (data not shown),
confirming that compound-treated KatoIII cells are viable and
capable of cell cycle reentry. In each of the FGFR2-amplified cell
lines, there was a loss of Erk, Akt, and ras activation after FGFR2
inhibition. Recent work suggested that Akt may become reactivated
at later time points following receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
treatment, possibly contributing to drug resistance (37). However,
Akt remained inhibited in KatoIII cells after 48 and 72 hours of
PD173074 treatment, and thus the survival pathways that are active
in KatoIII cells after FGFR2 inhibition remain to be identified.
A striking finding is that FGFR2-amplified cell lines contain
elevated EGFR and Erbb3 phosphorylation (and in KatoIII cells,
Erbb2 phosphorylation) that is dependent on FGFR2 kinase
activity. Cross talk between FGFR2 and EGFR family kinases is
also supported from our finding that the FGFR2-specific ligand
FGF7 stimulated EGFR and Erbb3 phosphorylation in Snu16 cells.
Importantly, EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR in Snu16
cells is not inhibited by PD173074 (Supplementary Fig. S9), and
thus only the elevated basal phosphorylation in EGFR family
members is FGFR2 dependent. Therefore, the dramatic phenotype
associated with FGFR2 inhibition is a result of the combined loss of
FGFR2 and EGFR family signaling.
shRNA inhibition of Erbb3 revealed that EGFR family signaling is
required for cell growth in KatoIII and OCUM-2M cells. The FGFR2EGFR interaction described here parallels recent reports that
amplified Met can coactivate EGFR family signaling in lung cancer
(29, 30). We find similar EGFR activation in Met-amplified gastric
cancer cell lines (data not shown). Together these results reveal
that Met- and FGFR2-amplified cell lines activate EGFR family
proteins for cell transformation. The functional interaction
between FGFR2 and EGFR family kinases could be mediated by a
physical interaction, and thus we carried out coimmunprecipita-

tion experiments in KatoIII, Snu16, and OCUM-2M cells. We used
NH2- and COOH-terminal antibodies under varying degrees of
stringency, immunoprecipitating with either FGFR2 or Erbb3 and
blotting for the converse protein. However, we were unable to show
a specific interaction. Thus, a physical relationship between FGFR2
and Erbb3 remains to be identified.
The inability of gefitinib or erlotinib to block basal phosphorylation in EGFR is also consistent with a model in which amplified
FGFR2 activates EGFR family members. FGFR2 is not inhibited
by gefitinib and is therefore able to maintain elevated EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib. This result also cautions
against the use of phosphorylated EGFR to stratify gastric or lung
cancer patients for EGFR small-molecule inhibitor therapy because,
in a subset of these patients, EGFR is activated by FGFR2 or Met and
will be resistant to EGFR inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, because
Met amplification activates an EGFR signaling network that is
resistant to gefitinib (29, 30), FGFR2 amplification may be yet
another mechanism of clinical gefitinib resistance.
Because Met, FGFR2, and Her2 amplification and ras mutations
are exclusive of each other in gastric cancer cell lines, it is likely
that each oncogene can independently activate transformed
growth. The genetic defect in these cell lines can correlate with
the specific inhibitor required to inhibit cancer cell growth. For
example, Met-amplified cell lines SNU5, GTL-16, and MKN45 are
insensitive to FGFR2 inhibition but are potently inhibited by Met
inhibition (data not shown; ref. 38). Conversely, FGFR2-amplified
cell lines are insensitive to Met-specific small-molecule inhibitors
(data not shown) but are sensitive to FGFR2 inhibition. Finally, the
NUGC4 (EGFR/Erbb3 activated; Fig. 6) and Her2-amplified N87 cell
lines (39) are selectively inhibited by EGFR inhibitors or Herceptin,
respectively (36, 40). It remains to be tested whether gastric cancers
harboring these genetic alterations will be similarly responsive in a
clinical setting. If this is the case, these studies along with those of
others are beginning to define a rational treatment strategy for the
subset of gastric cancers with activated/amplified receptor tyrosine
kinases.
