Cytotoxicity in Cancer Cells Treated With
Fluorescent Nanoparticles
Evan S. Glazer, MD1 and Steven A. Curley, MD1,2

BACKGROUND: Nonionizing radiation, such as radiofrequency field and near infrared laser, induces thermal cytotoxicity in cancer cells treated with gold nanoparticles. Quantum dots are fluorescent semiconducting nanoparticles that
were hypothesized to induce similar injury after radiofrequency field irradiation. METHODS: Gold nanoparticles and 2
types of quantum dot (cadmium-selenide and indium-gallium-phosphide) conjugated to cetuximab (C225), a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-1, demonstrated concentration-dependent
heating in a radiofrequency field. The authors investigated the effect of radiofrequency field exposure after targeted
nanoparticle treatment in a coculture of 2 human cancer cell lines that have differential EGFR-1 expression (a highexpressing pancreatic carcinoma, Panc-1, and a low-expressing breast carcinoma, Cama-1). RESULTS: Radiofrequency
revealed that Panc-1 or Cama-1 cells not containing gold nanoparticles or quantum dots had a viability of >92%. The
viability of Panc-1 cells exposed to the radiofrequency field after treatment with 50 nM Au-C225 was 39.4%  8.3%
without injury to bystander Cama-1 cells (viability was 93.7%  1.0%; P  .0006). Panc-1 cells treated with targeted
cadmium-selenide quantum dots were only 47.5% viable after radiofrequency field exposure (P<.0001 compared with
radiofrequency only Panc-1 control cells). Targeted indium-gallium-phosphide quantum dots decreased Panc-1 viability to 58.2%  3.4% after radiofrequency field exposure (P ¼ .0004 compared with Cama-1 and Panc-1 controls).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors selectively induced radiofrequency field cytotoxicity in Panc-1 cells without injury to
bystander Cama-1 cells using EGFR-1–targeted nanoparticles, and demonstrated an interesting bifunctionality of fluoC 2010 Amerirescent nanoparticles as agents for both cancer cell imaging and treatment. Cancer 2010;116:3285–93. V

Nanoparticle -based photodynamic therapy for cancer has been primarily focused on near-infrared radiation,

because many nanoparticles absorb and release heat at these wavelengths.1,2 These therapies are limited to superficial
lesions, as near-infrared radiation transmission through tissue is minimal.3 Other forms of electromagnetic radiation,
including nonionizing radiofrequency field radiation, penetrates through biologic tissues readily and without significant
toxicity.4
We have previously reported on the use of noninvasive radiofrequency fields to induce thermal cytotoxicity in
human and mammalian cancer cells exposed to targeted solid gold nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes.5,6 Cancer cells
endocytose cell surface receptor-specific antibody-conjugated nanoparticles with subsequent intracellular heat release during shortwave radiofrequency field treatment sufficient to produce cellular cytotoxicity.5 The radiofrequency treatment
device consists of a transmitting plate connected to a radiofrequency power generator with a second grounded plate that
together capacitively couple samples in a focused radiofrequency field. Gold nanoparticles heat in a concentration- and
size-dependent linear fashion in this radiofrequency field.7

Original Article

Theranostic nanoparticles, such as fluorescent nanocrystals (ie, quantum dots), are a category of nanoparticles
that are fundamentally changing the way cancer is
detected and treated.8 Such nanoparticles can be targeted
to malignant cells via antibody or peptide conjugation
and can be used for optical imaging or as a marker for
other therapeutic cargo.9-11 Quantum dots in the far red
region of the visible spectrum permit visualization of in
vivo targets.12 Typically, quantum dots consist of a metal
core (5 nm diameter) with an inorganic shell to improve
quantum yield.13,14 Common components of these cores
include cadmium-selenide (CdSe) or indium-galliumphosphide (InGaP). Polyethylene glycol (PEG), other
polymers, proteins, or chemical hydroxylation are often
used to prolong circulating time in vivo and to decrease
potentially toxic metal ion release (ie, cadmium).15-18
In this work, we investigated an in vitro model of
mixed cell populations to determine whether targeting
selected cells with antibody-conjugated quantum dots or
20-nm gold nanoparticles followed by radiofrequency
field treatment would kill the targeted cancer cells without
injuring bystander cells. Human Panc-1 cells, a pancreatic
carcinoma cell line, overexpresses epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)-1 that can be targeted with cetuximab
(C225), a monoclonal antibody raised against this cell
surface receptor. A human breast carcinoma cell line,
Cama-1, minimally expresses EGFR-1,5 and it represents
the bystander or nontargeted cells.
We hypothesized that 1) like gold nanoparticles,
quantum dots would heat in a 13.56-MHz radiofrequency field; and 2) targeting nanoparticles (gold or
quantum dots) to cancer cells would result in thermal
injury or death to targeted cells after radiofrequency field
treatment without substantial effect on bystander cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines, Cell Culture, Antibodies, Quantum
Dots, Gold Nanoparticles, and Fluorophores
Cell lines Panc-1 and Cama-1 were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va) and
incubated in standard growth conditions (37 C, 5%
CO2). During the experiment, all cultures were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, Va) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were performed in standard 60-mm culture dishes
or 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). The cell
line identities were confirmed by the Characterized Cell

3286

Line Core service (STR DNA fingerprinting, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
Tex, April 2009). Trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA; Mediatech) released cells from the cell culture dishes; 0.5 mg/mL collagenase I (Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, Calif) was added to the trypsin-EDTA solution
to free cells from the 96-well plates.
Cetuximab (C225) was purchased from Bristol-Myers
Squibb (New York, NY). Twenty-nanometer spherical gold
nanoparticles were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. (Redding,
Calif). Antibody conjugation kits for CdSe-based quantum
dots Qdot605 and Qdot705, and the fluorophore Alexa
Fluor 647 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif).
The InGaP-based quantum dot eFluor NC700 was purchased from eBioscience, Inc. (San Diego, Calif). CdSebased quantum dots Qdot605 and Qdot705 emit peak fluorescence at 605 nm and 705 nm, respectively.13 InGaP
eFluor NC700 quantum dots emit peak fluorescence at
680 nm.19 All contain a zinc-sulfide shell and PEG coating
with a final hydrodynamic diameter of 20 nm, similar to
the gold nanoparticles used.20,21 Quantum dots act as both
the identification and therapeutic agent, and a fluorophore
(Alexa Fluor 647) conjugated to C225 acted as the identifying fluorescent agent for all gold nanoparticle experiments.
All standard laboratory chemicals, including those
required for antibody conjugation per instructions in each
kit, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis,
Mo) or Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, Mass)
unless otherwise stated.
Conjugation of Cetuximab to Quantum Dots
and Gold Nanoparticles
Cetuximab was conjugated to Qdot605, Qdot705, and
eFluor NC700 nanoparticles according to the manufacturer’s instructions (noted above). Antibody-quantum
dot conjugate concentrations were determined as recommended by measuring the absorbance with a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Finally,
the conjugates were sterilized under ultraviolet light for
15 minutes, a duration not reported to induce significant
release of cytotoxic agents.22
Alexa Fluor 647 was conjugated to cetuximab also
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (noted above),
and that conjugate (C225-Alexa Fluor 647) was subsequently conjugated to 20-nm gold nanoparticles with a
slight modification to a previously published protocol.23
First, the pH of gold nanoparticles stock solution was raised
to approximately 8.5, the isoelectric point of cetuximab.24
Next, 90 lg of C225-Alexa Fluor 647 was slowly added to

10 mL of the modified gold nanoparticles solution. This
was protected from light to prevent fluorophore bleaching
while gently mixing every 15 minutes at room temperature
for 1 hour. Next, it was concentrated 10-fold in a centrifugation filter unit with a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff
(Millipore Corp., Billerica, Mass) at 3500 g. Finally, it was
sterilized under ultraviolet light for 15 minutes.
Generation of Radiofrequency Field and
Antibody-Nanoparticle Conjugate Heating
Samples were placed in a high-voltage, shortwave radiofrequency field (13.56 MHz) produced between 2 metal
electrode plates that capacitively couple the sample plate
in an air gap of 10 cm (Therm Med, LLC, Erie, PA). The
radiofrequency field is on the order of 10 to 15 kV/m at
400 to 800 W of power.7 Teflon, a material with low radiofrequency field absorbance, is used to hold samples in
place. Stock solutions of each nanoparticle were diluted
with 18 MX water to determine heating rates (Millipore).
Cells were exposed to the radiofrequency field for 5
minutes at a generator power of 200 W or for 4 minutes at
250 W as indicated (total energy generated, 1000 Wminutes or 60 kJ). The temperature was continuously monitored with an infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Inc., Boston,
Mass). All media temperatures remained <40.5 C.
Panc-1 Cells Treated With Qdot605-Cetuximab
and Radiofrequency Field Exposure
An aliquot of Panc-1 cells were exposed to 50 nM
Qdot605-cetuximab for 3 hours, and a separate aliquot of
Panc-1 cells were exposed to an equal concentration of
cetuximab only. After exposure, the cells were washed, combined in equal numbers (2  105 cells each) in cell culture
dishes (n ¼ 8), and incubated for 24 hours. At that time,
half of the dishes were exposed to a radiofrequency field for
5 minuets at a generator power of 200 W (n ¼ 4). Another
group of combined cells (n ¼ 4) were not exposed to radiofrequency field treatment. Investigation of viability occurred
48 hours later with flow cytometry.
Mixed Cell Populations Treated With
Cetuximab-Conjugated Nanoparticles
and Subsequently Exposed to A
Radiofrequency Field
An equal number of Panc-1 and Cama-1 cells (3  105)
were plated together in standard 60-mm cell culture
dishes (n ¼ 4). After 24 hours, the cells were treated with
50 nM gold nanoparticles-C225-Alexa Fluor 647 for 3
hours. At the same time, an equal number of Panc-1 and

Cancer

July 1, 2010

Cama-1 cells (2  104) were plated together in 96-well
plates (replicates of 4). The cells in plates were treated
with 50 nM eFluor NC700-C225 or 50 nM Qdot705C225 for 3 hours. After treatment, the media was
exchanged for fresh complete media without conjugates.
Twenty-four hours later, the plates were placed in a radiofrequency field for 5 minutes at a generator power of 200
W (total generator power, 60 kJ). Forty-eight hours later,
flow cytometry was performed. In a similar fashion, mixed
cell populations (n ¼ 4) were also treated with conjugate
concentrations of 30 nM for 3 hours and had a fresh
media exchange, and the cells were exposed 24 hours later
to a radiofrequency field for 4 minutes at 250 W (total
generator power, 60 kJ).
Determination of Targeted Cells
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence
microscopy, and flow cytometry were used to discriminate
between cocultured cells that contained cetuximab-conjugated nanoparticles and those that did not. TEM was performed with a JEM 1010 microscope (JEOL, Inc.,
Peabody, Mass), and images were taken with an AMT
Imaging System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques
Corp., Danvers, Mass). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an Eclipse TE2000 microscope system
(Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) with appropriate
excitation and emission filters (Chroma Technology
Corp., Rockingham, Vt).
Determination of Cell Death in the
Context of Target Identification After
Radiofrequency Therapy
Cell populations were identified with flow cytometry that
had high or low fluorescence of Qdot605, Qdot705,
eFluor NC700, or Alexa Fluor 647 as an identifier (and in
the case of quantum dots, the treatment). Cell death was
determined by 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences,
Inc., San Jose, Calif). Annexin V, a well-characterized
protein that binds to cellular inner membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine exposed during apoptosis, was
provided and conjugated to the fluorophore Horizon
V450 as a kind gift from BD Biosciences.

RESULTS
Production and Internalization of Gold
Nanoparticles-C225
After gold nanoparticles were conjugated to cetuximab-labeled Alexa Fluor 647 (C225-Alexa Fluor 647), there was
a small plasmon resonance shift consistent with conjugation and not consistent with gold aggregation (Fig. 1).
TEM demonstrated gold nanoparticles internalized into
Panc-1 cells (Fig. 1) but not into Cama-1 cells.
Targeting and Identifying Quantum
Dot-Containing Cells
Panc-1 cells demonstrated increased uptake of C225-conjugated quantum dots by fluorescence microscopy, flow
cytometry, and TEM (Fig. 1). The mixed Panc-1 and
Cama-1 cocultured cells and Panc-1–only groups clearly

3288

displayed fluorescence associated with Qdot705-C225,
whereas the Cama-1–only group did not (Fig. 1, red false
color). There was a 10- to 100-fold brighter intensity of
quantum dot-containing cells compared with the negative
population. This permitted discrimination between Panc1 cells with internalized quantum dots or control cells not
containing quantum dots.

One hundred nanomolars C225 antibody alone in deionized water heats at 1.18 C/min  0.13 C/min in the

heated significantly faster, in a concentration-dependent
fashion (P<.05, Fig. 2). One hundred nanomolar gold

Because of the similar components in Qdot605, the
Qdot605-C225 conjugate heated in a similar manner to
Qdot705-C225.

data for each conjugate. DI indicates deionized water.

Radiofrequency Field-Induced Thermal
Cytotoxicity in Panc-1 Cells
Control Panc-1 cells without quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, or radiofrequency treatment had a viability of
99.0%  0.1% (Fig. 3). After a 5-minute radiofrequency
exposure without nanoparticles, the viability decreased to
95.2%  2.2%, as measured 48 hours after exposure.
Treating Panc-1 cells with Qdot605-C225 conjugates
without radiofrequency exposure decreased viability to
82.2%  3.8%. When Qdot605-C225–treated cells were
subsequently placed in the radiofrequency field for 5
minutes, the viability decreased to 47.5%  9.8% (p 
.0001). Furthermore, radiofrequency field exposure of
Qdot605-bearing Panc-1 cells induced cell necrosis,
whereas Qdot605-C225 treatment without radiofrequency field exposure induced apoptotic cell death in a
much smaller fraction of cells, as noted (Fig. 3).
Qdot605-C225 was not used in the mixed cell experiments because it had heating characteristics similar to
Qdot705-C225.
Effects of Nanoparticle Treatment and
Radiofrequency Field Exposure on Mixed Cell
Populations
All subsequent studies with the remaining 3 nanoparticles
conjugated to C225 (gold nanoparticles, Qdot705, eFluor
NC700) were performed in Panc-1 and Cama-1 cells in

exposed to cetuximab-conjugated quantum dots displayed
similar patterns for identification.
Cama-1 cells maintained viability >88% after treatment with cetuximab-conjugated quantum dots and gold
nanoparticles as measured 48 hours after radiofrequency
field exposure (Table 1, Fig. 4). Low-dose treatment (30
nM) of all 3 cetuximab-nanoparticle conjugates decreased
Panc-1 viability to an average of 78% after radiofrequency
field exposure (P<.003). Radiofrequency field treatment
after 50 nM eFluor NC700-C225 yielded a Panc-1 cell viability rate of 58.2%  3.4%, whereas the viability rate
was reduced to 56.3%  3.3% after 50 nM Qdot705C225 treatment followed by radiofrequency field exposure (Table 1). Fifty nanomolar gold nanoparticles-C225Alexa Fluor 647 treatment of mixed cell populations
coupled with subsequent radiofrequency field exposure
reduced Panc-1 viability to 39.4%  8.3% (Table 1, P 

 3.0%, and 92.4%  2.6%, respectively, after treatment
with 50 nM gold nanoparticles-C225-Alexa Fluor 647,
Qdot705-C225, and eFluor NC700-C225 (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
In this model, a noninvasive, nonionizing shortwave radiofrequency field induced a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in malignant human cells first treated with
antibody-targeted nanoparticles. We demonstrated that
the cell-specific intracellular hyperthermia caused minimal toxicity to bystander cells that did not take up the
EGFR-targeted nanoparticles. Interestingly, the gold
nanoparticles-C225-Alexa Fluor 647 treatment induced
the greatest cell death after a single radiofrequency field
exposure. We suggest that intense heat release during radiofrequency field exposure in the nanoscale environment
immediately around each nanoparticle dominates the cellular killing effect through protein denaturation and disruption of cellular membranes.25 Measuring bulk
temperatures only approximates the heat transfer from the
nanoparticle to the surrounding intracellular environment. At the intracellular level, most likely a relatively low
concentration of nanoparticles will be sufficient to induce
irreparable injury if structures requisite for cell viability
(ie, nucleus, mitochondria, intact cell membrane) are
severely damaged or destroyed. This is consistent with the

interesting finding that Qdot705-C225 and gold nanoparticles-C225 not only heat much faster than eFluor
NC700-C225, but they also induce a predominately necrotic radiofrequency-induced effect, whereas the eFluor
NC700-C225 conjugates were associated with lower rates
of radiofrequency-induced heating that predominately
induced apoptosis (Table 2). As we have demonstrated,
nuances regarding the magnitude of intracellular hyperthermia (media temperatures remained <40.5 C at all
times here) seem to determine whether cellular death is
via apoptotic or necrotic pathways in general.
Although all of the nanoparticles presented here
have a hydrodynamic diameter of 20 nm,20,21 the surface area of the solid gold nanoparticles has more exposure
to the radiofrequency field per particle, because they are
larger than the core of the quantum dots. Although larger
semiconducting nanocrystals will fluoresce in the very far
red to near infrared region, the semiconducting nature of
the particles may permit increased heat dissipation at
larger diameters, whereas gold nanoparticles tend to heat
less when they are greater than 50 nm in diameter.7 In
addition, as the underlying theory requires transfer of
energy to the surrounding intracellular milieu, different
coatings among different nanoparticles may abrogate or
enhance the radiofrequency field-induced heating. Surface coatings and functionalizing molecules are variable
from nanoparticle to nanoparticle and often synthesis
dependent.
The heating rates reported here are not extremely
high (<20 C/min) because of the low generator powers.
This was intentional, to prevent any nonspecific heating
of the media to temperatures >40.5 C. Although prolonged exposure times are required for cell death between

Cancer

July 1, 2010

40.5 C and 43 C, apoptosis begins at these temperatures.4 However, as has been demonstrated here, quantum
dots or gold nanoparticles internalized into cancer cells do
in fact produce sufficient intracellular hyperthermia in
response to the shortwave radiofrequency field exposure
to induce significant cell death after a single treatment.
The cytotoxicity of quantum dots is being investigated, with some types having more potential toxic effects
than others.12,26-28 Qdot605 and Qdot705, for example,
contain a well-known cytotoxic agent, cadmium.
Although the toxicity associated with free cadmium ions
varies with the specific quantum dot and cell under investigation, quantum dot toxicity has been reported at concentrations >0.8 lM.26 In general, in vitro models
suggest that cadmium quantum dot concentrations <100
nM are safely tolerated, and indium-based quantum dots
(ie, eFluor NC700) are 10 less toxic.22,28,29 Although
certain metals (ie, platinum) have become standard treatment for some cancers,30 cadmium toxicities to normal
cells makes cadmium an unattractive option as an anticancer cytotoxic agent. Unfortunately, each type of quantum dot is unique, with its own toxicity profile. The type
of core, shell, and coating all contribute to variations in
release of free ions that may induce cytotoxicity.22
The ideal theranostic agent would not only permit
diagnosis and treatment of cancer cells, but also permit
multimodality treatment without injury to bystander
cells. Although multiple agents can be conjugated to a single nanoparticle, the use of quantum dots permits 1 less
conjugation because of the bifunctionality of fluorescence
and local nanoscale hyperthermia in a radiofrequency
field. This is a potentially important new finding and an
addition to the multifunctionality of quantum dots,

nanocrystals, or other fluorescent nanoparticles. These
types of nanoparticles have already been used for in vitro
and in vivo optical imaging in animal models of malignant cells, including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer.31-33 Including other elements in the core or shell
structure, such as iron, gadolinium, or gold, may allow
the nanoparticles to be used for optical and radiographic
imaging with magnetic resonance or computed tomographic scans.33 Some fluorescent nanoparticles can bind
to specific proteins, creating the potential to measure circulating serum or intracellular protein levels.34 Plasmoncoupling can be used to observe specific base pair mismatches or mutations in DNA using thiolated DNA
probes linked to gold nanoparticles because of specific
surface-enhanced Raman scattering.35 Functionalization
and enhancement of circulating half-life of fluorescent
nanoparticles can be achieved by linking PEG, proteins,
silica, or other biocompatible polymers to the fluorescent
core.31,33,36 Targeting molecules, including antibodies,
peptides, or pharmacologic agents, can also be arrayed on
the surface to promote cell-specific binding and uptake.
This may permit targeted delivery of drugs, silencing
RNA, or other therapeutic agents to malignant cells with
successful delivery confirmed by noninvasive optical
imaging. We have shown in this study that the intrinsic
fluorescence of quantum dots and nanocrystals is useful
in flow cytometric analysis and identification of specific
cell populations. Heat release during radiofrequency field
exposure in these semiconducting quantum dots and
nanocrystals has not previously been reported, and this
opens yet another potential therapeutic use for fluorescence nanoparticles. Cetuximab is an excellent antibody
for in vitro models because of the variation in EGFR-1
expression of different cancer cell lines; however, it
would be a poor choice in human trials, as EGFR-1 is
constitutively expressed in many normal tissues, but
overexpressed in a minority of cancers.37 A major challenge in cancer therapy is to identify cellular targets that
are uniquely expressed only on malignant cells. This goal
has yet to be fully realized. However, as antibody, drug,
and peptide binding to cancer-specific targets identified
through genetic and proteomic analyses38,39 becomes
more specific, using bifunctional fluorescent nanoparticles may permit diagnostic and treatment options that
are noninvasive and minimally toxic.
