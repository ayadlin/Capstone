Abstract
The imatinib paradigm in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) established continuous BCR-ABL inhibition
as a design principle for ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, clinical responses seen in patients treated
with the ABL TKI dasatinib despite its much shorter plasma half-life and the apparent rapid restoration of BCRABL signaling activity following once-daily dosing suggested acute, potent inhibition of kinase activity may be
sufﬁcient to irrevocably commit CML cells to apoptosis. To determine the speciﬁc requirements for ABL TKIinduced CML cell death for a panel of clinically important ABL TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, and
DCC-2036), we interrogated response of CML cell lines and primary CML cells following acute drug exposure
using intracellular ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting and immunoblot analyses of BCR-ABL signaling, apoptosis
measurements, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry of intracellular drug levels, and biochemical
TKI dissociation studies. Importantly, signiﬁcant intracellular TKI stores were detected following drug washout,
levels of which tracked with onset of apoptosis and incomplete return of BCR-ABL signaling, particularly pSTAT5,
to baseline. Among TKIs tested, ponatinib showed the most robust capacity for apoptotic commitment showing
sustained suppression of BCR-ABL signaling even at low intracellular levels following extensive washout,
consistent with high-afﬁnity binding and slow dissociation from ABL kinase. Together, our ﬁndings suggest
commitment of CML cells to apoptosis requires protracted incomplete restoration of BCR-ABL signaling
mediated by intracellular retention of TKIs above a quantiﬁable threshold. These studies reﬁne our understanding of apoptotic commitment in CML cells and highlight parameters important to design of therapeutic
kinase inhibitors for CML and other malignancies. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3356–70. 2013 AACR.

and development efforts of additional TKIs in CML (1–5) and
other cancers (6, 7) have emulated and attempted to improve
upon imatinib's favorable speciﬁcity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics properties. Among those properties, the rationale
behind dosing requirements for TKIs has received recent
attention. Preclinical studies with imatinib established concentrations of at least 1 mmol/L sustained for at least 16 hours
as threshold conditions for irreversibly committing CML cell
lines to apoptotic death (8). Coupled with subsequent data
from phase I clinical trials of imatinib, which identiﬁed a
plasma half-life of approximately 18 hours and found significant responses in patients with plasma trough levels greater
than 1 mmol/L (9), the imatinib paradigm suggested continuous complete BCR-ABL inhibition as a design principle for
ABL TKIs.
In contrast, preclinical and subsequent clinical evaluation of
the second-generation ABL TKI dasatinib found impressive,
durable responses with once-daily dosing regimens, despite a
much shorter plasma half-life (3–5 hours) and rapid restoration of BCR-ABL activity in vivo (10, 11). A further phase III
comparison of once- versus twice-daily dasatinib in CML
revealed comparable cytogenetic and molecular response

Intracellular Drug Retention Mediates Apoptosis Commitment in CML

rates, with the beneﬁt of reduced incidence of toxicity with
the once-daily schedule (12). The ﬁnding that clinical efﬁcacy can be maintained despite only transiently inhibiting
BCR-ABL signaling opens an opportunity to study the
mechanistic requirements for ABL TKI-induced CML cell
death.
We and others have previously shown commitment of CML
cells to apoptosis following potent, transient target inhibition
with ABL TKIs in vitro (13–15), although differences between
concentrations required to produce this effect and their relative activity against BCR-ABL kinase suggest potential
involvement of previously unrecognized factors. One hypothesis, referred to as the oncogenic shock premise, holds that
intense, temporary disruption of BCR-ABL activity sets up a
kinetic imbalance between prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling favoring the latter, the consequence of which is irreversible commitment to apoptosis (16, 17).
We report a mechanistic evaluation encompassing transient
exposure of CML cells to a panel of U.S. Food and Drug
Administration-approved ABL TKIs [imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib (AP24534; refs. 2, 18), as well as DCC-2036
(rebastinib), which is entering phase II trials (3, 19)]. After
transient exposure of the cells to each of these agents, we
interrogate response using multiparameter intracellular
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunoblot
analyses, apoptosis measurements, liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), and biochemical
dissociation studies of ABL from ABL TKIs. In aggregate, our
ﬁndings reveal that attenuated restoration of BCR-ABL
signaling correlates with apoptosis commitment and that
intracellular retention of ABL TKIs above a quantiﬁable
threshold is a critical, previously unrecognized parameter
mediating this effect.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors
All inhibitors were prepared as 10 mmol/L stock solutions in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 20 C. Serial dilutions of stock solutions were carried out just before use in each
experiment.
Cell lines
Certiﬁed BCR-ABL–positive human CML blast crisis–
derived K562 (American Type Culture Collection) and
LAMA-84 cells (DSMZ) were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 U/mL penicillin G, and 1 mg/mL
streptomycin (complete media) at 37 C and 5% CO2. Neither of
the cell lines used in this study was cultured for longer than 6
months from initial purchase or characterization. No further
authentication of cell lines characteristics was done.
Collection of patient samples
Clinical samples were obtained with informed consent and
under the approval of the Oregon Health & Science University
(OHSU) Institutional Review Board. Bone marrow from
patients was separated on a Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare)
for isolation of mononuclear cells.

Inhibitor washout protocol for CML cell lines
K562 and LAMA-84 cells (5  105/mL) were incubated in
complete media alone or with dasatinib (10 or 100 nmol/L),
ponatinib (10 or 100 nmol/L), nilotinib (500 or 5,000 nmol/L),
imatinib (500 or 5,000 nmol/L), or DCC-2036 (500 or 5,000
nmol/L) for 2 hours at 37 C. Following drug exposure, cells
were subjected to a series of 1 of 2 types of wash steps:
resuspension in fresh inhibitor-free complete media only
(quick wash) or resuspension in fresh media followed by a
5-minute incubation at 37 C (long wash). The standard washout protocol [deﬁned to match our previously reported studies
(13)] consisted of 2 quick washes followed by 1 long wash step.
The expanded washout protocol involved an additional 5 wash
steps (alternating long and quick washes) beyond the standard
washout. Samples for apoptosis and inhibitor LC/MS-MS
analyses were collected from each treatment condition at the
end of the 2-hour exposure, immediately following standard
washes, and immediately following extra washes. Samples for
immunoblot and FACS analyses were collected before and at
multiple time points following standard and expanded
washout.
Inhibitor washout protocol for primary CML cells
Mononuclear cells (5  105 cells/mL) from patients with
CML were incubated in complete media (supplemented with
100 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol) alone or with ABL TKIs (same
concentrations as for cell line protocol above) for 4 hours at
37 C. Following drug exposure, cells were subjected to the
standard or expanded washout protocol (identical to those
conducted in cell lines). Samples for apoptosis and inhibitor
LC/MS-MS analyses were collected from each treatment condition at the end of the 4-hour exposure and immediately
following standard and expanded washout. Samples for immunoblot and FACS analyses were collected at the end of the 4hour exposure and at 24 hours after standard and expanded
washout.
Apoptosis assay
At each relevant time point within the washout protocols
described earlier, cells from each treatment condition were
plated in triplicate in a 96-well plate (5  104/well), incubated
at 37 C, and apoptosis was measured at 72 hours after the start
of the experiment using the Guava Nexin assay (Millipore).
Results are reported as the mean percentage Annexin Vpositivity; error bars represent SEM.
Immunoblot analysis for CrkL phosphorylation
For CML cell lines, cells were collected for each treatment
condition at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, and 36 hours after either
standard or expanded washout (as described earlier) and lysed
(5  105 cells/30 mL) in boiling SDS-PAGE loading buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for
10 minutes. All lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with anti-CrkL antibody C20 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CrkL
forms were distinguished on the basis of differential band
migration, and band signal intensities were quantiﬁed by
densitometry on a Lumi Imager (Roche) and expressed as

percentage phosphorylated CrkL [calculated as (pCrkL)/
(pCrkL þ non-pCrkL)  100%].
Phosﬂow analysis
For CML cell lines, cells were collected for each treatment
condition at the end of the 2-hour drug exposure and at 0, 0.5,
2, 4, and 8 hours after either standard or expanded washout (as
described earlier). For experiments involving primary CML
mononuclear cells, where sufﬁcient cell numbers were available, samples were collected at the end of the 4-hour drug
exposure and at 24 hours after standard and expanded washout (see above protocol). Samples were prepared by incubating cells (1  106) in Cytoﬁx buffer (BD) at 37 C for 15 minutes
and resuspending in PBS (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
DMSO for storage at 80 C before analysis. Upon thawing
of samples, ﬁxed cells were permeabilized with Perm Buffer III
(BD) for 30 minutes on ice. Samples were stained for pCrkL
(Alexa647) and pSTAT5 (Alexa488) and analyzed using a Canto
II instrument (BD) and FlowJo or FCS Express (De Novo
Software).
Detection of inhibitors by LC/MS-MS
For CML cell lines, cellular and media fractions were separated by centrifugation for each treatment condition at the
end of the 2-hour drug exposure, immediately following standard and expanded washout (as described earlier), and at 2
hours after the expanded washout. For experiments involving
primary CML mononuclear cells, where sufﬁcient cell numbers
were available, cellular and media fraction samples were
collected at the end of the 4-hour drug exposure and
immediately following standard and expanded washout.
Cellular fraction lysate samples were prepared by washing
cells (1  106) once with PBS, resuspending in hypotonic lysis
buffer [5 mmol/L Tris, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L EGTA in
double-distilled water (ddH2O); pH 7.0], shearing with a 27gauge needle, and incubating on ice for 15 minutes. Samples
were spun down and clariﬁed lysates isolated. All samples
(both cellular and media fractions) were stored at 80 C
before analysis. Amounts of dasatinib, ponatinib, nilotinib,
imatinib, and DCC-2036 in cellular and media fractions were
determined by LC/MS-MS using an adaptation of the method of Haouala and colleagues (20); for full details, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Brieﬂy, samples were
thawed and extracted in acetonitrile containing internal
standard (sorafenib) and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX 5500QTRAP triple–quadrupole hybrid linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Compounds were quantiﬁed
using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Results for intracellular inhibitor levels are reported in ng per 1  106 cells
and concentrations of inhibitor in media are reported in
nmol/L.
ABL kinase inhibitor dissociation studies
The rate of dissociation of dasatinib, ponatinib, nilotinib,
imatinib, and DCC-2036 from ABL kinase was determined
using the LanthaScreen Eu Kinase Binding Assay (Life Technologies); staurosporine was also included as a control. For
full details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods. Brieﬂy,

full-length puriﬁed, recombinant His-tagged ABL kinase protein (either unaltered or tyrosine dephosphorylated) was preincubated with a biotin-labeled anti-His-tag antibody and
Europium chelate-labeled streptavidin in saturating concentrations of dasatinib, ponatinib, nilotinib, imatinib, DCC-2036,
or staurosporine for 2 hours at room temperature. This mix
was subsequently diluted into solution containing excess of
Alexa647-labeled kinase ligand (Kinase Tracer 178), where
dissociation of the inhibitor is followed by rapid binding of
tracer. Upon tracer binding, productive time-resolved ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) signal was measured over time using a PHERAStar Plus instrument (BMG
Labtech) to establish dissociation curves. Off-rate data are
reported as t1/2 values in hours.

Results
Commitment of BCR-ABL–positive cells to apoptosis
following acute exposure to ABL TKIs is not fully
explained by relative potency for BCR-ABL inhibition
We established a 2-tier washout system (Fig. 1A) to evaluate
whether acute exposure to ABL kinase inhibitors is necessary
and sufﬁcient to irrevocably commit BCR-ABL–positive cells to
apoptosis. In line with previous reports from our laboratory
and others, continuous exposure of K562 cells to dasatinib at 10
or 100 nmol/L resulted in substantial onset of apoptosis as
measured by percentage of Annexin V–positive cells (Fig. 1B;
refs. 13, 14). Implementation of our previously established in
vitro standard washout procedure after 2 hours of exposure to
dasatinib, designed to emulate the clinical situation of acute
dasatinib exposure (serum half-life: 3–5 hours; ref. 13), abolished onset of apoptosis for cells treated with 10 nmol/L
dasatinib but only slightly diminished the extent of apoptosis
induced in 100 nmol/L dasatinib-treated cells compared with
continuous exposure (Fig. 1B).
Although dasatinib's short 3- to 5-hour plasma half-life is
in sharp contrast to that of other clinically available ABL TKIs
(t1/2 > 15 hours; refs. 9, 21), the variation in potency, target
selectivity, and drug-binding properties among these different
inhibitors provides a valuable means for further interrogating
the mechanisms responsible for apoptotic commitment following acute ABL TKI exposure in CML cells. Dasatinib and
ponatinib represent highly potent, multikinase TKIs, whereas
nilotinib, imatinib, and DCC-2036 are less potent TKIs with
reduced off-target kinase proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S1; refs.
2, 3, 22). Thus, we carried out parallel washout experiments at
physiologically relevant concentrations to examine the properties of each of these 5 clinically relevant ABL TKIs with
respect to triggering of apoptosis. Among these, ponatinib is
approximately equipotent with dasatinib as an ABL TKI (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 2), suggesting that if absolute potency
against BCR-ABL were the sole determinant of irrevocable
commitment to apoptosis, the 2 TKIs would be expected to
elicit similar concentration-dependent levels of apoptosis.
However, we found acute exposure to 10 or 100 nmol/L
ponatinib followed by standard washout resulted in minimal
or no reduction in apoptosis, respectively, compared with
continuous exposure at these same concentrations (Fig. 1B).

These differences between dasatinib and ponatinib were also
observed for a second BCR-ABL–positive cell line (LAMA-84;
Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Consistent with previous studies (13, 15), experiments
involving the less potent, more restricted kinase off-target
proﬁle ABL TKI nilotinib conﬁrmed a pattern of concentration-dependent commitment to apoptosis similar to dasatinib
following standard washout protocol (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
imatinib- and DCC-2036–induced apoptosis returned to
approximately baseline levels observed in untreated cells
following standard washout conditions even at high concentration (5,000 nmol/L); similar results and trends were
obtained using LAMA-84 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Notably, DCC-2036 is roughly comparable with nilotinib in terms
of relative potency against BCR-ABL (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 19, 23).
The intriguing differences in apoptosis-triggering capacity
between TKIs with nearly identical equimolar potency against
BCR-ABL led us to hypothesize that these distinct properties
could potentially be attributable to fortuitous off-target effects
that reinforce ABL TKI effectiveness in a multifactorial way or
to differences in the extent of TKI removal from the cells

following implementation of the same standard washout
protocol. To investigate whether differences not addressed by
the standard washout protocol could be discerned, an expanded washout protocol consisting of 5 additional wash steps
beyond the standard 3 washouts was implemented (Fig. 1A).
Strikingly, when the additional expanded washout protocol
was applied to K562 cells initially treated with 100 nmol/L
dasatinib, a moderate reduction in the extent of apoptosis
was achieved (Fig. 1B). This was also true for 10 nmol/L
ponatinib and 5,000 nmol/L nilotinib, where apoptosis
levels were reduced to background levels matching the
untreated control. In contrast, levels of apoptosis in cells
treated with 100 nmol/L ponatinib were unaffected by
inclusion of the expanded washout steps (Fig. 1B). Similar
results and trends were obtained for LAMA-84 cells (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3A). These results suggest that a
pool of drug remains sequestered within CML cells following
acute exposure, and in the case of exposure to 100 nmol/L
ponatinib, these levels remain above a threshold required
to induce maximal apoptosis even after implementing the 2tier washout protocol. Taken together, these data suggest that
commitment of CML cells to apoptosis following acute

Comparison of signaling events following acute exposure to

Figure 2. BCR-ABL signaling activity is not fully restored to baseline levels in treatment/washout conditions of dasatinib and ponatinib that commit cells to
apoptosis. K562 cells were incubated alone or in the presence of 10 and 100 nmol/L dasatinib or ponatinib for 2 hours, subjected to standard and expanded
washout, and collected at the indicated time point after washout for analysis by immunoblot (A) and Phosﬂow FACS analyses (B). For immunoblot
analyses, the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of CrkL were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted using a total CrkL antibody, and results are
expressed as percentage pCrkL with the red dashed line indicating the level of percentage pCrkL in untreated K562 cells. For Phosﬂow FACS analyses, cells
were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and stained using Alexa647-pCrkL- and Alexa488-pSTAT5–conjugated antibodies. Results are displayed, for comparison
purposes, as the overlaid signal peak traces of isotype control, untreated cells, and each indicated time point after washout. Vertical, black dashed lines
highlight the peak signal in untreated K562 cells for reference.

Intracellular Drug Retention Mediates Apoptosis Commitment in CML

treatment followed by standard washout resulted in less rapid
return of pCrkL signaling to levels approaching those of
pretreatment. In all cases, the 2-tier washout gave more
consistent, slightly higher levels of pCrkL restoration compared with the standard washout protocol (though differences
were not dramatic), with the substantial recovery of pCrkL
signal occurring as early as the 2 hours after washout time
point. Although pCrkL signaling differences were slight for the
standard versus expanded washout for 100 nmol/L dasatinib
(Fig. 2A), given the apparent difference in the extent of apoptosis (Fig. 1B), we more quantitatively explored the relationship between even slightly attenuated signal restoration and
extent of apoptosis using intracellular FACS analysis of pCrkL
and pSTAT5. The tyrosine-phosphorylation status of STAT5
provides a more sensitive surrogate measure of extent of BCRABL signaling restoration (25), and by extension, is a better
indicator than pCrkL for low levels of residual TKI. Importantly, we found pSTAT5 signal in the 100 nmol/L dasatinibtreated cells showed a greater degree of restoration at every
time point after expanded washout than the corresponding
standard washout time point (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Table S1), and yet signal was never fully restored, consistent
with results in Fig. 1B.
In the case of ponatinib, pCrkL signal was only partially
reduced (25%–50% of pretreatment levels) following 2 hours
treatment at a concentration of 10 nmol/L, whereas 100 nmol/L
treatment inhibited pCrkL signal to essentially undetectable
levels by immunoblot (Fig. 2A). Upon washout under the
standard or expanded protocol, limited restoration of pCrkL
levels was achieved in cells treated with 10 nmol/L ponatinib
despite substantial reduction in the extent of apoptosis in the
case of the expanded washout compared with the standard
washout protocol. Once again, however, this subtle difference
was most discernible in the levels of pSTAT5 (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Table S1). In marked contrast to ﬁndings for
dasatinib, upon washout of 100 nmol/L ponatinib under the
standard or expanded protocol, minimal restoration was
observed as monitored by pCrkL immunoblot or FACS measurements of intracellular pCrkL and pSTAT5 (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that TKI cannot be
washed out readily and that BCR-ABL remains inhibited.
Exposure of K562 cells to nilotinib for 2 hours resulted in
near complete pCrkL signal blockade with 500 nmol/L and
complete interruption with 5,000 nmol/L, although substantial
restoration of pCrkL was only apparent in cells treated with 500
nmol/L nilotinib following standard washout protocol as
gauged by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). Consistent with
apoptosis data, the expanded washout protocol resulted in
pCrkL levels approximating pretreatment levels as judged by
FACS for both concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). In contrast to
nilotinib but consistent with our earlier apoptosis ﬁndings,
acute exposure to either 500 or 5,000 nmol/L imatinib showed
minimal or partial interruption of pCrkL signal, respectively,
which was subsequently restored to levels at or near pretreatment following standard and expanded washout protocols
(Fig. 3A); complete restoration was apparent for both pCrkL
and pSTAT5 by FACS (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S1).
Finally, despite showing signiﬁcant signal blockade at the end

www.aacrjournals.org

of drug exposure, cells treated with 500 nmol/L DCC-2036
showed rapid and complete restoration following both wash
regimens. However, cells treated with 5,000 nmol/L DCC-2036
showed similar trends in signaling inhibition as nilotinib. The
extent of signaling recovery after standard washout conditions
was considerably greater for DCC-2036 than for nilotinib by
immunoblot and FACS (Fig. 3), consistent with differences in
apoptotic commitment (Fig. 1B). Similar results and trends
were seen using LAMA-84 cells (Supplementary Figs. S2A and
S2C and S3A and S3C). Together, these ﬁndings suggest that
apoptotic commitment in CML cells tracks with incomplete
restoration of BCR-ABL signaling and, for certain TKIs, can be
rescued with a more thorough washout protocol, implicating
drug retention properties of ABL TKIs as a mediator of this
effect.
ABL TKIs are retained intracellularly following drug
washout and intracellular TKI levels track with
apoptosis and signaling inhibition
The potential existence of a functionally important, difﬁcultto-remove residual intracellular drug pool has major consequences for inhibitor design. To detect and quantitatively
determine the amount of residual TKI present in CML cells
following acute drug exposure, we developed a highly sensitive
LC/MS-MS-based assay for each of the 5 ABL TKIs under
investigation and collected intracellular and media fractions
for evaluation. This analysis revealed dramatic variance in
levels of retained TKI in K562 cells among the 5 inhibitors
following both standard and expanded washout after acute
drug exposure (Fig. 4A, left). For 10 nmol/L dasatinib treatment, intracellular levels were 0.06 and 0.04 ng/106 cells after
standard and expanded washout protocols, respectively (Fig.
4A, left), and these both corresponded with background levels
of apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells exposed for 2 hours to
100 nmol/L dasatinib showed intracellular levels of 0.56 and
0.35 ng/106 cells after standard and expanded washout protocols, respectively, with both conditions associated with
concentration-dependent increased levels of apoptosis (Fig.
1B). Further regression analysis of the association between
intracellular TKI levels after washout and levels of apoptosis
revealed a nonlinear, concentration-dependent relationship
consistent with intracellular TKI levels above a critical threshold being necessary for commitment to apoptosis (Fig. 4B).
Thus, the LC/MS-MS technique is capable both of establishing
a threshold for onset of apoptosis and of quantitating and
distinguishing differences in amounts of functionally important residual TKI.
Given ponatinib's pronounced capacity for inducing apoptosis and for sustaining marked inhibition of BCR-ABL signaling despite extensive drug washout, ponatinib intracellular
drug retention was compared with dasatinib (which features
comparable molecular weight and potency for BCR-ABL to
that of ponatinib), revealing multiple differences. First, despite
a 10-fold difference in initial exposure concentration, results
with 10 nmol/L ponatinib treatment were similar to those
achieved with 100 nmol/L dasatinib: ponatinib intracellular
levels were 0.24 and 0.14 ng/106 cells following standard and
expanded washout, respectively (Fig. 4A, left), with the latter

and only minimally restored BCR-ABL signaling (Figs. 1B
and 2).
Among the 3 tested less potent, more selective ABL TKIs,
K562 cells most readily retained imatinib following standard
and expanded washout of 5,000 nmol/L treatment (Fig. 4A,
left), although given the approximately 5- to 20-fold reduced
potency of imatinib compared with either nilotinib or DCC2036 (Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 19, 23), these intracellular
levels of imatinib were not sufﬁcient to induce signiﬁcant
apoptosis above background (Figs. 1B and 4B). Comparison
of nilotinib and DCC-2036 also highlighted fundamental differences in the properties of these 2 inhibitors in that treatment with 5,000 nmol/L of either TKI resulted in equal
amounts of drug retained after standard washout (Fig. 4A,
left), yet only nilotinib under these conditions resulted in
substantial apoptosis (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, intracellular
nilotinib levels were markedly reduced after expanded versus
standard washout (0.03 vs. 0.59 ng/106 cells, respectively),
which tracked with abrogation of apoptosis induction. Similar
intracellular TKI retention ﬁndings were obtained with all
tested inhibitors using LAMA-84 cells (Supplementary Figs.
S2B and S3B). These ﬁndings suggest that either the majority of
the residual TKI pool retained within a CML cell following
washout is not bound to BCR-ABL or that auxiliary, off-target
kinase pathways may also help mediate commitment to
apoptosis.
To rule out the possibility that, either by equilibration with
intracellular stores and/or despite extensive washout and
several cycles of media and tissue culture plastic ware
exchange, the media still contained appreciable concentrations of TKI sufﬁcient to produce an unrecognized continuous
exposure situation, we determined the minimum media concentration of each TKI sufﬁcient to trigger apoptosis under
continuous exposure conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Thresholds for continuous media concentrations triggering
substantial apoptosis (>50% that for the highest concentration
tested) were: 1 nmol/L dasatinib, 2.5 nmol/L ponatinib, 25
nmol/L nilotinib, 500 nmol/L imatinib, and 50 nmol/L DCC2036. For dasatinib, imatinib, and DCC-2036, TKI in the media
fraction was either not detected or below the lower limit of
quantitation (LLOQ) of the LC/MS-MS-based assay subsequent to either wash protocol (Fig. 4A, right). In conditions
following standard or expanded washout where media TKI was
detected, concentrations were well below the aforementioned
thresholds for triggering substantial apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S4A), consistent with residual intracellular stores serving
as the source of functionally important TKI. In contrast, while
media TKI concentrations detected following washout of lower
treatment concentrations of ponatinib and nilotinib were
below thresholds inducing substantial apoptosis, media levels
of TKI for 100 nmol/L ponatinib and 5,000 nmol/L nilotinib
following standard washout protocol were 6.68 and 25.5 nmol/L,
respectively, likely reﬂecting slow equilibration of high-level
intracellular stores (Fig. 4A, right). Media TKI levels for both
drugs were reduced to below apoptosis-inducing thresholds
after implementing the expanded washout.
The substantial intracellular stores of TKI we observed
following acute drug exposure and the media concentrations

3364

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

of ponatinib and nilotinib detected after standard washout
suggested that drug retained intracellularly may also continue
to leach out of the cells after washout completion. To conﬁrm
this, we also collected intracellular and media fractions from
each treatment condition at 2 hours after completion of the
expanded washout protocol. In every case, intracellular concentration of TKI was decreased relative to that immediately
after washout completion (Fig. 4A, left) and paired with a
concomitant slight increase in TKI levels in the media (Fig. 4A,
right). These data suggest that detectable concentrations of
ABL TKIs in the media following washout are likely attributable to variable kinetics of drug slowly escaping from intracellular stores, possibly as apoptosis takes place.
Primary CML cells show intracellular TKI retentiondependent commitment to apoptosis and highlight
prolonged efﬁcacy of ponatinib
To conﬁrm that our ﬁndings from CML cell lines about
intracellular TKI retention and commitment to apoptosis
extend to primary CML cells, we conducted similar washout
studies using mononuclear cells isolated from patients with
newly diagnosed CML. Absolute levels of apoptosis achieved
with continuous exposure were slightly less in primary cells
compared with those observed with cell lines. Consistent with
trends observed with K562 and LAMA cells, only dasatinib,
ponatinib, and nilotinib triggered substantial apoptosis over
untreated following standard washout, and among these, only
ponatinib (100 nmol/L) induced substantial, though slightly
reduced, levels of apoptosis following the expanded washout
protocol (Supplementary Fig. S5). Also, in register with CML
cell line ﬁndings, levels of each TKI retained intracellularly
were serially reduced following the standard and expanded
washout protocols, which paralleled ultimate rescue of apoptotic commitment for all inhibitors except ponatinib (Supplementary Fig. S5).
On the basis of the informative differences we observed
between equimolar treatments of dasatinib and ponatinib in
cell lines, we further examined this speciﬁc comparison in
washout experiments using primary cells from an additional
patient with newly diagnosed CML (12/209; Fig. 5). Findings
for 10 nmol/L ponatinib mirrored those of 100 nmol/L dasatinib with a modest decrease in apoptosis levels following
standard washout and subsequent return to baseline levels
following expanded washout. Cells treated with 100 nmol/L
ponatinib showed increased levels of apoptosis overall that
were only reduced following expanded washout, and even then
not completely back to baseline (Fig. 5A).
As our previous ﬁndings in K562 and LAMA cells suggested
pSTAT5 represents a more sensitive biomarker for resolving
subtle differences in BCR-ABL signal attenuation and given
that absolute levels of apoptosis following continuous dasatinib or ponatinib treatment in primary CML samples were
slightly lower at 72 hours compared with those seen with CML
cell lines, we focused our FACS-based analysis on pSTAT5
levels. As expected, absolute differences in signal shift were
reduced compared with CML cell lines but trends were consistent, with pSTAT5 inhibition following acute 100 nmol/L
dasatinib treatment (4 hours) partially and fully rescued to

Figure 5. Commitment to apoptosis in primary CML cells depends on intracellular retention and extent of washout of ABL TKIs, underscoring prolonged
efﬁcacy of ponatinib. Mononuclear cells from a patient with newly diagnosed CML (12/209) were incubated for 4 hours in the presence 10 and 100 nmol/L
dasatinib or ponatinib. Cells were collected before washout and following standard and expanded washout and analyzed for apoptosis (A), BCR-ABL signaling
inhibition (B), and residual TKI levels in the cells and culture media (C). Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-positivity at 72 hours after the start
of the experiment, and results represent the mean of 3 replicates  SEM. For Phosﬂow FACS analyses, cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and stained using an
Alexa488-pSTAT5–conjugated antibody. Results are displayed, for comparison purposes, as the overlaid signal peak traces of unstained control, untreated
cells, and 24 hours after standard or expanded washout. Vertical, black dashed lines highlight the peak signal in untreated K562 cells for reference.
Cellular and media fractions were isolated by centrifugation, and cells were washed in PBS and subjected to hypotonic lysis on ice. Clariﬁed intracellular lysate

and culture media samples were analyzed for TKI levels by LC/MS-MS and results are reported as ng/10 cells and nmol/L in media, respectively. n.d., not

pretreatment levels by 24 hours after standard and expanded
washouts, respectively (Fig. 5B, top). In contrast, in cells treated
with 100 nmol/L ponatinib, pSTAT5 remained inhibited at 24
hours after standard washout at levels comparable with those
just before washout under treatment. Levels of pSTAT5
approaching but not quite reaching those of untreated cells
were observed by 24 hours after expanded washout (Fig. 5B,
bottom).
Consistent with the slightly reduced absolute numerical
differences but preserved data trends between CML cell lines
and primary CML cells, we observed slightly increased intracellular retention of ponatinib versus dasatinib, with after
washout reduction in intracellular levels of both TKIs tracking
with varying levels of pSTAT5 signal restoration and apoptosis
(Fig. 5C). Notably, even intracellular levels of ponatinib as low
as 0.05 ng/106 cells after washout were sufﬁcient to induce a
substantial increase in apoptosis; in contrast, this threshold for
dasatinib was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher after washout
(Fig. 5C). Taken together, these ﬁndings validate the relationship between apoptotic commitment, intracellular retention of
ABL TKIs, and incomplete restoration of BCR-ABL signaling in
primary patient cells and suggest that among the inhibitors

www.aacrjournals.org

tested, ponatinib shows the most robust prolonged efﬁcacy
extending to intracellular levels of drug below the apoptosistriggering thresholds of all 4 other ABL TKIs. This may suggest
that a higher proportion of retained ponatinib is bound to
BCR-ABL target than for other inhibitors.
Differences in kinase: inhibitor dissociation rates among
ABL TKIs largely parallel acute exposure apoptosis
trends
We observed through sensitive LC/MS-MS-based assays and
apoptotic quantitation in both CML cell lines and primary
CML cells that (i) different ABL TKIs are retained intracellularly to different extents after washout, and (ii) comparable
intracellular amounts of approximately equipotent TKIs with
respect to BCR-ABL do not ensure comparable apoptotic
induction. One possible factor contributing to the variability
in degree of washout efﬁciency between different TKIs is
differences in binding properties of each TKI to the BCR-ABL
kinase domain, with the presumption that kinase-bound inhibitor is less readily washed out of the cells. To explore this
question, we used a TR-FRET-based assay (see Materials and
Methods) to evaluate relative rates of dissociation of all 5 ABL

TKIs from puriﬁed ABL kinase (26). Among these inhibitors,
imatinib and ponatinib represented the 2 extremes of very fast
and extremely slow off-rates, respectively (Fig. 6), with ponatinib's remarkably long residence time proﬁle resembling that
of irreversible kinase inhibitors. Dasatinib, nilotinib, and DCC2036 dissociation kinetics were intermediate between imatinib
and ponatinib. Differences in dissociation rates were observed
between the catalytically active and inactive conformations of
the ABL kinase domain, consistent with previously characterized crystallographic-binding evidence for each compound
(3, 27). These ﬁndings suggest that certain ABL TKIs, most
notably ponatinib, may remain bound to BCR-ABL kinase for
long periods following acute drug exposure, enabling prolonged intracellular retention, and partial signal disruption
after washout.

Discussion
The clinical success of the TKI paradigm in CML has
motivated analogous strategies for many malignancies. As
such, the ability of dasatinib to induce durable responses with
once-daily dosing despite a much shorter plasma half-life than

3366

imatinib (3–5 vs. >18 hours) and subsequent rapid restoration
of BCR-ABL activity (10, 11) has prompted investigation into
the mechanistic requirements for ABL TKI-induced CML cell
death.
In vitro drug washout protocols have previously shown
apoptotic commitment in CML cells following acute exposure to ABL TKIs despite only transient inhibition of BCRABL activity (13–15). Among the potential explanations
offered for this phenomenon is the oncogenic shock
hypothesis, which holds that temporary disruption of prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling sets up a kinetic imbalance that guarantees irreversible commitment to apoptosis
(16, 17). Much like a tightrope walker who loses contact
with the high wire, the cell's fate is sealed upon satisfaction
of a single condition. Enforcement of the concept of oncogenic shock as applied to ABL TKIs requires only that
transient, potent interruption of BCR-ABL signaling is both
necessary and sufﬁcient to irrevocably commit CML cells to
apoptosis.
In our studies in CML cells, the condition of complete
interruption of BCR-ABL signaling was met following 2-hour
exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of all TKIs
except imatinib (at both 500 and 5,000 nmol/L for nilotinib and
DCC-2036; at 100 nmol/L for dasatinib and ponatinib; Figs. 2
and 3), yet this did not result in irrevocable onset of apoptosis
in all cases, particularly following more extensive washout
protocol (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the extent of ABL TKIinduced apoptosis can indeed be modulated following acute,
potent target inhibition, thus calling the oncogenic shock
explanation into question. Moreover, the oncogenic shock
concept implies that levels of BCR-ABL signaling restoration
following acute, potent target inhibition do not alter commitment to programmed cell death. In contrast, we found that
sensitive monitoring of BCR-ABL activity (particularly as measured by levels of pSTAT5; Supplementary Table S1) revealed
an association for all ABL TKIs between incomplete restoration of signaling and increased levels of apoptosis (Figs. 1B, 2,
and 3). Importantly, while previous studies of acute dasatinibinduced cell death reported full (14) or approaching full (13)
restoration of pCrkL levels rapidly following washout, extent of
pSTAT5 signal restoration following washout was not evaluated. Notably, FACS analysis of pSTAT5 and pCrkL in ponatinib-treated cells at 24 hours following washout revealed in
select cases a subpopulation of cells undergoing early apoptosis that showed reduced levels of both phospho-proteins (data
not shown), resulting in a reduction in mean signal for the
sample (Supplementary Table S1). However, we did not
observe this to be a robust difference and this was less
pronounced or not observed for other inhibitors at the same
time point. Given our observations that for select TKI treatment conditions (including 100 nmol/L dasatinib) pCrkL but
not pSTAT5 signal was completely restored following washout
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1), this suggests that STAT5
phosphorylation may serve as a more sensitive metric for
monitoring low level changes in BCR-ABL signaling activity.
Investigation into the source of incomplete BCR-ABL signaling restoration following drug washout revealed varying
levels of TKI retained within CML cells as detected by sensitive

Intracellular Drug Retention Mediates Apoptosis Commitment in CML

LC/MS-MS assay (Fig. 4A). Intracellular levels of TKI were
reduced for all ABL TKIs after our standard washout protocol
and reduced further following expanded washout, which
tracked with rescue of BCR-ABL signaling activity and reduction in apoptosis (Figs. 1B, 2, and 3; Supplementary Table S1).
These ﬁndings provide evidence for a functionally signiﬁcant
pool of residual TKI following drug washout capable of attenuating BCR-ABL signaling, consistent with results for low-level
continuous inhibition of BCR-ABL (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
In addition, the nonlinearity of the relationship between
speciﬁc levels of intracellular ABL TKI and levels of apoptosis
after washout suggests a threshold-based requirement for
triggering apoptotic commitment in CML cells (Fig. 4B). In
fact, for the 3 TKIs for which we observed a capacity for
apoptotic induction following acute drug exposure at the
physiologically relevant concentrations tested (dasatinib,
ponatinib, and nilotinib), we used receiver–operator characteristic (ROC) analysis based on induction of apoptosis comparable with that of continuous drug exposure to help guide
selection of threshold values and found after washout samples
with intracellular TKI levels above these thresholds to have
signiﬁcantly increased levels of apoptosis compared with those
below the threshold (Fig. 4C). For example, standard washout
of 10 nmol/L dasatinib-treated cells apparently reduced the
intracellular stores of TKI below an apoptosis-triggering
threshold (Figs. 1B and 4). In contrast, standard washout
following acute exposure to 10 nmol/L ponatinib or 100
nmol/L dasatinib reduced intracellular TKI to levels approaching but still above such a threshold for each drug, and 100
nmol/L ponatinib-treated cells retained TKI at levels well
above a threshold for apoptosis commitment, such that no
reduction in apoptosis was discernible relative to continuous
ponatinib treatment (Figs. 1B and 4). An inhibitory threshold
that must be exceeded to commit CML cells to apoptosis is
consistent with the oncogenic shock premise. However, our
data suggest that the threshold is not dictated by potent, acute
inhibition of BCR-ABL alone. At minimum, commitment to
apoptosis also requires residual TKI levels sufﬁcient to provide
functionally relevant low-level continuous inhibition of BCRABL signaling.
Although dasatinib is the only 1 of 5 TKIs we tested which
features a short plasma half-life clinically (10, 11), many of the
key ﬁndings from this study were made based on valuable
comparisons with other ABL TKIs. To mimic the plasma
pharmacokinetics of dasatinib for all ABL TKIs examined, our
standard washout protocol was designed, through use of serial
volume exchanges, to reduce initial media TKI levels to femtomolar concentrations, which is well below detection limits of
LC/MS-MS. Thus, while for several treatment conditions
(including 10 nmol/L dasatinib) washout did reduce levels of
TKI in the culture media to undetectable levels, it was somewhat surprising to ﬁnd TKI present at very low concentrations
in the media fraction following washout (Fig. 4, right).
Although in almost all cases these media concentrations of
TKI were alone too low to contribute signiﬁcantly to increased
apoptosis via continuous exposure in K562 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), the 2 exceptions were 100 nmol/L ponatinib and
5,000 nmol/L nilotinib (Fig. 4, right), which showed levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

6.68 and 25.5 nmol/L, respectively. Importantly, media levels of
both drugs were reduced to sub-apoptosis–contributing levels
following expanded washout, suggesting they cannot alone
explain the induction of apoptosis under these conditions (Fig.
4, right and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Furthermore, rather than
inefﬁciency of the drug washout protocol, the low levels of TKI
detected in the media following washout may reﬂect differences in dynamics of cellular drug efﬂux mechanisms in
response to signiﬁcant intracellular levels of each drug (28–
34) and/or differences in subcellular drug sequestration (35).
Indeed, a recent study found that overexpression of the
drug transporters ABCB1 or ABCG2 rescued K562 cells from
apoptosis following exposure to very high concentrations of
imatinib (36). However, while the cellular drug transportermediated uptake and efﬂux of imatinib has been reasonably
well-studied (29, 33), application of these ﬁndings to newer
ABL TKIs including dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib has
been limited because of differences in transporter substrate
speciﬁcity (28, 30–32, 34). Regardless of the speciﬁc transport
mechanisms, our ﬁndings that a measurable decrease in
intracellular TKI levels at 2 hours after the expanded washout
was paralleled by a slight increase in levels of TKI in the media
(Fig. 4A) are consistent with the cells as the source of media
TKI after washout.
Our ﬁndings in CML cell lines of intracellular retention of
ABL TKIs tracking with incomplete restoration of BCR-ABL
signaling and commitment to apoptosis were also observed in
similar drug washout experiments using primary CML cells
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). Although absolute
differences in readouts for apoptosis and pSTAT5 signal were
less than those observed with CML cell lines (Figs. 1B, 2B,
and 3B; and Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2C and S3A and
S3C), all data trends were consistent. We have also previously
shown that a modiﬁed standard washout protocol following
acute exposure of CD34þ CML cells to dasatinib results in
partial reduction in apoptosis and substantial but incomplete
restoration of pCrkL and total phosphotyrosine levels (13).
Prolonged efﬁcacy of ABL TKIs in CML cells following drug
washout seems to be dependent not only on the amount of
drug retained intracellularly but also on the residence time of
the TKI bound to the kinase. Upon comparison of all 5 ABL
TKIs in kinase:inhibitor dissociation studies, we observed
striking differences in off-rate kinetics for different inhibitors
(Fig. 6). Most notably, ponatinib showed extremely slow dissociation from ABL kinase compared with the other inhibitors
(Supplementary Table S2), consistent with increased intracellular retention and prolonged substantial inhibition of BCRABL signaling (Figs. 2 and 4) particularly as compared with
dasatinib (2, 23). Previous crystallographic and in vitro cellular
evidence suggests that the native c-ABL protein is normally
tightly regulated within the cell by autoinhibitory mechanisms
involving the N-terminal SH3, SH2, and cap domains, maintaining the kinase's catalytically inactive conformation (37, 38).
Furthermore, wild-type c-ABL has also been shown to exhibit
greater protein stability than constitutively activated, tyrosine
phosphorylated c-ABL in vitro (half-life: 18 vs. 7 hours, respectively; ref. 39). Interestingly, although imatinib showed very
rapid dissociation from ABL kinase, intracellular levels

retained following either wash protocol were frequently
approximately 3- to 4-fold greater than those for same tested
concentration of nilotinib (Fig. 4A, left), suggesting potential
differences in either drug efﬂux kinetics or subcellular sequestration (35). However, the lack of apoptotic induction even at
these intracellular imatinib levels (Fig. 4B) is likely reﬂective
of the signiﬁcantly reduced inhibitory potency of imatinib
relative to the other tested TKIs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Indeed, it has been previously shown that acute exposure of
CML cells to physiologically nonachievable high concentrations of imatinib in vitro (selected to accommodate the fold
difference in potency for BCR-ABL between dasatinib and
imatinib) is capable of triggering apoptotic cell death
(14, 36). Also intriguing was our observation that DCC2036 exhibited similar off-rate kinetics from ABL kinase to
those of nilotinib (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S2; refs. 19, 23),
though only nilotinib was capable of inducing substantially
increased apoptosis in CML cells following acute drug
exposure (Fig. 1B). One possible explanation is that DCC2036, which binds a unique switch control pocket of ABL
formed during the conformational transition between the
catalytically active and inactive states (3), may initially be
slower to bind BCR-ABL such that the 2- to 4-hour drug
exposure period was insufﬁcient to resolve potential acute
exposure efﬁcacy. In contrast, continuous exposure for 72
hours to 25 to 50 nmol/L DCC-2036 induced substantial
apoptosis in K562 cells over untreated (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). Importantly, however, washout studies conducted
using cells from a CML blast crisis patient harboring a
dominant BCR-ABLT315I mutation revealed decreased retention of dasatinib, nilotinib, and imatinib (in contrast to
relatively unchanged levels of the ABLT315I inhibitors ponatinib and DCC-2036) after standard washout compared with
similar experiments in primary CML cells harboring unmutated BCR-ABL (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6), further
highlighting the importance of drug binding in intracellular
retention.
The ﬁndings of our comprehensive investigation into the
requirements of ABL TKIs to commit CML cells to apoptosis
following acute drug exposure underscore the importance of
intracellular drug residence time. The drive to better understand and exploit the mechanisms of TKI uptake and retention
has received considerable recent attention (4, 28–34, 36, 40–
42). Our ﬁndings provide novel insights into the importance of
previously unrecognized intracellular drug retention threshold
levels required for apoptotic induction and identify ponatinib
as a TKI with a kinase residence time proﬁle reminiscent of
irreversible kinase inhibitors (26, 43). This has particular
application to drug design and development, where currently
many compounds that may feature highly favorable target
speciﬁcity and potency may be excluded from further development clinically based on plasma pharmacokinetic proﬁles.
The oncogenic shock model would suggest that to maximize
efﬁcacy and minimize toxicity the key design features of novel
compounds should be extreme kinase target potency and rapid
clearance from both the plasma and tissues. In contrast, our
ﬁndings heavily challenge the oncogenic shock concept by
arguing strongly that absolute potency is not sufﬁcient to

3368

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

mediate efﬁcacy and that residual intracellular TKI above a
critical threshold level is required. Furthermore, exploiting
the basis of the extremely slow dissociation properties of
TKIs like ponatinib may aid in maximizing efﬁcacy of a small
molecule even at lower doses. Although extensive studies
have been conducted conﬁrming the therapeutic and prognostic value of monitoring drug levels in plasma of patients
with CML (9, 44, 45), this approach does not provide direct
information about the intracellular stores of drug, which
seems to be of critical importance particularly in the case of
TKIs featuring short plasma half-lives such as dasatinib.
Consideration and monitoring of intracellular drug retention properties will yield improved candidate compounds for
clinical development and complementary data for interpreting and deﬁning rationale behind optimal dosing regimens
for molecularly targeted therapies in CML and other
malignancies.
