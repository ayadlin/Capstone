ABSTRACT
Secretagogin (SCGN) has recently been identified to play a crucial role in cell
apoptosis, receptor signaling and differentiation. However, its clinical significance and
functional roles in SCLC chemoresistance remain unknown. Here we examined the
expression of SCGN in clinical samples from SCLC patients and evaluated its relation
with clinical prognosis. Then up and down-regulation of SCGN were carried out in
SCLC cell lines to assess its influence on chemoresistance. Furthermore, luciferase
reporter assay was used to evaluate whether SCGN is a novel direct target of miR-494.
Our results revealed that elevated expression of SCGN was correlated with the poorer
prognosis of SCLC patients and the more significant correlation with chemosensitivity.
We also found that knockdown of SCGN expression in H69AR and H446AR cells
increased chemosensitivity via increasing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of G0/
G1 phase, while over-expression of SCGN reduced chemosensitivity in sensitive H69
and H446 cells. SCGN as a novel target of miR-494 by luciferase reporter assay, upregulation of miR-494 can sensitize H69AR cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. These
results suggest SCGN is involved in the chemoresistance of SCLC under the regulation
of miR-494 and may be a potential biomarker for predicting therapeutic response in
treatment SCLC.

EF-hand calcium-binding protein with similarities to
calmodulin and calbindin-D28K [5], it expresses mainly in
normal endocrine tissues, including distinct brain regions
as well as neuroendocrine cells of gastrointestinal tract and
pancreas [6]. SCGN has also been reported to expresses
highly in various neuroendocrine-derived tumors, such
as neuroendocrine carcinoids and carcinoid metastases,
lung neuroendocrine tumors, pancreas, prostate cancer,
adrenal gland, pituitary adenomas and colon carcinomas
[5-11]. Although recent studies have shown that SCGN is
involved in cell cycle regulation, developmental processes,
apoptosis, transcription and secretion control [12,13], the
role of SCGN in SCLC chemoresistance has not been
elucidated yet.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs of 18–24 nucleotides which are responsible
for the post-transcriptional regulation of their target
mRNAs [14]. The level of individual miRNA changes
dramatically in different cell types and developmental
stages, it participated in cell growth, differentiation and
apoptosis [15-17]. The differential expression profiles
of miRNAs from tumor and paratumor tissues show its
important roles in tumor classification and prediction
of therapy response [18,19]. Some studies have also
explored that miRNAs are closely associated with the

chemosensitivity or chemoresistance, such as miR21, miR-195, miR-455-3p and miR-10a [20,21], they
all contribute to the development of glioblastoma
chemoresistance. In addition, miR-128-2, miR-200b and
miR-494 were reported to be closely associated with lung
cancer chemoresistance [22-25]. Our team found that miR494 expresses much lower in H69AR cells than H69 cells
by microarray and qRT-PCR [26]. However, there is still
no report available about miR-494 functions in SCLC drug
resistance until now.
To better understand the biological function of
SCGN in SCLC, we detected the expression of SCGN
in SCLC tissues and blood samples and evaluated the
relevance of SCGN expression with clinical prognosis of
SCLC patients. We then further investigated its potential
role on chemoresistance by the cellular model of human
SCLC resistant cell lines (H69AR and H446AR). In
addition, luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm
SCGN as a novel target of miR-494. Therefore, we
conclude that SCGN may play a role in SCLC progression
and chemoresistance under the regulation of miR-494.

RESULTS

SCGN expression was localized in the cytoplasm of
cancer cells (Fig.1B). No positive staining for SCGN was
presented in the normal lung alveolar epithelium (Fig.1A).
The positive rate of SCGN expression was 81.82% (63/77)
in SCLC. Table 1 summarizes the relationship between
SCGN expression and clinic pathological characteristics
in SCLC patients. By Fisher’s exact test, no significant
difference was observed with respect to gender and age.
Lower expression of SCGN was shown in limited diseaseSCLC (LD-SCLC) than that in extensive disease-SCLC
(ED-SCLC) (P=0.000). By univariate analysis, disease
stage (P=0.000) and SCGN expression (P=0.000) were
significantly associated with survival except gender and
age. For overall survival, SCGN level was revealed to be
closely correlates with significant overall survival of 77
SCLC patients via the Kaplan–Meier method (P=0.000,
Fig.1C). Multivariate analysis were performed about
SCGN expression (P=0.000) and disease stage (P=0.000)
in SCLC patients (Table.1). SCGN expression was an

To investigate the clinicopathological features
of SCGN expression in SCLC, immunohistochemistry
staining was performed on 77 samples from SCLC
patients. The slides were reviewed independently by 2
pathologists in a blinded manner according to the intensity
of staining. Positively stained SCGN was mainly located
in the cytoplasm of SCLC cells and appeared as light
brown and brown particles. A sample was considered
positive if more than 50% of the tumor cells retained
nuclear staining, and 5 fields were randomly selected
according to semiquantitative scales (high, 3; medium, 2;
low, 1; no staining, 0), and only tumor cells were scored.

H69AR and H446AR cells. SCGN-395 and SCGN-773
were selected for the followed study for their significant
inhibition of SCGN expression both at mRNA and protein
level (Fig.2C-2F, P=0.000). As expected, knockdown of
SCGN resulted in the formation of sensitive phenotype.
The cell survival and the IC50 values of SCGN-siRNAs
transfected cells significantly decreased with treatment of
chemotherapeutic drugs including ADM, DDP or VP-16
(Fig.3). In contrast, up-regulation of SCGN in H69 and
H446 cells (Fig.4A-D) resulted in a significant increase of
cell IC50 values, survival and the resistance to ADM, DDP
or VP-16 (Fig.4E-H).

SCGN expression is associated with SCLC
chemoresistance
To investigate the effect of SCGN on SCLC
chemoresistance, the differential expression of SCGN
was detected in SCLC drug-resistant cells (H69AR and
H446AR) and drug-sensitive cells (H69 and H446) by
qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that
SCGN expression increased more significantly in H69AR
and H446AR cells than that in H69 and H446 cells both
at mRNA and protein level (Fig.2A&2B). To further
investigate the effects of SCGN on chemoresistance of
SCLC, we designed three siRNAs (SCGN-289, -395,
-773) against SCGN to inhibit SCGN expression in

SCGN resulted in increased cell apoptosis (Fig.5A&5C)
and G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest (Fig.5B&5D) by flow
cytometry analysis. Furthermore, knockdown of SCGN
decreased anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in mRNA and
protein levels (Fig.6G&6H). On the other hand, enforced
SCGN expression decreased cell apoptosis (Fig.6A&C)
and the cell cycle arrest in G2/M (41.24%±6.56% vs.
8.86%±0.56%, P=0.000, Fig.6B&6D) by flow cytometry
analysis. Meanwhile, over-expression of SCGN increased
anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 both at mRNA and protein levels

(Fig.6E&6F).

SCGN is a direct target of miR-494
By searching PicTar, TarScan and miRBase
database, we found that 3’-UTR of human SCGN contains
putative regions that match to the seed sequence of several
miRNAs, including miR-494, which suggests a possible
modulation of SCGN by miR-494 (Fig.7A). According
to our previous studies, 6.93-fold decrease of miR-494

expression was revealed in H69AR cells by miRNA
microarray. An 8.87-fold change of miR-494 in H69AR
cells was further confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.7B).
To verify whether SCGN is a direct target of miR494, we constructed luciferase reporters with wide-type
(psiCHECK2-SCGN-mut-3’UTR) and mutated 3’-UTR
(psiCHECK2-SCGN -3’ UTR) of SCGN. Both the wildtype and the mutant-type reporters were introduced into

H69AR cells and co-transfected with miR-494 mimics or
inhibitors. The Luciferase activity of SCGN was measured
by the dual luciferase assays. As shown in Figure 7C,
luciferase activity showed a significant decrease or
increase as compared with either mutant or empty vector
controls co-transfected with miR-494 mimics or inhibitors.
We further examined whether miR-494 can affect
the endogenous expression of SCGN by up or down-

regulation of miR-494 using miR-494 mimics or inhibitors
respectively. SCGN expression at mRNA and protein
levels decreased with transfection of miR-494 mimics in
H69AR cells (Fig.7D&7E). Meanwhile, SCGN expression
significantly increased in H69 cells transfected with miR494 inhibitors (Fig.7F&7G). These findings suggest that
miR-494 can directly target the 3`UTR of SCGN.

transfected with miR-494 inhibitors in H69 cells can lead
to decreasing sensitivity to ADM, DDP or VP-16 (Fig.8B).
Furthermore, we performed gain-of-function and
loss-of-function studies to elucidate whether the effects
of SCGN on chemoresistance were mediated by miR494 in SCLC cells. Firstly, H69AR cells were transfected
with SCGN-773 or miR-494 mimics. As shown in Figure
8C and 8D, knockdown of SCGN led to significantly
increasing of chemosensitivity, which is similar to
those induced by miR-494 mimics (Fig.8E, P<0.05).
Subsequently, we evaluated whether ectopic expression
of SCGN could rescue the suppressive effect of miR-494.
H69AR cells were transfected with miR-494 mimics for
24 hours and followed by transfected with EGFP-SCGN,
which encoded the full-length coding sequence without the
3’UTR region. The results showed that ectopic significant
expression of SCGN can rescue drug resistance repression
induced by miR-494 (Fig.8E, P <0.05).

Modulation of SCLC chemoresistance by SCGN
is partly mediated under miR-494
The results presented above indicated that miR494 can regulate SCGN expression in SCLC cells. We
then investigated whether miR-494 was also involved in
SCLC chemoresistance. H69AR cells transfected with
miR-494 mimics demonstrated an increasing sensitivity
to ADM, DDP or VP-16 as compared with non-specific
miRNAs (Fig.8A). In contrast, knockdown of miR-494 by

MiR-494 expression level shows a negative
correlation with SCGN in SCLC FFPE tissues

Circulating SCGN is negatively correlated
with miR-494 as a predictive marker of
chemosensitivity in SCLC patients

We have showed SCGN was overexpressed in
SCLC FFPE tissues and miR-494 can modulate SCGN
expression in SCLC cells. The next question is whether
there is any relationship between SCGN expression and
miR-494. To address this issue, we extracted total RNA
from the samples and analyzed miR-494 expression
using qRT-PCR. Consistent with the data obtained from
SCLC cell lines, higher expression level of miR-494 was
showed in SCGN -negative specimens than in SCGNpositive SCLC tissues The results suggest that miR-494
was negatively correlated with SCGN expression (Fig.7H
and 7I).

To evaluate the significance of the circulating SCGN
level in chemosensitivity, 42 blood samples from the 77
patients mentioned above were collected from SCLC
patient before and after chemotherapy. The expression of
SCGN and miR-494 in blood samples were detected by
qRT-PCR. The results show that SCGN is significantly
lower in 18 sensitive cases to chemotherapy than that in
24 resistant cases (Fig.9A, P=0.001), while miR-494 is
significantly higher in sensitive cases than refractory cases
(Fig.9B, P=0.000). Figure 9C shows an inverse correlation
(2-tailed Pearson correlation, r=-0.562, P=0.000) between
SCGN and miR-494 expression at mRNA level in scatter

to chemotherapy in SCLC (Supplementary Table S1). The
results suggest that SCGN might be a predictive marker
for chemosensitivity in SCLC.

the value of our work, in contrast to the similar studies
with respective independent samples source. Most
interestingly, recent study shown that SCGN may be
one of genes involved in tumorgenesis and progression
in Central Neurocytomas (CNs) [27]. In clear-cell renal
cell carcinomas, expression of SCGN is associated with
a high metastasis rate [13]. So far, the role of SCGN in
SCLC have not been previously clarified. Therefore, our
research may provide independent predictive indicator for
SCLC patients.
Although SCGN gene is shown to be involved in
various cellular processes including cell differentiation
and proliferation [5,6], little is known regarding the
role of SCGN genes in apoptosis and chemoresistance
of SCLC. According to our data above, we have
successfully established a H69AR-si-SCGN cell line
with SCGN knockdown and a H69AR cell line with
SCGN coordinated up-regulation. By CCK-8 assays, we
found that knockdown of SCGN significantly enhanced

DISCUSSION
In this study, we reported the expression of
SCGN and miR-494 in SCLC and its association with
chemoresistance and clinical prognosis. We firstly
analyzed the expression of SCGN in human SCLC tissues
and blood samples and found that SCGN expression level
significantly correlated with clinical stage and overall
survival of the SCLC patients. Our data indicate that the
expression levels of miR-494 and SCGN independently
predict sensitivity of SCLC chemoresistance and disease
outcome. Of note, the 42 blood samples are derived from
the same patients of the FFPE samples, this increases

chemosensitivity in H69AR-si-SCGN cells as compared
to the H69AR cells. In contrast, over-expression of SCGN
via stable transfect resulted in resistant phenotype of H69
cells. Therefore, our findings suggest SCGN may play an
important role in chemoresistance of SCLC.
Based on the high level of SCGN expression in
SCLC multidrug-resistant cells, we further evaluate
the clinical significance of SCGN level in blood
samples from clinical patients. According to the results,
SCGN level in chemosensitive patients after given
chemotherapeutic treatment is significantly lower
than that before given chemotherapeutic treatment.
Meanwhile, SCGN in refractory patients is slightly
lower after given chemotherapeutic treatment than that
before given chemotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore,
compared with refractory patients, the decrease of SCGN
circulating levels in chemosensitive patients was much
more obvious, and the difference between these two
groups shows significant. These findings suggest that the
blood SCGN level could be a predictive marker of SCLC
chemoresistance.
Bcl-2 family proteins have been clarified to
participate tumorgenesis and chemoresistance in
many tumors by researchers[33,37-40]. Based on the
consideration above, we analyzed the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the effect of SCGN on cell
apoptosis as well as cell cycle. Our results show that one
reason of the resistant phenotype in H69AR cells may
be that SCGN decreased drug-induced apoptosis and
increased G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest via Bcl-2-regulated
apoptosis pathway. Therefore, combined with the clinicpathological information of patients, Bcl-2 may be another
predictive marker of SCLC chemoresistance.
MiRNAs represent a novel class of genes that
function as negative regulators of gene expression.
Recently, miRNAs have been implicated in several cancer
cells proliferation and chemoresistance [28,29]. However,
aberrant miRNA expression and its chemoresistance in
human SCLC have not been well documented. Here, we
showed that miR-494 was down expression in H69AR
cells. Using three prediction algorithms in the miRNAs
database, miR-494 was predicted to have a potential
interactive site at the 3’UTR of SCGN mRNA. Forced
expression of miR-494 inhibited SCGN expression
in resistance H69AR cells and rendered it resistant to
chemotherapy, whereas knockdown of miR-494 elevated
SCGN expression and overrode drug sensitive in H69
cells. Dual luciferase assays to verify SCGN as a direct
target of miR-494. We also found that SCGN was widely
over-expressed and inversely correlated with miR-494 in
the blood samples and tissues from the SCLC patients.
MiR-494 has recently been reported to suppress cell
proliferation in lung cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and
gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells [30-33]. Some genes
such as IGF2BP1, CDK6, PTTG1, PTEN, p190B, and
SMAD3 were identified direct targets of miR-494[30www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

36]. In our study, we firstly clarify the role of miR-494
in human SCLC chemoresistance by direct targeting of
SCGN. The results indicate that high levels of miR-494/
SCGN expression are associated with chemoresistance
and predict SCLC patients’ clinical outcome with the
clinicopathological data. According to our data, we
conclude that miR-494/SCGN may be involved in
chemoresistance of SCLC through Bcl-2 pathway.
In conclusion, our study showed that SCGN level
is closely associated with clinical stage, chemoresistance
and overall survival in patients with SCLC. These findings
suggest SCGN may serve as a biomarker predictive for
chemoresistance and prognostic for survival of SCLC
patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SCGNmediated chemoresistance may be through Bcl-2 pathway
and was regulated by miR-494. This study provides a
novel mechanism of chemoresistance mediated by SCGN,
suggesting that it may be a candidate target for developing
therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
A total of 77 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissues and 42 blood samples out of the 77 cases
were obtained from different patients who had received
chemotherapy or bronchofiberscopy (BF) or biopsy for
SCLC between the period 2008.01 and 2011.08, they
all received care and follow-up in Southern Medical
University affiliated Zhujiang Hospital (Guangzhou).
The research protocols were approved by the Ethics
Committee of Zhujiang Hospital. Samples were divided
into ‘‘sensitive’’ (complete response or partial response)
and ‘‘insensitive’’ (stable disease or progressive disease)
groups according to the patient’s responses assessed
using medical image analysis and detection of serum
tumor markers after 4 or 5 cycles of etoposide-based
chemotherapy.

Cell culture
Human SCLC cell line NCI-H69, NCI-H446 and the
drug-resistant subline NCI-H69AR were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) and
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium contain in L-Glutamine
with 10% and 20% fetal calf serum respectively in an
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. The adriamycin-resistant
NCI-H446 cell line (NCI-H446AR) was obtained by
culturing these cells in gradually increasing doses of
adriamycin up to 0.8 uM after a total of 14 months in
our laboratory. The drug-resistant cells were maintained
in drug-free medium for at least 2 weeks before any
experiment.

After 8 months, cells which grew in 0.4 uM ADM were
obtained. After a further 6 months, cells which grew
in 0.8 uM ADM were obtained. This cell line has been
designated H446AR and has been maintained by alternate
feedings with drug-free medium or medium containing
0.8 uM ADM. The stability of the resistant phenotype
was determined by culturing continuously in medium
with either 0.8 uM ADM or no drug and assessing relative
resistance after various periods of time up to 5months.
The process is established by referring establishment of
H69AR (CANCER RESEARCH 47, 2594-2598, May 15,
1987).

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 5×103 cells per
well. After transient transfection or adherence of stable
transfected cells, cells were treated with drugs for 24h.
A total of three chemotherapy drugs [Cisplatin (DDP;
Shandong, China), Etoposide (VP-16; Jiangshu, China),
Adriamycin (ADM; Jiangshu, China)] were used. The
absorbance at 450nm was measured after incubation with
10 µl of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo, Kumamato, Japan) for
4h. The cells incubated without drugs were set at 100%
survival and were used to calculate the concentration
of each chemotherapeutic drug IC50. The assay was
conducted in five replicate wells for each sample and three
parallel experiments were performed.

Cell transfection
Cells were transiently transfected with 100nmol/L of
miR-494 mimics, inhibitors and miRNA negative control
(miR-NC) (Bioneer, Korea), or 60nmol/L small interfering
RNA (siRNA) specific to SCGN, scrambled siRNA
negative control (NC) (Genepharma, Shanghai, China) by
using Lipofectamine 2000 and OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen).
For stable transfection, SCGN expression plasmid
(SCGN-eGFP-N1-1) and eGFP-N1 empty plasmid were
transfected into NCI-H69 and NCI-H446 cells by using
Lipofectamine 2000. Positive transfectants were selected
in 500 ug/ml G418 (Calbiochem).

RNA isolation and
transcription-PCR

quantitative

Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were treated with drugs for 24h after
transfection, and then collected for apoptosis and cellcycle assay. Cell apoptosis assay was performed by using
AnnexinV/propidium iodide detection kit (Keygene,
Nanjing, China). For cell-cycle assay, the cells were
collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C for 16h and then
stained with propidium iodide.

reverse

Total RNA, including miRNAs, was isolated
from cell lines, blood and FFPE tissues using TRIzol
(Invitrogen), miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) and miRNeasy FFPE
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA synthesis was carried out according to PrimeScript
RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The miRNA
sequence-specific reverse transcription qRT-PCR for miR494 and endogenous control U6 were performed according
to Hairpin-itTM miRNAs qRT-PCR quantization kit and U6
snRNA real-time PCR normalization kit (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China). GAPDH or U6 snRNA was used as an
endogenous control.

Luciferase reporter assay
Cells were seeded in a 48-well plate and
cotransfected with 200 ng of either pcDNA/miR-494 or
pcDNA/miR-NC vectors, and 10 ng of pLUC vectors
containing firefly luciferase reporter gene, as well as
the 3’-UTR of SCGN gene. Cells were harvested for
luciferase activity assays 48 hours after transfection. A
luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used
according the manufacturer’s protocol.

Immunohistochemistry staining

Western blot analysis

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of
SCLC clinical patients samples were sectioned at 4
mm thickness and analyzed for SCGN (1:100, Sigma)
expression. Visualization was achieved using the EnVision
peroxidase system (Dako). A sample was considered
positive if more than 50% of the tumor cells retained

Protein lysates were separated by 12% SDSPAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF
(polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). Then,
the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human
SCGN monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruze, USA) and

nuclear staining, and 5 fields were randomly selected
according to semiquantitative scales. The intensity of
staining was scored manually (high, 3; medium, 2; low, 1;
no staining, 0) by 2 independent experienced pathologists,
and only tumor cells were scored. Negative controls were
performed by replacing the primary antibodies stated
above with PBS. Positively stained SCGN was mainly
located in the cytoplasm of SCLC cells and appeared as
light brown and brown particles.

carried out with SPSS 13.0 software. Possible differences
between groups were analyzed using Student’s t test
or one-way ANOVA. The association between SCGN
expression and clinical features were analyzed by Fisher’s
exact test. Survival curves were obtained by KaplainMeier method. Prognostic factors were examined by
univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional
hazards model). P<0.05 was considered significant.
