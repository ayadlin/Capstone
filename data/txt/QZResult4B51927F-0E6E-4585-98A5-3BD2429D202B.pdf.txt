Abstract
Chronic exposures to cadmium compounds are carcinogenic.
It was hypothesized that the development of resistance to
cadmium may drive carcinogenesis. This is achieved by
selection of resistant cells in which the apoptotic response is
significantly attenuated. The induction of cadmium resistance
in rat lung epithelial cells (LEC) was used to explore the
mechanisms of cadmium-induced adaptation and carcinogenesis. Our previous results showed that LECs developed
resistance to apoptosis during cadmium adaptation possibly
due to perturbation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway.
Here, we further study these cells by comparative proteomics.
Interestingly, we showed that two intermediate filament
proteins, cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and cytokeratin 14 (CK14), were
increased significantly and stably maintained only in the
adapted cells but not in cadmium-treated parental cells. It has
been documented that CK8/cytokeratin 18 provided resistance
to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–induced apoptosis and CK14
may function as an inhibitor of TNF-TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)
signaling through an association with TNFR1-associated death
domain protein, suggesting that up-regulation of CK8 and
CK14 may be responsible for apoptotic resistance. Finally, we
showed that small interfering RNA–specific knockdown of CK8
in cadmium-adapted cells attenuated the cadmium resistance,
indicating the potential role of CK8 in cadmium resistance.
This acquired self-resistance to apoptosis could account for
cadmium-induced carcinogenesis, as this promotes neoplastic
cell survival as well as subsequent clonal expansion and then
progression of tumor development. Thus, increased expression of these cytokeratins represents an adaptive survival
mechanism that resists cadmium-induced apoptosis and it is
unprecedented that cells respond to long-term cadmium
exposure by modulating keratin dynamics. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Chronic exposures to cadmium derivatives are nearly unavoidable in daily life, such as from food, soil, water, and airborne
particles. Although it has been well documented that cadmium
exposure can cause a wide variety of adverse health effects
and cancer development, the mechanism of its action has not been
well established (1–4). It has been suggested that cadmium exerts
genotoxic or carcinogenic effects through an alteration in
expression of immediate early genes (c-jun, c-fos, and c-myc) or

the tumor suppressor gene p53 (5–8). However, among all its
effects, depressed apoptosis observed during cadmium adaptation
is one of the important mechanisms driving cadmium carcinogenesis; this is achieved by selection of adapted cells in which
apoptotic response is significantly attenuated (9, 10).
We previously reported that cadmium-adapted alveolar epithelial cells are protected from oxidant-induced apoptosis and along
with the induction of stress gene expression (metallothionein,
glutathione S-transferase, and g-glutamylcysteine synthetase;
ref. 11). In addition, a more recent finding from our group
showed that these adapted cells develop tolerance to cell death
generally due to perturbation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) signaling pathway and the nonresponsiveness of JNK
phosphorylation is critical for the cadmium tolerance in these
cells (9). However, the mechanism(s) of how JNK inactivation is still
unknown or whether the presence of other yet unknown important
regulatory mechanisms governs the death tolerance. To gain
further insights into the mechanism for cellular long-term survival
in response to cadmium, here, we did comparative proteome
analysis of these cells with parental cells that were either untreated
or treated with cadmium. Protein spots altered in cadmiumadapted cells were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database searching. Remarkably, cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and cytokeratin 14 (CK14) were increased
only in the adapted cells but not in parental cells treated with
cadmium, suggesting that these proteins were secondary cadmiumresponsive proteins.
Cytokeratin proteins constitute the largest and most complex
class of intermediate filaments. They are expressed in epithelial
cells throughout the body where they form structural networks to
span the cell cytoplasm linking the plasma membrane, nucleus, and
other cytoskeletal components. Keratin filaments are obligate
heteropolymers consisting of type I and II proteins in a 1:1 ratio.
The 12 type I and the 8 type II keratin monomers pair in certain
defined combinations in a tissue-specific and developmentally
regulated manner (12). The expression of certain keratin proteins
in a cell at a given time is defined as its state of differentiation, and
modulation of differentiation program has been well documented
in cell transformation and cancer development (12). Recently,
cytokeratin 19 has been found to be a unique biomarker to judge
the invasiveness of breast cancer cells (13). Although modulation
of differentiation program has been known for many years and
used to distinguish various cell types or as biomarkers in cancer
progression, very few studies have addressed the underlining
importance of this transition. In this study, we provided evidence
to show that increased expression of cytokeratins in cadmiumadapted cells represents an additional survival mechanism that
resists cadmium-induced apoptosis and it is unprecedented in our
study that cells respond to long-term cadmium exposure by
modulating keratin dynamics.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) was purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). PlusOne 2-D Clean-Up kit and Silver Staining kit were
purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). All other
general chemicals were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Sigma.
Antibodies used for Western blot were purchased from Sigma, Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA).
Cell culture and transfection. A rat lung epithelial cell line (LEC) was
isolated and characterized by Li et al. (14). This cell line is designated as
CdS in this study for its cadmium sensitivity in comparison with cadmiumresistant (CdR) cell lines developed in our laboratory. Development of
CdR cells has been previously described by Lau et al. (9). In all experiments,
cells were subjected to treatment at f75% confluence. Cell viability was
measured by naphthol blue black (NBB) staining assay as described
previously (15).
LEC cells were cultured in six-well plates before transfection with
100 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes against CK8 using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At 48 h after transfection,
the cells were harvested for two-dimensional PAGE analysis or Western blot
analysis after cadmium treatment. The sequence of the region targeted by
CK8 siRNA (Qiagen, Lafayette, CO) 5¶-CAGCAUCAUUGCUGAGGUCAA-3¶
was nucleotides 771 to 791 of the CK8 open reading frame. Control cells
were incubated with the transfection reagent for as long as the transfected
cells. Control experiments were carried out with the nonspecific siRNA
control IX containing 47% GC (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) under
the conditions of CK8 siRNA or with LipofectAMINE 2000 alone. As there
were no differences in the CK8 level between the control siRNA and
LipofectAMINE 2000 alone, we commonly used the transfection agent alone
for control experiments.
Cell lysate preparation and conditions of Western blot and twodimensional PAGE. After treatment, cells were then washed thrice with
ice-cold PBS, scraped into centrifuge tube, and then harvested by
centrifugation at 1,000  g for 5 min at 4jC.
For Western blot analysis, cell pellets were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer according to the protocol described by Upstate
Biotechnology. Equal amounts of proteins (40 Ag) were fractionated on a
SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with various primary
antibodies. After incubation with secondary antibodies, immunoblots were
visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham
Biosciences).
For two-dimensional PAGE analysis, cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer
[8 mol/L urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS], incubated on ice for 30 min, and
centrifuged at 16,000  g for 5 min at 4jC. The supernatant was saved and
then further purified by using the PlusOne 2-D Clean-Up kit in accordance
with the manufacturer. The purified samples were finally redissolved in
rehydration buffer (8 mol/L urea, 2% CHAPS), aliquoted into several tubes,
and stored at 80jC after protein quantitation. Two-dimensional PAGE
was done on 80 Ag of cleaned-up cell extract with Amersham Biosciences
IPGphor IEF and Hoefer SE 600 electrophoresis units. All gels were
visualized by silver staining using the PlusOne Silver Staining kit in
accordance with the manufacturer.
Image analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, and protein identification.
The stained gels were scanned using an ImageScanner (Amersham
Biosciences) operated by the LabScan 3.00 software. Image analysis was
carried out by using the ImageMaster 2D Elite software 4.01. Only upregulated/down-regulated spots (more than F2-fold) or spots that either
appeared/disappeared were selected for analysis with MS. Protein spots
were excised and transferred into siliconized 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Gel
chips were destained, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and then rehydrated in
trypsin solution (10 Ag/mL in 25 mmol/L NH4HCO3) at 37jC overnight.
The digest was then applied onto a sample plate and coated with matrix
(a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid). Tryptic peptide MS were obtained using
a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

and CdR( 2) were treated with 20 Amol/L (A ), 50 to 200 Amol/L (B), and
50 Amol/L (C ) of CdCl2 for the indicated times; cells were lysed; and protein
extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibody against MKP-1.
The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti–h-actin
antibody to monitor the loading difference. Data are representative of three
independent experiments.

Protein identification was done by searching in NCBInr protein database
using MS-Fit.1 The criteria for searching were set with 25 ppm or better
mass accuracy, at least four matching peptide masses, and molecular
weight and isoelectric point (pI) matching estimated values from gels.
Species search was limited to Rattus norvegicus.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done by using two-tailed
Student’s t test, and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed
as the mean F SD of triplicate samples, and the reproducibility was
confirmed in three separate experiments.

Results
Cadmium induces mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression in cadmium-sensitive and cadmiumadapted cells. From our previous studies, we established
cadmium-adapted LECs that exhibit resistance to cadmiuminduced apoptosis (9, 11). In conjunction with primary response/
defense proteins, we have shown that cadmium resistance in LECs
is generally due to the perturbation of the JNK pathway (9). First,

Role of CK8 in Cadmium-Induced Carcinogenesis

we suspected that desensitization of JNK in cadmium-adapted cells
was due to the up-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) phosphatases (MKP), which dephosphorylates activated
JNK, because the MKPs are responsible for inactivation of MAPKs
in various cell types (16, 17). Among the MKPs, MKP-1 is the best
characterized member of this family and has been shown to
inactivate JNK. Various stresses that activate JNK can induce MKP
(18, 19). Thus, the duration of JNK activation can be regulated by
MKP through a feedback mechanism.
Elevated levels of MKP-1 have been shown in renal cell
carcinoma cell lines in which they developed apoptotic resistance
to subsequent drug treatment (20). To determine whether
cadmium exposure would affect the MKP-1, we used antibody
against MKP-1 to examine the effect of cadmium on CdS, CdR , and
CdR cultured in the absence of cadmium for two passages
[CdR( 2)] by Western blot throughout a 24-h time interval.
Surprisingly, cadmium-adapted cells behaved similarly like cadmium-sensitive cells, which have undetectable basal levels of
MKP-1. However, on 20 Amol/L CdCl2 treatment, MKP-1 was
rapidly induced only in CdS as indicated by the increase in MKP-1
expression (Fig. 1A). In contrast to CdS, the MKP-1 level on CdR and
CdR( 2) was weakly stimulated or almost unchanged after
exposure to 20 Amol/L CdCl2. This is out of our speculations
because CdR cells should at least have higher basal levels of MKP-1
to desensitize JNK. To see how cadmium-adapted cells respond to
higher cadmium dosages on MKP-1 induction, cells were treated
with higher concentrations of cadmium (50, 100, or 200 Amol/L) for
2 h and the levels of MKP-1 were determined (Fig. 1B). We chose a
2-h treatment because, at this time point, cadmium induced MKP-1
and activated MAPKs in preliminary experiments. Interestingly, the
level of MKP-1 was markedly decreased in all the CdR cells

compared with cadmium-sensitive cells at each level of cadmium
treatment (at least in 50 and 100 Amol/L). Because CdR has higher
basal level of metallothionein-1 mRNA than CdR( 2), which
resulted in more efficient metal-binding capacity (9), the level of
MKP-1 was also markedly decreased in CdR even exposed up to
200 Amol/L CdCl2 compared with CdR( 2). Treatment of cells with
50 Amol/L CdCl2 for 0.5-, 1-, and 2-h time intervals also showed
similar results (Fig. 1C). Thus, JNK pathway desensitization in CdR
was not due to the up-regulation of MKP-1 expression, as there was
indeed less amount of MKP-1 induced in CdR cells. These results
were indicative of nonessential role of MKP-1 in cadmium
adaptation in both CdR and CdR( ). Therefore, this prompted us
to further study the resistant factors by proteomic approaches.
Proteome profiles between cadmium-sensitive and cadmiumadapted cells. To search for proteins associated with cadmium
adaptation, proteome profile of parental cells was compared with
that of cadmium-adapted cells by using two-dimensional PAGE.
Figure 2A depicted the silver-stained two-dimensional gel protein
expression profile obtained after separation of protein lysates from
these cells. Spot volume comparison was made between the
samples with the ImageMaster program. In general, there were no
significant differences between CdS and CdR , except for two spots.
These two spots did not change in cadmium-treated parental cells,
indicating their potential roles as other cadmium-responsive
proteins that confer resistance to cadmium-induced apoptosis.
Figure 2B was a comparative montage view of the regions shown
in Fig. 2A, where significant differences in protein expression level
were marked. These protein spots were excised and subjected to
trypsin digestion, MALDI-TOF-MS measurements, and database
searching with MS-Fit. These two proteins were identified as CK8
and CK14 (Tables 1 and 2).

comparison. Data are representative

CK8 and CK14 overexpressions in cadmium-adapted cells
result from long-term cadmium adaptation. In the proteome
data, the levels of CK8 and CK14 were increased only in adapted
cells but not in cadmium-treated parental cells, suggesting that
their up-regulation may be the secondary consequence of cellular
response to cadmium. CK8 and CK14 are structural proteins
belonging to the intermediate filaments. In many cancer cells,
including human breast carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma,
and gastric adenocarcinoma (21–23), CK8 and CK14 are highly
elevated. In addition, CK8 and CK14 have been shown to suppress
apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, and the death inhibitory
action of CK8 has been attributed to its ability to provide resistance
to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis (24). Similarly,
CK14 may function as an inhibitor of TNF-TNF receptor (TNFR) 1
signaling through an association with TNFR1-associated death
domain protein (TRADD; ref. 25). Thus, we predicted that elevated
CK8 and CK14 in the cadmium-adapted LECs is a part of the
cellular responses to resist cadmium-induced apoptosis.
In parallel, we also did proteome analysis on cadmium-adapted
cells after removal of cadmium in medium for various number
of passages [i.e., CdR( 2) and CdR( 7); Fig. 2B]. The elevated
cytokeratin expressions were stably maintained even after
culturing the adapted cells in the absence of cadmium for at
least seven passages (28 days; Table 1). Thus, the increased CK8

and CK14 expressions were consequences of long-term adaptation
to cadmium but not inducible by short-term treatment. Because
the data of CK14 in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are a partial sequence from subtractive cloning,
therefore, in this study, we first only focused our attention on CK8
to address its importance in cadmium adaptation and acquired
tolerance.
The effects of CK8 gene silencing on cadmium sensitivity.
From our proteomic studies, we suggest that if increased CK8
was involved in enhanced cadmium resistance, then removal of
CK8 expression should block this protection. For this reason,
we resolved to use loss-of-function method to silence the highly
expressed CK8 in CdR by siRNA technique. To test the effect of
silencing of the CK8 gene on cadmium sensitivity, cadmiumadapted cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNA and grown
for 2 days. The samples were processed for two-dimensional gel to
determine the expression of CK8. As expected, transfection of
cadmium-adapted cells with siRNA resulted in f60% reduction in
CK8 gene expression (Fig. 3A). More importantly, the silencing
of CK8 before the addition of cadmium reactivated JNK and
significantly decreased the cell viability of cadmium-adapted cells
compared with control cells (Fig. 3B and C). These results clearly
showed that silencing of CK8 recurred cadmium-sensitive phenotype in the cadmium-adapted cells. To sum up, based on the results

obtained from silencing of CK8 in cadmium-adapted cells by siRNA,
we concluded that the elevated expression of CK8 in CdR LEC cells is
crucial in protection against cadmium-induced apoptosis.

the up-regulation was due to the secondary consequence of
cellular response to cadmium. Their up-regulation was not due to
the presence of cadmium in the medium, as this also occurred
in cadmium-adapted cells that were cultured in the absence of
cadmium for as long as seven passages. These results were indicative
of cytokeratin overexpressions in both CdR and CdR( ) once
resistance to apoptosis develops. More importantly, we showed
that siRNA-specific knockdown of CK8 in cadmium-adapted cells
reactivated JNK and attenuated the cadmium resistance, indicating
the potential role of CK8 in cadmium resistance.
CK8 and CK18 formed the major structural keratins in
noncutaneous epithelial cells in liver, bowel, and single-layered
epithelia. A recent study provided evidence for the key role of CK8/
cytokeratin 18 (CK18) in moderating the signaling of TNF (24). It
was shown that decreasing levels of CK8 and CK18 in cultured
epithelial cells increased cellular sensitivity to killing by TNF due to
the loss of binding of both CK8 and CK18 with the cytoplasmic
domain of TNFR2. In addition, CK8 and CK18 diminished the TNFdependent activation of JNK and the nuclear factor-nB transcription factor. In vivo, CK8- or CK18-null mice were shown to be more
sensitive to TNF-mediated apoptotic liver damage (24). In a twohybrid screen, TRADD specifically bound CK18 and CK14, type I
keratins, but did not bind type II keratins, including cytokeratin
5 and CK8, or type III intermediate filaments, including vimentin,
glial fibrillary acidic protein, and desmin. Because CK14 is
preferentially expressed in the basal layer of epidermis, and in
the same fashion as CK18, it is possible that epidermal CK14 may
function as an inhibitor of TNF-TNFR1 signaling through an
association with TRADD (25). In this study, although we have not
further studied the function of CK14, from the literature and our
results presented here, we speculate that it is also a potential
cadmium-responsive protein that warrants future studies.
It has been shown that the phosphorylation of human CK8 at
Ser73 could involve a kinase from the MAPK family due to the
serine-proline motif of CK8-Ser73 phosphoacceptor site (26). By
comparing the sequence surrounding the Ser 63 and Ser73
phosphoacceptor sites in c-Jun with that surrounding position 73
in rat CK8, there is no such serine residue on this position. Hence,
rat CK8 is not subjected to phosphorylation at Ser73. However,
similar consensus sequence was found at its Ser432 position
(tail domain; i.e., L-T-S432-P-G). Phosphorylation at Ser23 and Ser431
on human CK8 implicated that both the head and tail domains of
CK8 can be phosphorylated as shown previously for cytokeratin 1,
another type II keratin (27, 28). Hence, the Ser432 position on rat
CK8 is a putative JNK phosphorylation site. In addition,
phosphorylation of CK8 on Ser431/Ser73 has been shown to protect

Discussion
Chronic exposure to cadmium is associated with increased risk
of cancers (1, 2). Our current knowledge with respect to the actions
of cadmium has been gathered from numerous epidemiologic and
clinical studies encompassing geographically diverse populations
and multiple exposure scenarios. Despite the availability of data,
mechanisms governing the carcinogenic effects have yet to be well
established.
We resolved to use proteomic approach to identify the
responsive proteins that are involved in cadmium adaptation.
Unlike the primary cadmium-responsive proteins (stress proteins),
CK8 and CK14 were up-regulated only in cadmium-adapted cells
but not in cadmium-treated parental cells, suggesting that

Figure 4. A proposed model of cadmium (Cd ) resistance in LECs. Results from
our laboratory showed that cells responded to long-term cadmium exposure
by using diverse antiapoptotic mechanisms (i.e., including perturbation of the
JNK pathway and CK8 overexpression), which could be circumvented by the use
of JNK activator Ro318220 or siRNA-specific knockdown of CK8, respectively,
thereby attenuating cadmium-induced apoptosis (9, 11).

it from ubiquitination (29). Thus, JNK may be involved in regulating
CK8 ubiquitination by phosphorylating CK8. However, besides
bearing the phosphoacceptor site, effective phosphorylation by JNK
is facilitated by the presence of a specific JNK docking site (30, 31).
To see if there is/are any possible JNK docking site(s) in rat CK8,
we compared the docking site sequences of c-Jun and JunB with
that of CK8. It was found that there are two short sequences in
CK8 that resembled these JNK docking sequences (Table 3). It is
possible that, in some cancer cells, CK8/CK18 duplexes may act as
a JNK sequestering complex, thereby causing cytoplasmic retention
of JNK from doing its nuclear tasks. Our results showed that CK8 is
stably up-regulated in cadmium-adapted cell, which may correlate
to the less JNK activation in these cells and result in apoptotic

resistance. However, the hypothesis that the docking of JNK with
CK8 would affect JNK shuttling in our studying model (LECs) will
need to be further investigated.
In conclusion, we postulate that up-regulation of CK8 and CK14
may be responsible for apoptotic resistance in cadmium-adapted
cells. Because CK8 and CK14 are overexpressed in various cancer
cells, it is logical to assume that the elevation of these proteins
could promote neoplastic cell survival as well as subsequent clonal
expansion and then progression of tumor development. On the
other hand, further study is necessary to elucidate the possible
involvement of CK8 and CK14 in cadmium-induced carcinogenesis.
It has been well documented that cancer cells have altered
differentiation programs (keratin profiles) compared with their
normal counterpart (12); however, this phenomenon has not been
fully understood. In our study, we speculate that increased
expression of specific keratins can act as a scaffold to bind to
apoptotic factors, preventing them to do their functions, which
can provide additional survival advantages to evade apoptosis.
Taken together, our previous and current studies showed that
cells responded to long-term cadmium exposure by using diverse
antiapoptotic mechanisms (Fig. 4), thereby attenuating cadmiuminduced apoptosis (9, 11). Our work also initiated ongoing
research on the elucidation of the interactions between keratin
and intracellular signaling as well as a better understanding of the
mechanisms governing epithelial cell transformation.
