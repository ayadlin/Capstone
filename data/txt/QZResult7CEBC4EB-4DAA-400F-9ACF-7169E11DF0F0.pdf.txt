Abstract
Recent clinical successes of small-molecule epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in treating advanced non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have raised hopes that the
identification of other deregulated growth factor pathways in
NSCLC will lead to new therapeutic options for NSCLC. Met,
the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, has been implicated
in growth, invasion, and metastasis of many tumors including
NSCLC. To assess the functional role for Met in NSCLC, we
evaluated a panel of nine lung cancer cell lines for Met gene
amplification, Met expression, Met pathway activation, and
the sensitivity of the cell lines to short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–
mediated Met knockdown. Two cell lines, EBC-1 and H1993,
showed significant Met gene amplification and overexpressed
Met receptors which were constitutively phosphorylated. The
other seven lines did not exhibit Met amplification and
expressed much lower levels of Met, which was phosphorylated
only on addition of hepatocyte growth factor. We also found a
strong up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in B-catenin
and p120/D-catenin in the Met-amplified EBC-1 and H1993 cell
lines. ShRNA-mediated Met knockdown induced significant
growth inhibition, G1-S arrest, and apoptosis in EBC-1 and
H1993 cells, whereas it had little or no effect on the cell lines
that do not have Met amplification. These results strongly
suggest that Met amplification identifies a subset of NSCLC
likely to respond to new molecular therapies targeting Met.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and the
leading cause of cancer-related mortality in North America and
throughout the world. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for f80% of lung cancer (1). Standard therapies for
advanced NSCLC include radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which
confer palliative and moderate survival benefits with significant
toxicities (1). To address the substantial unmet medical needs in
NSCLC, extensive efforts have been made to identify molecular
defects underlying the genesis and progression of NSCLC and to
discover novel therapeutic agents targeting these defects. Recent
clinical success of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors in refractory, advanced NSCLC (2) have raised hopes

that targeting other deregulated growth factor signaling, such as
the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met pathway, will lead to new
therapeutic options for NSCLC.
Met is a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase
composed of an extracellular a-chain disulfide-bonded to a
membrane-spanning h-chain (3, 4). The tyrosine kinase domain
resides in the cytosolic domain of the h-chain (3, 4). Binding of HGF/
SF to Met induces receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation,
triggering conformational changes that activate Met tyrosine kinase
activity (5). The resultant tyrosine phosphorylation of a multisubstrate docking site, located near the COOH terminus of the Met
h-chain, mediates the activation of a number of signaling pathways,
including phosphoinositide-3-kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase 1/AKT, Ras-Rac/Rho, Ras-mitogen-activated protein
kinase, and phospholipase C-g pathways (5). In addition to
proliferative and antiapoptotic activities that are common to many
growth factors, HGF/Met elicits unique motogenenic and morphogenic effects by stimulating cell-cell detachment, migration,
invasiveness, and tubule formation and branching (5).
Aberrant Met signaling has been implicated in the development,
maintenance, and progression of cancers in both animals and
humans (5). Transgenic mice overexpressing HGF develop tumors
in a number of tissues, and tissue-specific transgenic overexpression of Met or HGF causes or promotes malignant
transformation of hepatocytes, airway epithelium, and mammary
epithelium (5). In humans, Met plays a central role in hereditary
papillary renal carcinoma, which is causally related to gain-offunction germ line mutations in the Met tyrosine kinase domain
(6). Gain-of-function Met mutations have also been found in several
nonrenal tumors, including lung cancers (5, 7). Notably, a somatic
intronic mutation in the Met gene has been identified recently in
lung cancer, resulting in a deletion in the juxtamembrane domain
and stimulation of Met-transforming activity in vitro (8). In
addition to mutations, several reports have shown genomic
amplification of Met to occur in 5% to 10% of gastric cancers
(9–11). Recent work has also identified Met amplification in 4% of
esophageal (12) and 4% of lung cancers (13). While this work was
in progress, gastric cancer cell lines with Met amplification were
reported to be dependent on the amplified Met kinase for growth
in vitro, indicating a critical role for Met in in vitro cell growth and
survival (14). Met amplification also has clinical significance in that
both Met gene amplification as well as Met and/or HGF
overexpression have been correlated with poor clinical outcome
in a variety of human cancers (5).
To assess the functional roles of Met in NSCLC, we evaluated a
panel of lung cancer cell lines for Met gene amplification, Met
expression, Met pathway activation, and the sensitivity of the cell
lines to short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated Met knockdown.
ShRNA-mediated Met knockdown induced significant growth
inhibition, G1-S arrest, and apoptosis in cell lines harboring Met

gene amplification, whereas it had little or no effects on the cell
lines that do not have Met amplification. These results suggest that
Met amplification may identify a subset of NSCLC sensitive to
emerging Met inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Cell lines A549, H226, H596, Calu-1, SW900, SK-MES-1, H1048,
and H1993 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). EBC-1 was from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Japan
Health Sciences Foundation, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were maintained in Iscoves
DMEM plus 10% FCS and 40 Ag/mL gentamicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). H1048
growth medium was supplemented with 8 Ag/mL insulin (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY). GTL-16 cells were a gift from S. Giordano and P.M. Comoglio
(University of Torino Medical School, Candiolo, Italy).
Quantitative PCR for analysis of Met genomic amplification.
Quantitative PCR was done on genomic DNA purified using the DNA easy
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Primers and probe used for MET are (5¶ to 3¶)
F-TGTTGCCAAGCTGTATTCTGTTTAC; R-TCTCTGAATTAGAGCGATGTTGACA, VIC-TGGATAATTGTGTCTTTCTCTAG-MGBNFQ (14). Primers and
probe for single-copy reference gene RNase P, which encodes the RNA
moiety for the RNase P enzyme, are a product of Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, CA), as well as TaqMan Universal PCR reagent mix. Reactions were
done in quadruplicate with 20 ng of genomic DNA, primers at 900 nmol/L,
and probes at 250 nmol/L under standard thermocycling conditions (2 min
at 50jC; 10 min at 95jC; 40 cycles of 15 s 92jC; and 1 min 60jC) Data were
normalized to RNase P and then to the calibrator sample (normal lung
genomic DNA; BioChain Institute, Hayward, CA).
ShRNA production and infection. shRNA sequences for Met were M1:
GAAGATCACGAAGATCCCATTCAAGAGATGGGATCTTCGTGATCTTC;
M2: GATCTGGGCAGTGAATTAGTTCAAGAGACTAATTCACTGCCCAGATC; M3: GAGCTGTGATAATATACACTTCAAGAGAGTGTATATTCTCACAGCTC. For FGFR2, GCCAACCTCTCGAACAGTATTCAAGAGATACTGTTCGAGAGGTTGGC, and for luciferase: CACCGGTGTTGTAACAATATCGACGAATCGATATTGTTACAACACCAAAA. These oligonucleotides were
annealed to make double-stranded oligonucleotides with a 5¶ BbsI overhang
and a 3¶ SpeI overhang. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into a
proprietary BbsI/SpeI cut ENTR plasmid (expression from mouse U6
promoter) Gateway technology (Invitrogen) was used to convert into
Plenti6/Block-iT-DEST (Invitrogen).
Virus was produced using the Invitrogen lentiviral expression system as
directed by the supplier with the following exceptions. Plasmids were
transfected into 2.5  107 293FT cells on 15-cm polylysine-coated plates,
and the supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h posttransfection. Titer was
determined using colony formation under blasticidin selection as described
by Invitrogen (Invitrogen lentiviral expression system). Lentiviral infection
was at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for EBC-1 and MOI of 20 for
the remaining cell lines. For growth analysis, cells were seeded at 4000 cells
per well in 96-well plates, whereas for Western analysis, cells were seeded at
40,000 cells in 12-well plates. Viral supernatants were added for 14 to 16 h in
the presence of 6 Ag/mL polybrene, at which point viral supernatants were
removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and replaced with growth
medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum.
Proliferation analysis. Cell growth was analyzed using the Vialight
assay kit (Cambrex, Rockland, ME). For some assays, independent analysis
by cell counting on a hematocytometer confirmed the results of Vialight.
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, antibodies, and growth
factors. After removing growth medium, tissue culture dishes were placed
on ice and lysis buffer containing 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH, 7.5), 50 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, 30 mmol/L NaPPi, 1% Triton, 0.5%
IGEPAL, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L vanadate, 1 mmol/L bpPhen (Calbiochem,
San Diego, CA), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)
was added with shaking for 10 min at 4jC. Cells were scraped from dishes,
transferred to Eppendorf tubes followed by freezing at 70jC, thawing, and
clarification of cellular debris by centrifugation at 20,000  g for 5 min at
4jC. SDS-PAGE was on 40 Ag of cell lysates, and Western blotting followed

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

standard procedures. For h-catenin immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate
was incubated with 2 Ag of antibody for 1 h, then 15 AL of agaroseconjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West
Grove, PA) was added, and the incubation was continued overnight. The
next day, the beads were pelleted and washed thrice in lysis buffer plus
phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Proteins were eluted by boiling in
Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The following
antibodies were used: Met 25H2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or
AF276 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); Y1349 Met, Y1234,1235 Met, Y845
EGFR, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) 473, AKT, pERK, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3
(8G10), and h-actin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Y1173
EGFR antibody was from Biosource Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). 4G10
phosphotyrosine was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Antibody to Y228 ycatenin was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Antibody to
delta catenin was C4864 from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). h-Catenin
antibody sc7199 and isoform-specific antibodies for K-ras (sc-30), H-ras (sc520), and N-ras (sc-31) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). Recombinant HGF was from R&D Systems.
Met protein levels were quantitated relative to actin using densitometry
(Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and Image Quant software.
Ras activation assays. Ras activation was assayed using a Ras activation
kit (Upstate), which uses glutathione S-transferase-Raf to precipitate active
Ras from cell lysates. Three hundred to 600 Ag of cell lysates were used, and
binding and washing were according to kit procedures.
Flow cytometry. A Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ) FACS Calibur
was used for flow cytometry. A total of 500,000 cells were infected with virus
and analyzed at the indicated time points. Nonadherent cells were collected
and combined with trypsinized adherent cells. Cells were centrifuged at
250  g, washed in PBS, and fixed overnight in 1 mL ice-cold 70% ethanol.
Cells were then washed in PBS and stained with PI/RNase solution (BD
PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 1 h overnight. ModFit software was used to
determine the relative distribution in G1, S, G2-M, and manual gating to
determine the sub-G1 content.
Receptor tyrosine kinase array. Array 001 (R&D Systems) was used
according to supplier protocols to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor
tyrosine kinases. This array contains 42 receptor tyrosine kinase capture
antibodies spotted in duplicate. Briefly, 50 Ag of cell lysates were incubated
with the membrane overnight in the provided buffer. Target proteins are
captured by their respective antibodies. After washing, incubation with a
phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase allows the
detection of captured receptor tyrosine kinases that are tyrosine
phosphorylated. A more detailed description of this array is provided in
the Supplementary Data.

Results
We determined the protein expression levels and activation
status of Met in nine NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1A). The H1993 and
EBC-1 cell lines expressed high levels of Met and contained high
basal phosphorylation in both activation loop tyrosines (Y1234/
1235) and a docking site tyrosine (Y1349). The high basal
phosphorylation at Y1349 was minimally stimulated by HGF
(2.5-fold and 1.7-fold in EBC-1 and H1993, respectively), whereas
the high levels of Y1234/1235 phosphorylation were not further
stimulated by HGF in either cell line. By contrast, the other cell
lines in our panel expressed much lower levels of Met, which was
phosphorylated at Y1234/1235 and Y1349 only on ligand addition.
Met expression relative to actin is indicated in Fig. 1A below the
Met panel. H1993 has been reported to contain genomic
amplification of Met (13), whereas a comparative genomic
hybridization database (link provided in Supplementary Data)
revealed high copy number at the Met locus in the EBC-1 cell line.
We verified Met amplification in EBC-1 and H1993, similar to
GTL-16 gastric cancer cells previously shown to have Met

amplification (15), and found no amplification in the remaining
cell lines (Fig. 1B).
We determined whether signaling pathways active in the ligandindependent Met-amplified cells are similar to the pathways
activated by HGF in the non–Met-amplified cells. Although both
EBC-1 and H1993 cells contain basal phosphorylation in pERK and
pAKT that is not stimulated by HGF, the levels of activated ERK
were much higher in nonamplified lines stimulated by HGF
(Fig. 2A). Also in striking contrast to the nonamplified lines, we
found highly elevated tyrosine phosphorylation in h-catenin and
y-catenin only in the Met-amplified lines (Fig. 2A). In addition, we
observed high levels of activated ras in EBC-1 and H1993 cells,
although this was similar to other cells in the panel (Fig. 2B).
Interestingly, the amount of activated ras in EBC-1 and H1993 was
similar to levels found in A549, which is homozygous for mutant
K-ras, as well as Calu-1, which contains a heterozygous mutant of
K-ras (16). EBC-1 has wild-type ras isoforms,1 and H1993 K-ras was
also reported be wild type (17). Using isoform-specific antibodies,
we found that the activated ras isoform in EBC-1 and H1993 is

exclusively K-ras (data not shown). Thus, both EBC-1 and H1993
cells have activated signaling pathways that, in some cases, are
qualitatively and quantitatively dissimilar from pathways activated
by HGF stimulation.
We next determined whether Met was important for NSCLC cell
line growth. We used lentiviral vectors to deliver Met shRNA to
EBC-1 and H1993 cells and found efficient knockdown of Met
protein 72 h after infection (Fig. 3A). We also observed protein
knockdown as early as 24 h after virus removal (see Fig. 4B). The
Met shRNA M3 was highly efficient in decreasing Met protein
(Fig. 3A), with M1 and M2 having less effect. A time course of
growth inhibition with the potent Met shRNA M3 in H1993 and
EBC-1 cells revealed that treated EBC-1 cells sustained a loss of
f50% of the starting cell number within 48 to 72 h of virus
removal (Fig. 3C, EBC-1). Although Met knockdown in H1993 cells
did not result in a decrease in starting cell numbers, there was still
no significant increase in cell number from the time of virus
removal (Fig. 3B, H1993). To test for specificity of growth inhibition
by Met shRNA, we treated the remaining cell lines in our panel with
the M3 shRNA, and we tested each of the three Met shRNAs for
growth inhibition in EBC-1, H1993, and A549 cells. Met shRNA
treatment resulted in growth inhibition in EBC-1 and H1993 cells

is activated in EBC and H1993 cells.
A, lysates used in Fig. 1 were analyzed
by Western blotting for the indicated
phosphorylated or total proteins
(Akt, Erk, p120 y-catenin). h-Catenin was
immunoprecipitated from the indicated
lysates (100 Ag) and Western blotted with
4G10 for phosphotyrosine content. B, Ras
activation was done on separate samples
(5  106 cells) using the lysis buffer
provided by the kit as described in
Materials and Methods. H1048 and SW900
lysates were not available for analysis of
Ras activation. This panel is an adjoining of

that corresponded to the amount of protein knockdown in Fig. 3A.
Proliferation in A549 and the remaining cell lines was not inhibited
by Met shRNA treatment (Fig. 3C), despite efficient knockdown of
Met (Fig. 3D). Although H1048 and Calu-1 showed minor growth
inhibition, we note that the cell numbers in these lines increased
4-fold when treated with M3 shRNA (data not shown), which is in
contrast to the potent inhibition seen in H1993 and EBC-1.
In addition to the effects on cell growth, Met shRNA resulted in a
dramatic morphologic change in H1993 and EBC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1); at 12 h after virus removal, the majority of cells
had converted from rounded and poorly adherent to a flattened
and adherent appearance. These morphology changes were not
observed in untreated or control (luciferase or FGFR2 hairpin)
lentivirus-treated cells.
Finally, flow cytometry was used to characterize the cell cycle
profile of EBC-1 and H1993 cells treated with Met shRNA M3
(Fig. 4A). Within 24 h of virus removal, both EBC-1 and H1993 cells
sustained a 3- to 4-fold reduction of cells in the S phase, such
that the percentage of S-phase cells was decreased from 19%
(in EBC-1) and 17% (in H1993) to 5% in each. This decrease in
S phase persisted through the time course, suggesting that the cell
cycle was blocked at G1-S. At 48 and 72 h, there was an increase
in cells in sub-G1 that was most prominent for EBC-1 (6-fold
induction at 72 h), indicative of cell death. This increase in the
percentage of sub-G1 cells is consistent with the decrease in cell
number observed in Fig. 3B. In addition, both cell lines had a
strong decrease in the G2-M population at 48 and 72 h, consistent
with a loss of cycling cells, but also suggesting that Met inhibition
does not result in a block at G2-M. The increased sub-G1
population prominent in EBC-1 cells suggested an increase in
apoptosis in these cells. Western blotting in EBC-1 cells indeed
revealed the presence of cleaved PARP, an indicator of apoptosis, at
24 and 48 h (Fig. 4B). H1993 also revealed cleaved PARP, but to a
lesser extent than EBC-1 cells, starting at 72 h after virus removal

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

(Fig. 4B). The cleaved PARP was also accompanied by cleaved
caspase-3 (data not shown).
Having shown that EBC-1 and H1993 cells require Met for
growth, we next determined whether key signaling pathways were
also inhibited after Met shRNA treatment. Twenty-four hours after
M3 virus removal, the knockdown of Met protein was accompanied
by a loss of tyrosine phosphorylation in y-catenin and h-catenin,
pAKT, and pERK, each accompanied by only minimal changes in
protein levels (Fig. 5). There was also an almost complete loss of
activated ras upon knockdown of Met (Fig. 5). These results reveal
that for H1993 and EBC-1 cells, the loss of a single kinase, Met,
causes a cessation of multiple signaling pathways and results in
profound growth and morphology changes.
Given the role of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in cell
growth, we were interested to determine if other receptor tyrosine
kinases were also active in the Met-amplified cells. We used a
receptor tyrosine kinase array (Fig. 6A) and found that EGFR1 and
Met were the predominant activated receptor tyrosine kinases in
EBC-1 and H1993 cells. Surprisingly, the basal levels of phosphorylation in the EGFR activation site (Y845) and the SHC/PTP1
docking site (Y1173) were lost upon Met knockdown, with minimal
change in the EGFR protein levels (Fig. 6B). Thus, the activation of
EGFR1 in H1993 and EBC-1 cell lines was not a result of EGF
present in serum, which is also supported by our finding that A549
growing in 10% serum require exogenous EGF to attain significant
phosphorylation of EGFR (data not shown). Furthermore, this
result suggests EGFR is a downstream signaling component of
amplified Met kinase.

Discussion
In this work, we describe a critical function for the Met kinase in
cancer cell proliferation and viability. For the subset of lung cancer
cell lines with Met gene amplification, Met is highly activated, and

cell proliferation and survival are dependent on this activated Met
kinase. By contrast, cells with non-amplified Met have very low levels
of basal Met activation and are not dependent on Met for growth.
The non–Met-amplified H596 cell line included in our analysis
contains an oncogenic juxtamembrane deletion in Met (consistent
with reduced SDS-PAGE mobility in Fig. 1; ref. 8). Although this

mutation can enhance Met transformation in response to HGF
stimulation (8) and may be a factor for in vivo tumor growth, it does
not constitutively activate Met kinase activity and is not required for
in vitro proliferation under standard growth conditions.
Our work thus defines the importance of amplified Met for
NSCLC growth. While this work was in progress, another group

found that Met amplification is critical for gastric cancer cell
growth (14). The expression levels of Met in H1993 and EBC-1 are
similar to Met expression levels in the Met-amplified gastric cancer
cell lines SNU5, MKN45, HS746t, and GTL-16 (data not shown).
Neither these gastric cell lines nor EBC-1 and H1993 cell lines
secrete HGF as assayed by a lack of scatter activity from cell
supernatants (data not shown). Mutation does not account for
activation because Met is wild type in GTL-16 cells (15), and
Smolen et al. (14) reported that Met is wild type in SNU5, MKN45,
HS746T, and KATOII Met-amplified gastric cancer cell lines. Thus,
the activation of amplified Met could result from highly expressed
receptor clustering independent of ligand.
Met has previously been reported to contribute to the growth of
non–Met-amplified cell lines, including the colon cancer cell lines
KM20 (18), prostate cancer cell line PC3 (19), and the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line SJRH30 (20). Both KM20 and PC3 cells contain
low levels of basal Met phosphorylation, and a proprietary Met
small-molecule inhibitor does not inhibit the growth of PC3, KM20,
or SJRH30 cell lines, whereas both EBC-1 and H1993 (and Metamplified gastric cancer cell lines) are potently growth inhibited
(data not shown). It is possible that Met protein-protein interactions are important for the growth of KM20, PC3, and SJRH30
cell lines, such that the loss of Met protein (as opposed to the loss
of kinase activity) is required to inhibit growth in vitro.
Interestingly, we found that the amplified Met kinase can
activate signaling pathways differently from HGF stimulation.
Although ERK signaling is activated in the Met-amplified lines, the
level of activation is much lower than that found in HGFstimulated non–Met-amplified lines. By contrast, both p120/ycatenin and h-catenin contained a striking increase in tyrosine
phosphorylation only in the Met-amplified cell lines. HGF has
been suggested to activate h-catenin signaling in primary cells (21),
and a link between constitutively activated Met and tyrosinephosphorylated h-catenin was suggested by Danilkovitch-Miagkova
et al. (22). In this work exogenous expression of a mutationally
activated Met (M1268T mutant) activates tyrosine phosphorylation
in h-catenin, resulting in nuclear translocation and activation of
target genes such as myc (22). In addition to a role in proliferation,
h-catenin can function in cell adhesion through interactions with
cadherin family members and the actin cytoskeleton (23, 24).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

Increased tyrosine phosphorylation in h-catenin has also been
reported to correlate with a disruption of cell adhesion (25). In
contrast to h-catenin, a link between Met and p120/y-catenin has
not been previously described. Although the function of p120/
y-catenin has been less well characterized, this catenin family
member has recently been shown to cooperate with h-catenin to

cell lysate from H1993 and EBC-1 cells was incubated overnight with the
ARY001 membrane, followed by washing and detection as described in Materials
and Methods. B, cells were treated with Met shRNA M3, luciferase shRNA or

activate h-catenin target gene transcription (26). These studies
warrant further investigation of amplified Met kinase in the
function of cell-cell adhesion components.
Because we did not observe tyrosine phosphorylation in
h-catenin or p120/y-catenin after HGF stimulation, it is possible
that the combined activation of EGFR and Met may be required for
this effect. Surprisingly, we found that the basal level of
phosphorylation in the activation site and the Y1173 docking site
in EGFR was dependent on Met in EBC-1 and H1993 cells. This
suggests that EGFR is phosphorylated by Met in Met-amplified
cell lines and reveals that the knockdown of Met results in a loss of
aspects of EGFR signaling as well. Although previous work has
suggested that activation of EGFR can result in the activation of
Met phosphorylation, we did not observe phosphorylation of Met
at Y1349 in the HCC827 cell line, which contains both EGFR
amplification and mutation (data not shown). In addition to EBC-1

and H1993 cells, we also found EGFR basal phosphorylation in Metamplified gastric cancer cell lines, and where tested (GTL-16 cells),
EGFR phosphorylation was dependent on Met (data not shown).
Thus, it seems that the relationship between amplified Met and
EGFR activation may be common to Met-amplified cancer cell
lines. However, the role of EGFR in the growth of Met-amplified
cancer cell lines remains to be determined. Smolen et al. (14)
reported that transient EGFR small interfering RNA did not affect
the growth of Met-amplified SNU5 gastric cells. We observed minor
growth inhibition in H1993 cells on transient shRNA knockdown of
EGFR1, as well as in stable lines with EGFR knockdown, suggesting
that EGFR is contributing to growth in H1993 cells (data not
shown). Curiously, we were unable to significantly inhibit basal
EGFR phosphorylation in Met-amplified cell lines with the EGFR
inhibitor gefitinib (data not shown).
The multistep hypothesis of cancer development (27) proposes
that multiple gain of function and loss of function alterations are
required to transform a normal cell to malignancy. In contrast, we
have shown that for a subset of Met-amplified cancer cells, cell
proliferation is dependent on a single activated tyrosine kinase.
However, in support of this hypothesis, we have shown that
multiple oncogenic pathways are activated by Met kinase in Met
amplified cell lines. Ras alleles are wild type in both EBC-1 and
H1993 cells, but ras is activated similarly to the homozygous
mutant K-ras in A549 cells. As described above, intense tyrosine
phosphorylation of catenin family members was found only in Metamplified cells. Finally, both EBC-1 and H1993 cell lines have a
basal level of phosphorylation in EGFR1, which is dependent on
Met, and which may be contributing to cell growth. Thus, amplified
Met activates multiple signaling pathways that, in combination,
may be sufficient for oncogenesis.
Our results and those of Smolen et al. (14) regarding Met,
combined with previous work for EGFR (28–31) and Her2 (32, 33),
show that cancer cell lines can be dependent on a single amplified
receptor tyrosine kinase for viability and growth. This requirement
for growth in vitro may correlate with in vivo growth in patients. In
fact, recent evidence suggests that the amplification of EGFR in
lung and colon cancer is significantly associated with survival and
response rates after EGFR inhibitor therapy (2, 28, 34). It will be of
interest to determine whether patients with amplified Met kinase
have clinical responses to Met inhibitors similar to those observed
for EGFR and Her2 inhibitors in cancers with respective EGFR and
Her2 amplification (2, 35).
