BACKGROUND: Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of many tyrosine kinase receptors. The
authors previously detected c-Cbl mutation and low protein expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, it was hypothesized that overexpression of wild-type c-Cbl (c-Cbl WT) exhibits tumor growth inhibition. METHODS: Wound healing and transwell assays were conducted to examine cell motility after c-Cbl WT transfection in
NSCLC cell lines. The cell cycle was investigated by flow cytometry. A549 and H1299-Luc c-Cbl WT-transfected xenografts and experimental metastasis models were performed to investigate tumor growth and metastasis inhibition
in vivo. RESULTS: Wound healing and transwell assays demonstrated inhibition of migration in the A549 and H226br
cells 4 to 24 hours after transfection. Ectopic c-Cbl WT expression was found to reduce cell proliferation at 48 hours
in A549 cells. It is important to note that A549 and H1299-Luc cells with ectopic c-Cbl WT expression demonstrated
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. A549 cells overexpressing c-Cbl WT inhibited tumor metastasis in animal models.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate that c-Cbl WT
protein overexpression inhibits tumor metastasis and tumor growth in lung cancer xenograft models. These results
provide evidence that ectopic expression of c-Cbl WT protein can be potentially applied as targeted therapy for the

Overexpression of tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) has been detected in lung cancer.1,2 Therefore, promotion

of a degradation system of RTKs is a new approach for tumor growth inhibition.3 Many studies indicate that Casitas
B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) plays an important role in the down-regulation of RTKs through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.4,5 The Cbl family, especially c-Cbl protein, also is associated with the endocytosis mechanism and thus plays a crucial
role in the termination of signaling RTKs such as c-Met and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).6
c-Cbl mutations were first reported in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other types of leukemia.7,8 To the
best of our knowledge, our previous study was the first to report that the c-Cbl mutation also occurred in solid tumors.
Our data indicated that overexpression of c-Cbl mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines led to
increased cell proliferation and motility.9 A recent study demonstrated that mutation or knockdown of c-Cbl induced cell
migration in breast cancer.10 Therefore, we hypothesized that the overexpression of wild-type c-Cbl (c-Cbl WT) may exhibit tumor inhibition.

human bronchial cell line, BEAS-2B, was obtained from
Dr. P.-C. Yang (Department of Internal Medicine,
National Taiwan University).
Vector constructs were previously described by Tan
et al.9 The cells were transfected with c-Cbl WT vector or
empty vector control using ExGen500 transfection reagent (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, Md). After 48 hours, cells
were collected for Western blot analysis, cell proliferation,
migration assays, and animal studies.
Western Blot Analysis, Tissue Western Blot
Analysis, and Immunofluorescence Assay
Immunoblotting was performed for various proteins
using the conditions described: c-Cbl, 1:200; phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) (Tyr1173), 1:200; signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, Calif); phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) (Ser473), 1:1000; AKT, 1:1000; phosphorylated Met (pMet) (Tyr-1234/Tyr-1235), 1:500; Met, 1:1000; EGFR,
1:500; phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) (Tyr-705),
1:2000; phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) (Thr-202/Tyr204), 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc, Danvers,
Mass); ERK, 1:1000; RAS, 1:1000 (Upstate, Billerica,
Mass); phosphorylated Src (p-Src) (Tyr-416), 1:2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif); Src, 1:1000 (obtained from
Dr. T.-H. Leu, Department of Pharmacology, National
Cheng Kung University); phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK)
(Tyr-397), 1:200; FAK, 1:1000; and b-actin, 1:5000
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK). For tissue Western blot analysis, xenografts were collected after mice sacrifice, homogenized with CelLytic TMMT lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation, St. Louis, Mo), and used for immunoblotting. Pericellular polyfibronectin assemblies were detected
with antifibronectin (1:600; Sigma-Aldrich)11 using
bright field and fluorescent microscopy.

ronment. Transfected A549 cells (1  106) in a volume of
200 lL were injected through the tail vein for in vivo experimental metastasis analysis. The mice were euthanized
at the indicated times and lung tumors were photographed with a digital camera. For the tumor growth inhibition assay, transfected A549 or H1299-Luc cells (5 
106) in a volume of 100 lL were implanted subcutaneously
into the mice. The size of the tumor mass was measured
and the tumor volume was calculated as 1/2  length 
width2 in mm3 for the A549 xenograft. The growth of the
H1299-Luc xenograft was observed under an IVIS-50 in
vivo imaging system (Xenogen Biosciences Corporation,
Cranbury, NJ) after injection of an endotoxin-free luciferase substrate (VivoGlo; Promega Corporation, Madison,
Wis). The body weight of the mice was measured. Tumors
were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H &
E) for further pathological confirmation.
Statistical Analysis
For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
the Sidak adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving measurements over time were analyzed
using repeated measures ANOVA with the GreenhouseGeisser adjustment.

RESULTS
Ectopic Expression of c-Cbl WT Inhibits Cell
Proliferation and Motility
Western blot analysis was performed to examine expression of the c-Cbl protein in various lung cancer cell lines.
H2171, H249, A549, H226br, AS2, and H1975 cells
demonstrated lower c-Cbl expression than BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). Therefore, A549 and
H226br cells were selected as the cell models to be used for
further investigation. Transient transfection with 8 lg of cCbl WT was used for all assays because it demonstrated the
highest expression of ectopic c-Cbl protein (Fig. 1B). The
cell growth results indicated that c-Cbl WT inhibited cell
proliferation (Fig. 1C) and induced a sub-G1 population
(Fig. 1D), possibly via reduction of the total c-Met protein
level and AKT/ERK survival signaling (Fig. 1E) in A549
cells at 48 hours after transfection.
We performed wound healing and transwell migration assays on A549 and H226br cells that were transiently transfected with c-Cbl WT expression vector. The
wound gaps of c-Cbl WT transfection in both the A549
and H226br cells all were significantly larger than noted
in control cells transfected with empty vector at 24 hours

after transfection (Fig. 2A). A transwell migration assay
confirmed that c-Cbl WT expression inhibited the migration ability of both cell lines (Fig. 2B). Ectopic expression
of c-Cbl WT in A549 cells inhibited FAK signaling (Fig.

surface (Fig. 2D) at 48 hours after transfection compared
with the control cells.
c-Cbl WT Transfection Effectively Inhibits
Tumor Growth in an Animal Model
To examine whether c-Cbl WT could inhibit tumor
growth in vivo, we first transfected c-Cbl WT into A549
or H1299-Luc cells and implanted them subcutaneously
into nude mice. Animals with the A549 xenograft
expressed c-Cbl WT, resulting in a significant reduction

in tumor mass compared with the control group without
changes in body weight (Figs. 3A and 3B). Tissue Western
blot analyses demonstrated that ectopically expressed
c-Cbl WT remained overexpressed at 44 days after xenograft implantation (Fig. 3D). c-Cbl WT transfectioninduced antitumor growth was confirmed by a reduction
in luciferase intensity in the H1299-Luc xenograft
(Fig. 3C).

lung tissue could be examined. The c-Cbl WT transfection group demonstrated a significant decrease in metastatic lung tissue weight compared with the control group
(Figs. 4A and 4B). H & E staining results demonstrated
that the number and size of the metastatic tumor colonies
in the lungs of nude mice receiving control A549 cells
were significantly higher than in those receiving c-Cbl
WT-expressing A549 cells (Fig. 4C).

DISCUSSION
The c-Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase induces internalization
and ubiquitination of RTKs such as c-Met and
EGFR.7 The signaling experiment using Western blot
analyses demonstrated that overexpression of c-Cbl

5348

WT decreased the total c-Met protein level but not
that of EGFR. This might be because c-Cbl represents
only one aspect of EGFR post-translational regulation.12 Further studies to examine whether transduction of c-Cbl WT is also effective in NSCLC cells
with c-Met overexpression or an EGFR mutation are
warranted.
c-Cbl has been shown to target other kinases,
including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), colonystimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and Src.13 c-Cbl also functions as a signal transduction molecule affecting pathways
such as RAS, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT,
and STAT.13 Although we did not observe changes in
RAS and p-STAT status, we cannot rule out other potential effects as contributing factors.

To the best of our knowledge, the current study is
the first to demonstrate that ectopic expression of c-Cbl
WT inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in lung cancer
in vivo. c-Cbl WT-induced inhibition of tumor growth
may be mediated by down-regulation of p-AKT (survival)
and p-ERK1/2 (proliferation and differentiation) signaling.13 In addition, an antimetastasis effect may occur
through inhibition of p-FAK (motility control) and pericellular polyfibronectin assemblies (tumor colonization).11 Loss of c-Cbl function in individuals with AML
and myelodysplastic syndrome supports the potential
clinical therapeutic value of c-Cbl WT gene therapy in
patients with hematologic malignancies in addition to
those with lung cancer.
