Abstract
Bcl-XL is a major antiapoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family whose overexpression is more widely observed in
human lung cancer cells than that of Bcl-2, suggesting that Bcl-XL is more biologically relevant and therefore a
better therapeutic target for lung cancer. Here, we screened small molecules that selectively target the BH3
domain (aa 90–98) binding pocket of Bcl-XL using the UCSF DOCK 6.1 program suite and the NCI chemical library
database. We identiﬁed two new Bcl-XL inhibitors (BXI-61 and BXI-72) that exhibit selective toxicity against lung
cancer cells compared with normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Fluorescence polarization assay reveals that
BXI-61 and BXI-72 preferentially bind to Bcl-XL protein but not Bcl2, Bcl-w, Bﬂ-1/A1, or Mcl-1 in vitro with high
binding afﬁnities. Treatment of cells with BXI-72 results in disruption of Bcl-XL/Bak or Bcl-XL/Bax interaction,
oligomerization of Bak, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Importantly, BXI-61 and BXI-72 exhibit
more potent efﬁcacy against human lung cancer than ABT-737 but less degree in platelet reduction in vivo. BXI-72
overcomes acquired radioresistance of lung cancer. On the basis of our ﬁndings, the development of BXI(s) as a
new class of anticancer agents is warranted and represents a novel strategy for improving lung cancer outcome.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
the United States, accounting for 28% of the total estimated
cancer deaths (1). The estimated cancer-related mortality from
lung cancer alone has surpassed the combined mortality from
prostate (11%), colon (9%), and pancreatic cancer (6%) in male
patients with cancer (1). The 2 major categories of lung cancer,
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 85%), and small cell lung
cancer (SCLC; 15%), both have very dismal overall survival
rates of 16% and 6%, respectively. Despite recent therapeutic
advances, virtually all patients with advanced NSCLCs eventually develop resistance to currently available cytotoxic and
targeted therapy (2–4).
One of the well-known hallmarks of cancer is the dysregulation of programmed cell death (i.e., apoptosis), resulting in
evasion of apoptosis (5). Impaired apoptosis is a critical step in
tumor development and renders the tumor cells more resistant

to conventional cytotoxic therapy. Despite the frequent dysregulation of apoptosis in tumors, nearly all tumors maintain
the core apoptotic regulatory machinery: Bcl2 family proteins,
cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases, etc. Among the components of
the apoptotic machinery, overexpression of the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 plays
critical roles in mediating resistance to apoptosis induced by
chemotherapy or radiotherapy (6). Elevated expression levels
of antiapoptotic Bcl2 family proteins have been observed in
lung cancers and are associated with chemo- and radioresistance and poor prognosis (3, 4). Bcl-XL, an antiapoptotic
member of the Bcl2 family, is widely expressed in both SCLC
and NSCLC cells (4, 7, 8). Bcl-XL also plays important roles in
the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis (9). Expression
of Bcl-XL is associated with resistance against chemotherapeutic agents (4). Therefore, an attempt to overcome this
inherent resistance against apoptosis by inactivating Bcl-XL
is a very attractive approach for anticancer therapeutics.
Several small-molecule BH3 mimetic compounds such as
ABT-737, ABT-263 (the oral form of ABT-737), AT-101, GX15070, and TW-37 have been developed and evaluated in clinical
trials with limited success (8, 10–21). Although ABT-737 is
considered a potent anticancer drug, cancer cells expressing
high levels of endogenous Bcl-XL exhibit dramatically less
sensitivity to ABT-737 (17, 18, 22). To overcome the limitations
of currently available Bcl-2 inhibitors for lung cancer treatment, we have developed 2 additional effective anticancer
agents (BXI-61 and BXI-72) that speciﬁcally target Bcl-XL for
the treatment of lung cancers and, potentially, other cancers
with high expression levels of endogenous Bcl-XL. Our ﬁndings
show the efﬁcacy of BXIs in potently repressing lung cancer

150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5
mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT)] in a 96-well assay plate. The
plate was mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated at
room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. Polarization,
deﬁned as millipolarization units (mP), was measured at room
temperature with a ﬂuorescence microplate reader at 485/
530 nm (Gemini XPS, Molecular Devices). A negative control
[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 3 nmol/L peptide and assay
buffer] and a positive control (DMSO, 3 nmol/L peptide, 6
nmol/L Bcl-XL and assay buffer) were used to determine the
range of the assay. The percentage of inhibition was determined by the equation: 1  [(mP value of well  negative
control)/range)]  100%. Inhibitory constant (Ki) value was
determined by the formula: Ki ¼ [I]50/([L]50/Kd þ [P]0/Kd þ 1)
as described (27). Reported values are the mean  SD for 3
separate experiments run in duplicate.
Cytochrome c release and Bak oligomerization
Subcellular fractionation for isolation of mitochondria and
cytosol was conducted as previously described (28). cyt c was
analyzed by Western blotting. Bak oligomerization was analyzed as described (29). Brieﬂy, 10 mmol/L BMH was added to
the mitochondrial fraction dissolved in conjugation buffer
(PBS, pH7.2) and 5 mmol/L EDTA was added for crosslinking
between sulfhydryl groups of Bak proteins. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The
reaction was stopped by adding quench solution (1 mol/L
DTT) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction
product was subjected to SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by
Western blotting using a Bak antibody.

Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 6  103 to 8  103 per well in
96-well plates and allowed to grow overnight. Cells were
treated with BXI or other agent(s) for 72 hours. The surviving
cell fraction was determined using the sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay as described (24).

Establishment of irradiation-resistant cell lines
We chose A549, H157, and H358 cell lines to establish
ionizing radiation–resistant lung cancer cell lines (A549-IRR,
H157-IRR, and H358-IRR) as described (30). Brieﬂy, A549,
H157, and H358 cells (1  106) were serially irradiated with 2
Gy of X-rays to a ﬁnal dose of 80 Gy using X-RAD 320
(Precision X-ray, Inc.). Culture medium was renewed immediately after each dose of radiation. After growing to approximately 90% conﬂuence, cells were trypsinized and passaged
into new culture dishes. Re-irradiation of the newly passaged
cells with 2 Gy of X-rays occurred at about 60% conﬂuence
and this was repeated 40 times over a period of 5 months,
for a total dose of 80 Gy. The parental cells (A549-P, H157-P,
and H358-P) were trypsinized, counted, and passaged under
the same conditions without ionizing irradiation as described (30).

Fluorescence polarization assay
Fluorescent Bak BH3 domain peptide (FAM-GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR) and Bcl-XL protein were purchased from NeoBioSci. To measure the binding afﬁnity of BXI to Bcl-XL
protein, a competition ﬂuorescence polarization assay was
used as previously described (25–27). Fluorescent Bak BH3
domain peptide (3 nmol/L) was incubated with puriﬁed,
human Bcl-XL protein (6 nmol/L) in the absence or presence
of increasing concentrations (i.e., 0.1–500 nmol/L) of BXI (s)
in the binding afﬁnity assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0),

Lung cancer xenografts and treatments
Six-week-old female nu/nu nude mice were purchased from
Harlan and housed under pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages. All animal treatments were undertaken in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University (Atlanta,
GA). 3  106 H1299 cells in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS, Gibco) were injected into subcutaneous tissue at the
ﬂank region of nude mice. The tumors were allowed to grow to
an average volume of about 250 mm3 before initiation of

therapy as described (18). Mice were treated with BXI-72 or
BXI-61 intraperitoneally (i.p.) as indicated. For radiotherapy,
mice with A549 parental (A549-P) or A549 irradiation–resistant (A549-IRR) xenografts were irradiated with 2 Gy every
other day for 5 treatments using an X-RAD 320 irradiator
(Precision X-ray) to deliver whole-body irradiation to the mice
at a rate of 0.8 Gy/min as described (31). During treatment,
tumor volume (V) was measured by caliper measurements
once every 2 days and calculated with the formula: V ¼ (L 
W2)/2 (L is the length and W is the width). Mice were sacriﬁced by inhaled CO2 at the end of treatment. Harvested tumors
were weighed and immediately ﬁxed in formalin for immunohistochemistry.
Mouse blood analysis
Whole blood (250 mL) was collected in EDTA-coated tubes
via cardiac puncture of anesthetized mice for hematology
studies. Specimens were analyzed for white blood cells (WBC),
red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea
nitrogen (BUN) in the Clinical Pathology Laboratory at the
University of Georgia (Athens, GA).
Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences between groups
was analyzed with 2-sided unpaired Student t test or Fisher
exact test. Results were considered statistically signiﬁcant at
P < 0.05. The IC50 values were calculated using SPSS Statistics
software 18 (IBM). All data are presented as mean  SD.

Results
Screening of small-molecule BXIs that target the BH3
domain of Bcl-XL (aa 90–98) and suppress lung cancer
cell growth
Our ﬁndings and those of others have shown that Bcl-XL is
more widely expressed than Bcl2 in SCLC and NSCLC cell lines
(Fig. 1A; refs. 4, 7, 8), suggesting that Bcl-XL may be a more
biologically relevant therapeutic target for lung cancer. To
screen for small molecules that speciﬁcally target Bcl-XL, a
library containing approximately 300,000 small molecules from
the NCI was used to dock the structural pocket of the BH3
domain (aa90–98; accession number: 1LXL and 1MAZ) using
the UCSF DOCK 6.1 program suite as described (32). The small
molecules were ranked according to their energy scores. The
top 200 small molecules were selected for screening of cytotoxicity in human lung cancer cells (i.e., H1299 or A549 cells) by
SRB assay. Among these small molecules, 2 compounds (i.e.,
NSC354961 and NSC334072) had the most potent activities
against human lung cancer cells. We named these 2 lead
compounds Bcl-XL inhibitor BXI-61 (C20H19ClN7O, MW:
408.86) and BXI-72 (C27H29ClN6O, MW: 489.01). In this report,
we focus on characterizing BXI-61 and BXI-72. The molecular
modeling of these 2 leads in complex with Bcl-XL is shown
in Fig. 1B. To compare sensitivities of BXIs with ABT-737 in
human lung cancer cells, A549, H159, and H1299 cells were
treated with increasing concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30
mmol/L) of BXI-61, BXI-72, or ABT-737 for 72 hours. The
surviving cell fraction was determined using SRB assay as
described (33). SRB assay estimates cell density based on the

their binding to Bcl-XL (Fig. 2). Similar ABT-737 binding
afﬁnities were observed for Bcl2 and Bcl-XL (Fig. 2). In contrast,
BXI-61 and BXI-72 bind signiﬁcantly tighter to Bcl-XL than
Bcl2. This suggests that BXI-61 and BXI-72 speciﬁcally target
Bcl-XL.

Bcl-XL is a required target for BXI suppression of human
lung cancer growth
To further test whether Bcl-XL is an essential target for BXI
suppression of human lung cancer, endogenous Bcl-XL was
knocked down by RNA interference using Bcl-XL short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) in H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Approximately 50% to 60% of cells died following transfection with
Bcl-XL shRNA at 48 hours. The surviving cells that remained
were selected by puromycin for stable clones. The selected
stable clones were then identiﬁed by Western blotting and
treated with BXI compounds. As expected, the effect of Bcl-XL
shRNA on Bcl-XL expression was highly speciﬁc, as shown by
the control shRNA having no effect (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Colony formation assay revealed that depletion of endogenous
Bcl-XL signiﬁcantly reduced the sensitivity of H1299 cells to
BXI-61 and BXI-72 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These ﬁndings
indicate that Bcl-XL may be a selective target for the effect of
BXI on growth inhibition.

amount of cellular protein content and is an established and
optimized assay for the toxicity screening of compounds on
adherent cells in a 96-well format. Results indicate that BXI-61
and BXI-72 are superior to ABT-737 in suppressing lung cancer
cell growth (Fig. 1C). BXI-72 showed the greatest potency based
on its low IC50 concentrations against the tested cell lines (i.e.,
H1299: 0.49  0.12 mmol/L; A549: 0.68  0.08 mmol/L; Table 1).
Because most lung cancer cell lines expressed higher levels of
Bcl-XL than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B; Fig. 1A), both BXI-61 and BXI-72 displayed relatively
selective cytotoxicity against lung cancer cells compared with
normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1). These ﬁndings suggest that BXIs may have potential
selectivity for tumor cells in vitro and/or in vivo.
To directly measure BXI/Bcl-XL binding, we used an in vitro
ﬂuorescence polarization assay with a ﬂuorescent Bak BH3
domain peptide (50 -FAM-GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR) and puriﬁed
Bcl-XL protein (25–27, 34). We found that BXIs directly bind to
Bcl-XL with high binding afﬁnity (BXI-61: Ki ¼ 14.8  1.54
nmol/L; BXI-72: Ki ¼ 0.9  0.15 nmol/L; Fig. 2). Importantly,
both BXI-61 and BXI-72 have very low binding afﬁnities with

predicted to target the BH3-binding pocket of Bcl-XL, BXIs may
disrupt the Bcl-XL/Bak heterodimerization leading to dissociation of Bak from the Bcl-XL/Bak complex and subsequent
Bak homo-oligomerization and activation. To test this hypothesis, H1299 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl-XL
and Bak were treated with increasing concentrations of BXI-72
(i.e., 0.1–5 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Co-immunoprecipitation
experiments were carried out using a Bcl-XL or Bak antibody,
respectively. Results indicated that treatment of cells with BXI72 resulted in a dose-dependent Bcl-XL/Bak dissociation (Fig.
3A). A recent report indicates that Bcl-XL can also interact with
Bax (37). Similarly, BXI-72 also disrupts Bcl-XL/Bax complexes
(Supplementary Fig. S3). BXI-72 itself does not affect Bak
expression in cells (Fig. 3A). To assess whether BXI-dissociated
Bak molecules form homo-oligomers in the mitochondrial
membrane, a cross-linking study using BMH was conducted
following treatment of cells with BXI-72 as described in Materials and Methods. Intriguingly, treatment of cells with BXI-72
facilitated the formation of Bak dimers, trimers, and multimers
(Fig. 3B). The molecular sizes of these oligomers obtained were
estimated to be multiples of about 28 kDa, suggesting the
formation of Bak homo-oligomers. It is known that formation
of Bak oligomers can result in cyt c release to induce apoptosis
(38, 39). Our results show that BXI-72-initiated Bak oligomerization can also facilitate cyt c release from mitochondria
(Fig. 3C).

dose level with increasing doses of BXI-72 (10–50 mg/kg/d)
intraperitoneally for up to 25 days. The 50 mg/kg/d dose
was uniformly lethal in the 6 mice within 10 days, whereas
65% of mice treated at the 40 mg/kg/d dose died within 25
days. The dose range between 10 and 30 mg/kg/d was
tolerable with no death recorded after 25 days of daily
administration (Fig. 4A). We therefore determined the MTD
of BXI-72 (i.p.) with 25-day treatment to be approximately
30 to 40mg/kg/d.
To test whether BXI is active in vivo, we tested the anti–lung
cancer efﬁcacy of BXI-72 in lung tumor xenografts as described
(18). Results indicate that treatment with BXI-72 resulted in a
dose-dependent regression of established lung cancer xenografts (Fig. 4B). To assess whether BXI-72 induced tumor
growth regression via apoptosis in vivo, representative samples
from harvested tumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for active caspase-3 as described (18).
A dose-dependent apoptosis was observed in tumor tissues
after BXI-72 treatment (Fig. 4C). Importantly, doses of 20 to
30mg/kg not only potently suppressed tumor growth but also
were well-tolerated without weight loss (Figs. 4 and 5A).
However, treatment of mice with increased concentrations of
BXI-72 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of platelets.
There were no signiﬁcant increases in ALT, AST, and BUN or
decreases in WBCs and RBCs (Fig. 5B). Histopathology of
harvested normal tissues (heart, liver, lung, brain, spleen,
kidney, intestine, etc.) revealed no evidence of normal tissue
toxicities after treatment with doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg/d (Fig.
5C). However, treatment of mice with doses of 40 to 50 mg/kg/d
for 2 weeks resulted in increases in ALT, AST and BUN,
indicating renal and hepatic toxicities at these higher doses

(Fig. 5B). Elevated liver function test was associated with
hepatocellular necrosis in mice treated with 50 mg of BXI-72
(Fig. 5C). These ﬁndings suggest that doses between 20 and 30
mg/kg provide the optimal therapeutic index for BXI-72 for in
vivo experimentation involving lung cancer xenografts. In addition, BXI-61 at dose of 40 mg/kg/d also exhibited high potency
against lung cancer without signiﬁcant normal tissue toxicities
except for a slight decrease in platelets (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To compare the antitumor efﬁcacy between BXI-72, BXI-61,
and ABT-737 in vivo, mice with H1299 lung cancer xenografts
were treated with same dose (i.e., 30 mg/kg/d) of BXI-61, BXI72, or ABT-737 i.p. for 14 days. Results show that BXI-72 and
BXI-61 have more potent efﬁcacy against human lung cancer
than ABT-737 without weight loss (Fig. 6A and B). Although 3
compounds caused various degrees of platelet reduction, BXI61 and BXI-72 had less effect on platelet than ABT-737 (Fig. 6C).

BXI overcomes acquired IR resistance both in vitro and
in vivo
To determine whether Bcl2 or Bcl-XL contributes to
acquired resistance to radiation, we established an A549 cell
line with acquired resistance to ionizing radiation (i.e., A549IRR) as described (30). Increased levels of Bcl-XL and Bcl2 were
observed in A549-IRR cells as compared with A549-P cells (Fig.
7A). Similar ﬁndings were also observed in other lung cancer
cells (i.e. H157-P/H157-IRR and H358-P/H358-IRR; Supplementary Fig. S5). Importantly, parental A549 (A549-P) cells
remained sensitive but A549-IRR became insensitive to IR (Fig.
7B and C). These results provide strong evidence that IRenhanced Bcl-XL contributes to acquired radioresistance.
Intriguingly, both A549-P and A549-IRR cells remained sensitive to BXI-61 and BXI-72 (Fig. 7B and C), suggesting that BXIs
are able to overcome acquired radioresistance through their

suppression of Bcl-XL. To further test whether BXI overcomes
radioresistance in vivo, NSCLC xenografts derived from A549-P
and A549-IRR cell lines were treated with IR (2 Gy 5) or BXI-72
(20 mg/kg/d 18) alone or in combination as indicated. We
observed that lung cancer xenografts derived from A549-IRR
cells were resistant to IR treatment, whereas xenografts
derived from A549-P were sensitive to IR treatment (Fig.
7D). Consistent with the in vitro observation, BXI-72 repressed
tumors derived from both A549-P and A549-IRR cells, indicating that BXI-72 can overcome acquired radioresistance in vivo.
Other than a slight decrease in WBC or PLT count in IR- or BXI72–treated mice, there were no signiﬁcant normal tissue
toxicities (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Discussion
Mimicking the BH3 domain to kill cancers is a strategy that
is presently being explored in the development of Bcl2 inhibitors as anticancer drugs (40, 41). By binding to the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl2/Bcl-XL, the BH3 mimetics function as
competitive inhibitors (18, 40). Three small-molecule Bcl2
inhibitors, including gossypol (AT-101), obatoclax (GX15070), and ABT-263, are in clinical trials (phase III; refs. 40,
41). Gossypol and obatoclax are BH3 mimetics that act as panBcl2 inhibitors (12, 41). However, gossypol and obatoclax are
not entirely dependent on Bax and Bak for apoptosis induction
and toxicity to normal cells (40, 42). In contrast, the Bad BH3
mimetic ABT-737 was ineffective in inducing apoptosis in cells

doubly deﬁcient in Bax and Bak, indicating that its mechanism
of action may be predominantly through the Bcl2 family
(40, 43). ABT-737 selectively binds to Bcl2, Bcl-XL, and BclW but not Mcl-1 and Bﬂ-1/A1 (18). However, ABT-737 resistance can be caused by expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL (17, 43–
45). Here, we chose the BH3 domain of Bcl-XL (aa 90–98) as a
docking site for screening of small molecules that may inactivate Bcl-XL using the UCSF DOCK program 6.1 and a database of small molecules from the NCI. We found 2 new Bcl-XL
inhibitors (BXI-61 and BXI-72) that preferentially bind to BclXL with inhibitory constant (Ki) values at nanomolar levels
(Fig. 2). These 2 compounds exhibited signiﬁcantly lower
binding afﬁnity for Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Bﬂ-1/A1 (Fig. 2),

indicating a more selective binding to Bcl-XL. This is especially
important because Bcl-XL is more widely expressed in NSCLC
and SCLC cells than Bcl-2 (Fig. 1A; refs. 8, 22). A relatively high
dose of ABT-737 (i.e., Bcl-2 inhibitor) is required to effectively
inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells expressing low levels of
endogenous Bcl-2 and high levels of endogenous Bcl-XL (17,
18, 21, 22). In contrast, our new Bcl-XL inhibitors (i.e., BXI-61
and BXI-72) showed superior efﬁcacy to ABT-737 against lung
cancer cells that express high levels of endogenous Bcl-XL (Fig.
1). Consistent with our discovery approach, BXI repression of
lung cancer growth occurs in a Bcl-XL–dependent manner as
depletion of Bcl-XL signiﬁcantly reduces sensitivity of lung
cancer cells to BXI (Supplementary Fig. S2). Importantly, BXI-

72, which showed a stronger Bcl-XL binding afﬁnity (Ki ! 0.9 
0.15 nmol/L), also displayed greater cytotoxicity against
human lung cancer cells than BXI-61 (Ki !14.8  1.54
nmol/L; Fig. 1C). This thus suggests that the anticancer potency of this new class of agents may be dependent on their BclXL–binding afﬁnity.
Although silencing of Bcl-XL could cause some H1299 cells
undergoing apoptosis due to disruption of Bcl-XL/Bak heterodimerization, certain populations of cells may still be alive via a
compensatory mechanism (i.e., formation of Bak/Mcl-1 complex) during long-term stable selection because H1299 cells
also express high levels of endogenous Mcl-1 protein (46). Thus,
there are no or less Bcl-XL molecules in such type of survived
cells for BXI targeting. This not only helps explain why the
stable Bcl-XL silenced and survived cells were insensitive to
BXI treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2) but also suggests that
Bcl-XL is a selective target for BXI in cells.

A distinctive feature of Bcl-2 family proteins is that they
interact with one another to form heterodimers or homodimers through the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (35). Antiapoptotic Bcl-XL preferentially interacts with Bak and forms a
heterodimer that inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of Bak
(35). Bak is thought to drive apoptosis by forming homooligomers that permeabilize mitochondria (29). This homooligomerization of Bak is essential for activation of its proapoptotic function. Oligomerization involves insertion of the
BH3 domain of one Bak molecule into the groove of another
and may produce symmetrical Bak dimers. Our results reveal
that treatment of lung cancer cells with BXI-72 resulted not
only in dissociation of Bak/Bcl-XL or Bax/Bcl-XL complexes
but also in Bak oligomerization and cyt c release (Fig. 3),
suggesting that the binding of BXI with Bcl-XL could disrupt
Bcl-XL/Bak heterodimers and subsequently facilitate Bak
activation via its homo-oligomerization. This may be a key

mechanism by which BXI activates apoptosis leading to cell
death and tumor regression in vitro and in vivo, respectively.
The antitumor activity of BXI in vivo was evaluated in lung
cancer xenografts. Both BXI-61 and BXI-72 potently repressed
lung cancer in animal models (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig.
S4). We determined the MTD of BXI-72 with a 25-day treatment
to be between 30 and 40 mg/kg/d (Fig. 4A). Dose–response
experiments indicated that doses of BXI-72 between 20 and 30
mg/kg/d potently repress lung cancer in vivo with a slight
decrease in platelet count but no other normal tissue toxicity
(Figs. 4 and 5), indicating that these doses should be effective
and safe for further characterization of this compound in
murine lung cancer models. As a dose-dependent increase of
apoptosis in tumor tissues was observed in the BXI treatment
group, this suggests that repression of lung cancer by BXI
occurs through induction of apoptosis in tumors (Fig. 4C).
Recent reports indicate that, in addition to antitumor activity, ABT-737 and ABT-263 can induce thrombocytopenia (47–
49). Our ﬁndings here show that 2 BXI compounds have more
potent efﬁcacy than ABT-737 against lung cancer but less effect
on platelet reduction in vivo (Fig. 6). It is known that ABT-737
or ABT-263 not only inhibits Bcl-XL but also inhibits Bcl2 and
Bcl-w (18), suggesting that ABT-737 or ABT-263 is not a speciﬁc
Bcl-XL inhibitor, which is a pan-inhibitor for Bcl2, Bcl-XL, and
Bcl-w. This could render ABT-737 or ABT-263 more toxicity to
normal cells such as platelets. In contrast, BXI-61 or BXI-72
only speciﬁcally binds Bcl-XL but not Bcl2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and
Bﬂ-1A1 (Fig. 2), indicating that BXI but not ABT-737 is more
speciﬁc Bcl-XL inhibitor. Thus, BXI may have better chance to
let platelet survival because Bcl2 and Bcl-w could be functional
after BXI treatment in platelets. This may help explain why
BXIs have less effect on platelet reduction than ABT-737 or
ABT-263. Because thrombocytopenia is a major problem in
cancer therapy, BXI compounds may have advantage and be
more valuable in clinic use as compared with ABT-737 or ABT263.
Radiotherapy is a major therapeutic intervention for
patients with lung cancer and is administered to up to 75%
of patients with lung cancer during the course of their disease
(50). A major challenge affecting outcomes of patients with
lung cancer is the development of acquired radioresistance. To
test whether BXI could overcome radioresistance of lung
cancer, we established acquired radiation-resistant lung cancer cell model systems (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. S5).
Elevated levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl2
but not Mcl-1were observed in ionizing radiation resistant cells
(i.e., A549-IRR vs. A549-P, H157-IRR vs. H157-P, H358-IRR vs.
H358-P; Figs. 7A and S5), suggesting that this upregulation
could, at least in part, contribute to radioresistance. Intriguingly, the BXI lead compound not only reversed radiation
resistance in vitro but also overcame radiation resistance in

vivo at a relatively low dose (i.e., 20 mg/kg/d), leading to the
effective suppression of lung cancer xenografts that were
resistant to radiation (Fig. 7). Mice tolerated the combination
treatment with BXI and IR well without signiﬁcant normal
tissue toxicities except for a reversible decrease in white blood
cells that resulted from radiotherapy or a tolerated decrease in
platelets that resulted from BXI (Supplementary Fig. S6).
In summary, we have discovered new Bcl-XL inhibitors (BXI61 and BXI-72) that speciﬁcally bind the BH3 domain pocket of
Bcl-XL, disrupt Bcl-XL/Bak or Bcl-XL/Bax heterodimerization,
and facilitate Bak homo-oligomerization leading to Bak activation and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. These lead compounds have potent activities against lung cancer in vitro and
in vivo and potentially offer superior efﬁcacy over the BH3
mimetic ABT-737 or ABT-263 in lung cancer therapy. The
increased levels of Bcl-XL in lung cancer cells with acquired
radioresistance make Bcl-XL an ideal target for overcoming
radioresistance. As our ﬁndings show that BXI can overcome
acquired radioresistance of lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, a
combination of BXI with IR may represent an effective new
strategy for the treatment of lung cancer, including those
patients who are resistant to radiotherapy, leading to longterm tumor-free survival.
