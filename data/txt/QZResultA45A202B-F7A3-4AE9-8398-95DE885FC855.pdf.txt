Abstract
The indole-3-carbinol (I3C) metabolite 3,3¶-diindolylmethane
(DIM) is a proposed cancer prevention agent for various
tumor types, including breast cancer. Here, we show that DIM
up-regulates expression of the tumor suppressor protein
BRCA1 in carcinoma and normal cell types. Up-regulation of
BRCA1 was dose and time dependent, and it was observed at
physiologically relevant micromolar and submicromolar DIM
concentrations when cells were exposed for 72 hours. Treatment with the parent compound (I3C) or DIM (1 Mmol/L)
protected against cell killing due to H2O2 and other oxidants,
and the protection was abrogated by knockdown of BRCA1.
DIM stimulated signaling by the antioxidant transcription
factor NFE2L2 (NRF2) through the antioxidant response
element in a BRCA1-dependent manner. We further showed
that DIM rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of BRCA1 on
Ser 1387 and Ser 1524 and that these phosphorylations are required for protection against oxidative stress. DIM-induced
phosphorylation of BRCA1 on Ser 1387 was dependent on ataxiatelangiectasia mutated. Finally, in our assay systems, H2O2induced cell death was not due to apoptosis. However, a
significant component of cell death was attributable to
autophagy, and both DIM and BRCA1 inhibited H2O2-induced
autophagy. Our findings suggest that low concentrations of
DIM protect cells against oxidative stress via the tumor
suppressor BRCA1 by several distinct mechanisms. [Cancer

invasion, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation and induce apoptosis
by modulating signaling pathways involving Akt, nuclear factor-nB,
and FOXO3 (9–12). It can also modulate basal and estrogeninducible gene expression (13, 14), and it can induce an
endoplasmic reticulum stress response (15). Like I3C, DIM can
regulate estrogen metabolism by shifting the metabolism from
potentially carcinogenic 16a-hydroxy derivatives to inert 2-hydroxy
derivatives (16). DIM is also an androgen receptor antagonist in
prostate cancer cells (17). Previous studies suggest that I3C and
DIM can function as ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (18,
19) and can inhibit estrogen receptor activity independently of any
effect on estrogen metabolism (20).
There is limited available information on plasma levels of DIM
that can be achieved through oral ingestion of I3C or DIM. In
humans, after single oral doses of I3C of 400 to 1200 mg, the peak
plasma concentrations (observed after 2–3 hours) ranged from
61 to 607 ng/mL of DIM (about 0.25–2.5 Amol/L; ref. 8). Oral
administration of DIM might yield higher plasma DIM levels
because oral I3C is converted to various acid condensation
products in the stomach (21). The percent conversion of I3C to
its hydrolysis products and absorption is unclear, but in the study
cited, no I3C was detected in plasma.
Previously, we reported that I3C up-regulates expression of
the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 due, in
part, to an endoplasmic reticulum stress response (22). Here, we
report that DIM stimulates BRCA1 signaling and expression at
low concentrations and protects cells against oxidative stress in a
BRCA1-dependent manner.

Introduction
Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical from cruciferous
vegetables, is of interest because a diet rich in cruciferous
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of several tumor
types, such as breast cancer (1, 2), and because dietary
supplementation with I3C can prevent estrogen-dependent cancers
(breast, cervix, and endometrium) in animals (3– 5). In the acid
environment of the stomach, I3C undergoes hydrolysis to a number
of products, including a dimeric product, 3,3¶-diindolylmethane
(DIM), its major active metabolite (6). DIM is acid stable and is
detected in the bloodstream after oral intake of I3C or DIM (7, 8).
Most studies on DIM have used supraphysiologic concentrations
(15–50 Amol/L). These studies indicate that DIM can inhibit

Materials and Methods
Cells and Culture
All cell lines, except normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
and Brca1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. MEFs homozygous for a
deletion of Brca1 exon 11 and wild-type MEFs were generously provided by
Dr. Chuxia Deng (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, Bethesda, MD; ref. 23). All cell types, except HMECs, were cultured
using standard techniques (22, 24). HMECs were obtained from Clonetics
and grown in a defined medium containing mammary epithelial cell basal
medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories) supplemented with 4 Ag/mL
bovine pituitary extract (BD Biosciences), 5 Ag/mL insulin, 10 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (Sigma Chemical Co.), 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma), and 10 5 mol/L isoproterenol (Sigma).

Reagents
I3C was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in DMSO before dilution in
cell culture medium. A bioavailable formulation of DIM (BR-DIM) was
generously provided by Dr. Michael Zeligs (Bioresponse, Boulder, CO). It
is herein referred to as ‘‘DIM.’’ DIM was also dissolved in DMSO. H2O2,

expression. A, subconfluent proliferating cells
were incubated with 10 Amol/L DIM (or DMSO)
for 24 h and Western blotted for BRCA1 and
a-actin (loading control). B to D, cells were
treated with DIM for the indicated times using the
indicated concentrations and harvested for
Western blotting for BRCA1, BRCA2, and a-actin.

paraquat, nickel acetate, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma.

Expression Vectors
The wild-type BRCA1 vector (wtBRCA1) was described earlier (24).
Expression vectors encoding full-length BRCA1 with point mutations at
different serine residues (S1387A, S1423A, S1457A, and S1524A) were
created by site-directed mutagenesis of wtBRCA1 within the pcDNA3 vector
(Invitrogen) using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A human beclin
1 cDNA (provided by Dr. G. Kroemer, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif,
France) and a human NFE2L2/NRF2 cDNA (Invitrogen) were inserted into
the pcDNA3 vector. The green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3)
vector was provided by Dr. Gabriel Lopez-Berestein (Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, New York, NY; ref. 25).

Transient Transfections
Subconfluent proliferating cells were transfected overnight with the
indicated vector (15 Ag DNA/100-mm dish or 5 Ag/well in six-well dishes)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), washed, and allowed to recover for
several hours. The cells were then harvested using trypsin, seeded into 48or 96-well dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and subjected to the
indicated treatments before MTT assays.

Small Interfering RNA Treatments
Proliferating cells in 12-well dishes were treated with gene-specific small
interfering RNA (siRNA) or control-siRNA using siRNA Transfection
Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). BRCA1-siRNA, ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated (ATM)-siRNA, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)-siRNA, beclin 1-siRNA,
and control-siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cells
were exposed to the indicated siRNA (50 nmol/L) for at least 48 h. For
experiments lasting >72 h, the cells were refed with fresh siRNA of the same
type (50 nmol/L) on the 3rd day. The efficacy of the knockdown was
confirmed by Western blotting.

Reporter Assays
The NQO1-ARE-Luc reporter contains the antioxidant response element
(ARE) of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) driving a minimal
promoter upstream of luciferase (26). GST-a1-Luc contains the luciferase
gene under the control of a promoter segment containing 940 bp upstream
of the transcription start site of mouse GST-a1. x-CT-Luc contains the
luciferase gene under the control of a 235-bp segment upstream of the
transcription start site of mouse cystine/glutamate transporter. These

reporters were generously provided by Dr. Filiberto Cimino (Universita di
Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy; ref. 27). Reporter assays were performed as
described earlier (22, 24). Briefly, cells in 48-well dishes were transfected
overnight with the indicated expression vector(s) (0.25 Ag/well) and reporter
(0.25 Ag/well) using Lipofectamine 2000. They were then washed, allowed to
recover for several hours, treated as indicated, and harvested for luciferase
measurements. Luciferase values were normalized to the control conditions
and expressed as mean F SE of quadruplicate wells. Transfection efficiency
was monitored using the Galacto-Star Mammalian Reporter Gene Assay
System (Applied Biosystems). Each experiment was performed at least twice
to assure that the findings were reproducible.

Treatment with Oxidants
Subconfluent proliferating cells in 48- or 96-well dishes were treated with
different doses of H2O2, paraquat, or nickel acetate for 24 h (unless
otherwise stated) in the presence of DIM or vehicle (DMSO) and assayed for
MTT dye reduction, a measure of mitochondrial viability (28).

MTT Assays
After the indicated treatment, cells in 48- or 96-well dishes were tested
for MTT dye conversion. Cell viability was calculated as the amount of dye
conversion relative to sham-treated control cells and expressed as mean
F SE of 10 replicate wells. At least two independent experiments were
performed to assure reproducibility of the findings.

Autophagy Assays
Monodansylcadaverine staining. Autophagic vacuoles were detected
based on monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining (29). After the indicated
treatments, cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with
0.05 mmol/L MDC for 60 min at 37jC, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(15 min), and washed twice with PBS. The glass coverslips were mounted
onto slides using Geltol as mounting medium. Quantitative determination
of MDC-positive cells was performed immediately after preparation using
a Nikon Mikrophot-FXA with a 356-nm excitation filter and a 545-nm
barrier filter. Cells were manually scored as positive if they contained
significant staining for autophagic vacuoles compared with the large
majority of untreated control cells. The percentage of MDC-positive cells
was determined by counting of 1,000 cells per culture and plotted as
mean F SE based on three experiments.

Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as described earlier (22, 24). Briefly,
aliquots of whole-cell lysate (100 Ag protein) were separated using a 12%

SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane, which was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4jC
followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:2,000. Protein bands were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham). The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-BRCA1
(1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-BRCA2 (1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal a-actin (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti–phospho-BRCA1 (S1387; 1:1,000; Millipore), anti–
phospho-BRCA1 (S1423; 1:500; Millipore), anti–phospho-BRCA1 (S1457;
1:500; Millipore), anti–phospho-BRCA1 (S1524; 1:500; Cell Signaling
Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-ATM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
rabbit polyclonal anti-ATR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal
anti–beclin 1 (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:200; Novus
Biologicals). Equal protein loading was confirmed by immunoblotting for
a-actin. Colored markers (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular size standards.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as described before (22, 24).
The cycle number was adjusted so that all reactions fell into the linear
range of amplification. The forward and reverse primers (product
sizes) were as follows: BRCA1, 5¶-TTGCGGGAGGAAAATGGGTAGTTA-3¶
and 3¶-TGTGCCAAGGGTGAATGATGAAG-5¶ (285 bp); MGST1, 5¶ACTGCGCTGGCTTTGGCAAG-3¶ and 3¶-AGATCCGAGCACCTACAAAG-5¶
(200 bp); h-actin, 5¶-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGATA-3¶ and 3¶-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGATA-5¶ (764 bp); and h2-macroglobulin, 5¶CTCGCCTACTCTCTCTTTCT-3¶ and 5¶-TGTCGGATGGATGAAACCCAG-3¶
(136 bp).

Cell Cycle Analysis
Cells were harvested using trypsin, washed with PBS, and fixed in cold
70% ethanol. The samples were then treated with RNase A, stained with
propidium iodide (100 mg/mL), and analyzed by FACSort (Becton
Dickinson) using the ModFit software (Verity Software House). At least
20,000 events were collected and analyzed.

Statistical Methods
Where appropriate, comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s
t tests.

Results
DIM stimulates BRCA1 expression. We found that DIM
(10 Amol/L  24 hours) stimulated BRCA1 protein expression in
various carcinoma cell types, including prostate (DU-145) and
breast (BT549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231; Fig. 1A). Similar results
were observed in two additional breast cancer cell lines (BT474 and
MDA-MB-453), a lung cancer cell line (A549), and a cervical cancer
cell line (HeLa; Supplementary Fig. S1A). It seemed that cell lines
with low BRCA1 expression exhibited more stimulation than those
with high basal expression. In DU-145 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
stimulation of BRCA1 protein expression was dose dependent
(24-hour exposure) and time dependent (10 Amol/L DIM;
Supplementary Fig. S1B–E). At 10 Amol/L DIM, increased BRCA1
protein levels were first observed after 8 hours. Densitometry
corresponding to these Western blots is provided in Supplementary
Fig. S2.
In MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to a low dose of DIM (1 Amol/L),
BRCA1 (and BRCA2) protein levels continued to increase for 4 days
(Fig. 1B), and in cells exposed to DIM for 72 hours, increased
BRCA1/2 levels were detected at V0.5 Amol/L DIM (Fig. 1C). Other
breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468) also
showed increases in BRCA1 protein after a 72-hour exposure to
1 Amol/L DIM (Fig. 1D). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DIM for
72 hours showed dose-dependent increases in BRCA1 mRNA at
z0.5 Amol/L DIM (Supplementary Fig. S1F). These findings suggest
that low, physiologically relevant concentrations of DIM stimulate
BRCA1 expression.

I3C and DIM protect breast cancer cells against oxidative
stress. MCF-7 and T47D cells were incubated with I3C (25 Amol/L)
or vehicle (DMSO) plus H2O2 for 24 hours and tested for cell
viability using MTT assays. Without H2O2, 25 Amol/L I3C has no
effect on cell viability using MTT assays (22). I3C enhanced the
survival of MCF-7 and T47D cells at all but the lowest dose of
H2O2 (P < 0.001–0.01; Fig. 2A and B). To test the role of BRCA1 in
I3C cell protection, cells were pretreated with BRCA1-siRNA or
control-siRNA for 48 hours before incubation with I3C/H2O2.
BRCA1-siRNA (but not control-siRNA) abrogated I3C-mediated cell
protection (P < 0.01). We next tested the effect of DIM (1 Amol/L)
on sensitivity to H2O2. Like I3C, DIM protected both cell lines
against H2O2 (P < 0.001–0.01), and BRCA1-siRNA (but not controlsiRNA) abrogated DIM-mediated cell protection (P < 0.01; Fig. 2C
and D). The efficacy of BRCA1 knockdowns is illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. S3.
DIM also protected DU-145 cells against H2O2, and it protected
MDA-MB-231 cells against nickel acetate, an agent whose toxicity
is mostly due to oxidative stress (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B;
ref. 30). DIM protected MDA-MB-231 cells against paraquat, a
herbicide that causes toxicity via generation of superoxide ions
(Supplementary Fig. S4C and D; ref. 31), and it protected MDA-MB231 cells against H2O2 in a BRCA1-dependent manner (P < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. S4E).
DIM stimulates ARE-dependent signaling. In response to
oxidative stress, the transcription factor NFE2L2 (NRF2) dissociates
from its cytoplasmic inhibitor, translocates to the nucleus, and
activates transcription of genes containing an ARE in their
promoters (32). We used a luciferase reporter driven by the
NQO1-ARE (26) to determine if DIM regulates antioxidant
signaling. Because DIM stimulates BRCA1 expression in a timedependent manner, we tested exposure times from 24 to 96 hours.
DIM (1 Amol/L) stimulated NQO1-ARE-Luc activity in MDA-MB-

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

231 at all time points (P < 0.01; Fig. 3A). The fold stimulation
relative to cells incubated without DIM was f3-fold at 72 to
96 hours in this experiment, although it was up to 7-fold in other
experiments. In cells cotransfected with an NRF2 expression vector,
NRF2 stimulated NQO1-ARE-Luc by 10-fold, and DIM enhanced
NRF2-stimulated reporter activity by another 4-fold (P < 0.001;
Fig. 3B).
We tested the role of BRCA1 in DIM-stimulated NRF2 activity by
pretreating MDA-MB-231 cells with BRCA1-siRNA and determining
the effect of DIM (1 Amol/L  72 hours) on NRF2-stimulated
NQO1-ARE-Luc activity. BRCA1-siRNA (but not control-siRNA)
inhibited NQO1-ARE-Luc activity due to NRF2 alone (P < 0.001)
and reduced the DIM + NRF2–stimulated reporter to less than that
of NRF2 alone (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C). BRCA1-siRNA also reduced the
basal reporter activity and blocked the DIM-stimulated activity (P <
0.001; Fig. 3D).
We tested the ability of DIM to stimulate two additional AREcontaining reporters: GST-a1-Luc and x-CT-Luc (27). NRF2
stimulated GST-a1-Luc activity by about 6- to 7.5-fold in MDAMB-231 and T47D cells, and DIM (1 Amol/L) gave an additional
5-fold stimulation (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S5A). The DIM
stimulation of NRF2 activity was abrogated by BRCA1-siRNA (P <
0.001). The ability of NRF2 to stimulate GST-a1-Luc activity without
DIM was also attenuated by BRCA1-siRNA (P < 0.001). Similar
results were obtained using the c-CT-Luc reporter, and DIM caused
dose-dependent increases in the mRNA for MGST1, another AREregulated gene (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C; ref. 33), suggesting
that DIM stimulates ARE signaling in a BRCA1-dependent manner.
To further examine the role of endogenous BRCA1 in NRF2
signaling, we tested wild-type (Brca1+/+) versus Brca1-deficient
(Brca1 / ) MEFs (23). In wild-type cells, NRF2 and DIM (1 Amol/L 
72 hours) robustly stimulated NQO1-ARE-Luc activity, and the
combination of DIM + NRF2 gave much greater stimulation than

either agent alone (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S5D). In contrast,
Brca1 / cells showed no DIM-induced stimulation of reporter
activity, and the stimulation by NRF2 was less than that observed in
Brca1+/+ cells.
DIM stimulates BRCA1 signaling. Although DIM (1 Amol/L)
may take >24 hours to increase BRCA1 protein levels, a 24-hour
exposure conferred BRCA1-dependent protection against H2O2,
suggesting that some DIM effects occur before BRCA1 levels
increase. We tested the effect of DIM on BRCA1 phosphorylation by
Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies in MDA-MB231 and T47D cells. A 30-minute exposure to DIM caused increased
phosphorylation of BRCA1 on S1387 and S1524 but not on S1423 or
S1457 (Fig. 4A and B). The DIM-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1
on S1387 was time dependent (Fig. 4C and D), with high levels of
phosphorylation observed at short times (10–20 minutes) and
reduction in phosphorylation from 2 to 24 hours. ATM and ATR are
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family proteins that phosphorylate
BRCA1 and other substrates in response to DNA damage (see
Discussion). We tested the effect of knocking down these proteins
on phospho-BRCA1 (S1387) levels. ATM-siRNA had little effect on
basal phosphorylation but blocked DIM-induced phosphorylation
in MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells (Supplementary Fig. S6), whereas
ATR-siRNA had no effect on DIM-induced phosphorylation (data
not shown).
We tested the significance of these findings using a cell line with
no detectable endogenous BRCA1 (U87MG glioma cells). The cells
were transfected with wtBRCA1 or expression vectors for BRCA1
proteins with alanine mutations of different serine residues and
tested for sensitivity to H2O2 (50 nmol/L for 24 hours) F DIM.
Expression of the mutant BRCA1 proteins was confirmed by
Western blotting. Consistent with the absence of endogenous
BRCA1, DIM did not significantly protect untransfected cells or

cells transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector. wtBRCA1 alone
conferred significant protection, as did the BRCA1 mutants S1423A
and S1457A (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). However, S1387A and S1524A
conferred little or no protection. DIM conferred additional
protection of cells transfected with wtBRCA1, S1423A, S1457A,
and S1524A but little protection of cells transfected with S1387A.
These findings suggest that DIM-induced phosphorylation of S1387
and, to some extent, S1524A contributes to cell protection.
DIM does not protect BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells
against H2O2. We similarly studied HCC1937, a breast cancer cell
line homozygous for mutant BRCA1 (5382insC; ref. 34). DIM failed
to protect HCC1937 cells against H2O2, but wtBRCA1 conferred
significant protection (P < 0.001; Fig. 5B). Here, DIM + wtBRCA1
did not confer additional protection beyond that of wtBRCA1
alone. The S1387A and S1524A mutations abrogated BRCA1
protection against H2O2, whereas the S1423A and S1457A mutants
retained full protection activity (P < 0.001). These results are
similar to those obtained in U87MG, except that none of the BRCA1
proteins allowed additional protection by DIM. Explanations for
this difference between U87MG and HCC1937 are considered in
Discussion.
DIM stimulates BRCA1 signaling and expression in normal
mammary epithelial cells. We tested the effects of DIM on
normal HMECs and MCF-10A, an immortal line of nontumor
HMECs (35). DIM caused phosphorylation of BRCA1 on S1387, with
a peak effect by 20 minutes (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Over
the time period studied (0–4 hours), total BRCA1 protein levels
were unchanged. At longer times, DIM caused increases in total
BRCA1 protein levels that first occurred at 8 to 16 hours and
continued over 24 to 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S7C and D).
Finally, DIM protected both cell types against H2O2 (P < 0.01;
Supplementary Fig. S7E and F).

signaling. A to D, cells were treated with
DIM (1 Amol/L) for the indicated time and
harvested to detect total or phosphorylated
BRCA1 by Western blotting.

DIM blocks autophagy caused by H2O2. Based on flow
cytometric detection of cells with sub-G 1 DNA content, H2O2
caused little or no apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 or T47D cells at a
dose that should kill a large majority of cells (200 nmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S8). As a positive control, the DNA-damaging
agent Adriamycin yielded a large peak of cells with apoptotic
sub-G1 DNA content. We quantified the autophagy rate by staining
the cells with MDC, a dye that stains autophagic vacuoles. MDAMB-231 cells were treated with H2O2 (100 nmol/L) F DIM for
24 hours and assayed for the presence of MDC-positive autophagic
vacuoles. H2O2 caused an increase in the percentage of cells
exhibiting autophagy, from <2% to f50%, and most of this increase
was blocked by DIM (P < 0.001; Fig. 6A). H2O2 also caused
conversion of a portion of the cytoplasmic LC3 (LC3-I) to
membrane-associated LC3 (LC3-II; Fig. 6B), a marker of autophagy
(36). The H2O2-induced conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II was

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

reduced by DIM treatment. wtBRCA1 also inhibited H2O2-induced
autophagy (P < 0.001; Fig. 6C) and attenuated the conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 6D). Photomicrographs of MDC-stained cells
corresponding to Fig. 6A and C are provided in Supplementary
Figs. S9 and S10. We measured autophagy by a second method in
which MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a GFP-LC3
expression vector and examined for formation of puncta (autophagosomes; ref. 37). These assays gave results similar to those in
Fig. 6A and C (data not shown).
To further test the contribution of autophagy to H2O2-mediated
cell killing, we knocked down or overexpressed the essential
autophagy gene beclin 1. In MDA-MB-231 cells, beclin 1-siRNA
increased cell survival by z2-fold at each dose of H2O2 (P < 0.001),
whereas a wt-beclin 1 expression vector reduced cell survival
(Supplementary Fig. S11A), suggesting that autophagy contributed
to H2O2-induced cell death in our assays. Finally, we showed that

DIM Protects against Oxidative Stress

DIM causes dose-dependent inhibition of beclin 1 expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S11B). wtBRCA1 similarly
inhibited beclin 1 expression and blocked the H2O2-induced
stimulation of beclin 1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S11C).
DIM also inhibited beclin 1 expression in T47D cells (Supplementary
Fig. S11D), and wtBRCA1 blocked the H2O2-induced increase in
beclin 1 protein (Supplementary Fig. S11E). Densitometry showing
the effect of DIM and wtBRCA1 on beclin 1 levels is provided in
Supplementary Fig. S12. Thus, DIM and BRCA1 may render cells
resistant to autophagy, in part, through beclin 1.

Discussion
We showed that low doses of DIM (1 Amol/L) stimulate BRCA1
expression and protect cells against oxidative stress, in part,
through BRCA1. Protection against oxidative stress by DIM (and
I3C) is consistent with the previous finding that BRCA1 protects
against oxidative stress (24). The BRCA1 protection was attributed,
in part, to stimulation of an antioxidant response via NRF2, a
redox-sensitive transcription factor that stimulates expression of
phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant genes through the
ARE (32, 38). We identified several mechanisms by which DIM
protects against oxidative stress, including the BRCA1-dependent
stimulation of NRF2 activity. DIM stimulated several NRF2regulated promoters, including NQO1 (an oxidoreductase), GSTa1 (a glutathione S-transferase), and x-CT (cystine/glutamate
transporter). NRF2 seems to be a target for some dietary agents
proposed for cancer prevention (38), although this was not shown
previously for DIM or I3C.
Interestingly, DIM stimulated BRCA1 phosphorylation on S1387
and S1524 before any increase in BRCA1 protein levels. DIMinduced phosphorylation of S1387 was observed after 10 minutes
and showed a time course suggestive of a signaling event. In cell
lines lacking functional BRCA1, S1387 and S1524 were required for

protection against oxidative stress by exogenous BRCA1. Although
the significance of these phosphorylations is not clear, prior studies
suggest that these sites are phosphorylated by ATM and/or ATR in
response to ionizing or UV radiation (39, 40). ATM was required for
DIM-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 on S1387, suggesting that
DIM signals through ATM.
In U87MG cells (which do not express BRCA1), DIM conferred
additional protection against H2O2 beyond that afforded by
exogenous BRCA1, but BRCA1 with an S1387A mutation failed to
support DIM-mediated protection. In contrast, HCC1937 cells,
which express mutant BRCA1, showed no additional protection
from DIM beyond that due to exogenous BRCA1. It is possible that
the endogenous mutant BRCA1 interferes with the transfected
BRCA1 proteins, that the relevant phosphorylations cannot be
induced or enhanced by DIM in this cell type, or that the protection
by exogenous BRCA1 is already maximal and cannot increase
further.
Although the mechanism by which DIM induces BRCA1
phosphorylation is unclear, DIM and I3C can each activate an
endoplasmic reticulum stress response (unfolded protein response)
that is BRCA1 dependent, and this response is required for I3C
stimulation of BRCA1 expression (15, 22). We speculate that DIM
induces low-grade stress signaling that directly or indirectly leads
to rapid phosphorylation of BRCA1. One possibility is that DIM
interacts with one or more stress-responsive proteins and the
signal is transmitted to BRCA1. Although DIM and/or I3C can bind
to several proteins (e.g., aryl hydrocarbon receptor, estrogen
receptor, and androgen receptor; refs. 17–20), relatively little is
known about how DIM interacts with cell proteins or other
macromolecules.
Another interesting finding was that H2O2 caused little or no
apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, can cause
different combinations of autophagy, apoptosis, and/or necrosis in

a cell line–dependent and stimulus-dependent manner (41–43).
Autophagy is a process by which cells degrade macromolecules and
organelles that can lead to cell survival (e.g., under austere
conditions in tumors) or cell death in different contexts. In our
assays, H2O2-induced autophagy was cytotoxic and DIM/BRCA1
inhibition of autophagy was cytoprotective, as evidenced by the
following: (a) inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of beclin 1
(44) increased cell survival, (b) DIM and wtBRCA1 inhibited H2O2induced autophagy and at the same time protected cells against
cytotoxicity, and (c) we detected little or no H2O2-induced
apoptosis. Because the effects of oxidative stress are variable in
terms of autophagy versus apoptosis, we cannot say whether DIM/
BRCA1 inhibition of autophagy would be cytoprotective in a
different context (e.g., starvation rather than oxidative stress).
H2O2 caused a large increase in the percentage of cells
undergoing autophagy that was inhibited by DIM or wtBRCA1.
Consistent with this finding, H2O2 caused conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II, a marker of autophagy (36), and the conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II was attenuated by DIM or wtBRCA1. Consistent with the
idea that the protective effect of DIM is mediated by BRCA1,
wtBRCA1 blocked the H2O2-induced up-regulation of beclin 1.
These findings link DIM and BRCA1 to regulation of autophagy.
Low doses of DIM also stimulated BRCA1 signaling and
expression and protected against oxidative stress in normal or
nontumor-derived HMECs. These findings are important because
normal cell types are presumably the main target for cancer
prevention. Because we did not test whether H2O2 causes and DIM
blocks autophagy in these cell types, we cannot say whether the
observed protection reflects autophagy inhibition.
Our findings have implications for understanding chemoprevention and its limitations. Because the protective effects of DIM
occurred at physiologic concentrations, it is reasonable to
speculate that DIM blocks carcinogenesis, in part, by enabling
normal cells to mount a more effective antioxidant response. This

antioxidant response may include an increased ability of cells to
repair oxidative DNA damage because BRCA1 contributes to
various DNA repair processes (45). Tumor cells often exhibit
oxidative stress due to impaired antioxidant defenses. Thus, the
presence of preexisting cancer cells that are protected by
antioxidants is a possible explanation for the mixed results obtained
in clinical studies using antioxidants to prevent cancer (46–48).
Here, the ability of DIM to promote survival of oxidatively stressed
tumor cells could limit its activity as a chemoprevention agent.
Autophagy is regarded as a double-edged sword. On the one
hand, autophagy is a tumor suppressor mechanism that can serve
as a second type of programmed cell death replacing apoptosis. On
the other hand, it can be used as a survival mechanism by tumor
cells in nutrient limiting conditions (49). As noted above, we do
not know whether DIM inhibition of autophagy will extend to other
cell types and other causes of autophagy (e.g., starvation). Nor do
we know the extent to which autophagy inhibition by DIM is
the consequence of a reduced stimulus for autophagy due to an
increased cellular antioxidant response. Thus, at present, it is
difficult to assess the contribution of autophagy as a target for
DIM-mediated chemoprevention.
