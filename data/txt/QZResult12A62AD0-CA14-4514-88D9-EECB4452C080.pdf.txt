Importantly the clinically-approved and readilyused mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potentiated the protective
effects of Nutlin-3a in cells with WT p53. Moreover,
the anti-diabetic drug metformin would interact with
rapamycin in low glucose cell culture conditions to
protect cells with WT-p53 but not cells with mutant
p53. Metformin also inhibits the effects of mTOR and
reduces glucose and insulin levels [7, 8]. Previous studies
have indicated that many cancers are mTOR dependent
[9]. Indeed, mTOR hyperactivation may contribute to
cancer growth, obesity, diabetes as well as premature
aging. Many cancers are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors
[9-11]. In addition, these same mTOR inhibitors may
suppress premature aging and some are employed to
treat diabetes and prevent/suppress obesity (metformin).
Why are these observations presented by Apontes et
al so important? These results indicate that it may be
possible to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy
by pre-treatment of cancer patients with drugs such as
Nutlin-3a or combinations of rapamycin and metformin
to preserve the potential of the normal cells to recover
after chemotherapeutic drug treatment. That is the normal
cells will undergo G1 or G2 arrest and not be sensitive
to the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs (See Figure 1).
In contrast, cells with mutant p53 will not undergo G1
or G2 arrest and they will be sensitive to the effects of
the chemotherapeutic drugs. The authors have proposed
potential clinical trials to test these important hypotheses.
There are two critical keys to these important
observations, cancer cells have two potential Achilles
heels, they are often mutant at p53 and they also require
high concentrations of glucose to proliferate (Warburg
effect) via activation of glycolysis followed by lactic acid
fermentation. Apontes et al exploited the p53 mutation

The central dilemma in chemotherapy is to eliminate
the rapidly proliferating cancer cells, while leaving the
“normal” cells alone as much as possible. Limiting the
detrimental side effects of mitotic inhibitors on normal
cells could significantly enhance successful chemotherapy
[1]. Mitotic inhibitors often kill normal proliferating
(cycling) cells such as bone marrow cells, hair follicles,
mucosal and epithelial cells [1-3]. These side effects
can be severe in some cases and limit the benefits of
chemotherapy as well as suppress the desirability of
this type of cancer therapy by certain patients. A central
question remains how we can improve on chemotherapy
but reduce its detrimental side effects.
Approximately 50% of human cancers have
mutations which eliminate the functions of p53. However,
the normal cells in these cancer patients possess wild-type
(WT) p53. p53 is often activated by chemotherapeutic
drugs [1,4,5]. The exciting studies by Apontes et al,
published in Oncotarget [1], convincingly demonstrate
that treatment of cells containing WT p53 but not cells
containing mutant p53 with the MDM-2 inhibitor Nutlin3a [6] would protect p53 WT cells put not p53 mutant
cells from the effects of mitotic inhibitors such as
paclitaxel and nocodazole. p53 is normally not a stable
protein due to its ubiquitination by the MDM2 ubiquitin
ligase. Nutlin-3a acts by inhibiting MDM2 which results
in p53 stabilization. In essence, these important results
stem from the basic biological fact that mitotic inhibitors
cannot cause mitotic arrest in cells that do not enter
mitosis. Thus in normal cells, a transient arrest in either
G1 or G2 stimulated by Nutlin-3a treatment, will protect
them from the catastrophic mitotic arrest induced by
mitotic inhibitors such as paclitaxel or nocodazole.

have demonstrated the importance of the p53 and mTOR
pathways in regulating senescence and quiescence [12].
While DNA damaging drugs will induce p53 in
cells with WT p53, which does to an extent provide some
protection to the cells, the effects of DNA damaging
drugs are not always reversible. Thus more effective and
reversible inducers of p53 have been desired. The small
molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3a is an effective inducer of p53
in cells with WT p53 which is more reversible [6,12].
The mTOR pathway is critical in nutrient sensing
[9-11]. It can be regulated by the drugs rapamycin or
metformin which act at different points in the pathway.
Rapamycin targets the key complex mTORC1 which is
very important in the regulation of translation of mRNAs
critical in cell growth and survival. Rapamycin is used to
treat organ transplant patients and is also being evaluated
as an anti-cancer and anti-aging drug. Rapamycin would
further potentiate the protective effects of Nutlin-3a
on cells with WT-p53. Furthermore the combination of
rapamycin and metformin would further increase the

effect by determining the ability of the MDM-2 inhibitor
Nutlin-3A to protect three different human cell lines
with WT p53 cells: WI-38t (fibroblast immortalized with
telomerase), retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) ARPE-19,
and normal kidney epithelial (NKE) by pretreatment from
the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and nocodazole. Nutlin3a causes G1 and/or G2 arrest in cells with WT p53, but
not in cells with mutant p53 (MDA-MB-231, metastatic
breast cancer cell line with mutant p53). Thus the cancer
cells with mutant p53 were sensitive to the effects of
paclitaxel and nocodazole and underwent lethal mitotic
arrest even after the removal of the mitotic inhibitors
and did not regrow when the drugs were removed. In
contrast, cells with WT p53 did not undergo lethal mitotic
arrest and recovered and formed colonies. Likewise a
combination of rapamycin and metformin induced G1
and G2 arrest in normal cells and protected them from the
mitotic inhibitors (See Figure 2). These results were also
observed in low glucose conditions which are toxic for
the cancer cells. Other studies by this same research group

Figure 1: Exploiting the p53 Gene Status to Induce Mitotic Catastrophe in p53 Mutant Cells but not in Normal Cells. On
the left hand side of the figure labeled A, cells with WT p53 undergo cell cycle arrest upon treatment with Nutlin-3a. However if they are then
treated with chemotherapeutic drugs they do not under go mitotic catastrophe. If the chemotherapeutic drug is removed effectively, the normal
cells will recover, resume cell cycle progression and grow. On the right hand side of the figure labeled B, in p53 mutant cells, the cells do not
undergo cell cycle arrest upon treatment with Nutlin-3a. Then upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, the cycling cells undergo mitotic
catastrophe.

inducing p53 by pre-treatment with Nutlin-3a in cancer
patients may synergize with two clinically approved
drugs which target the mTOR pathway, rapamycin and
metformin to save the normal cells but kill the malignant
cells upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment.

protective effect. This is most likely due to the different
molecular effects of rapamycin and metformin on the
mTOR complex. Rapamycin blocks mTORC1 activity
[10, 11], while metformin blocks mTORC1 activity by
perhaps multiple mechanisms depending upon the cell
type. In some cases metformin may affect Rag GTPases
[13] while in other cases metformin may inhibit the master
metabolic regulator, energy-sensing AMP-dependent
protein kinase (AMPK) which normally activates TSC2 and inhibits Raptor [14]. Metformin and rapamycin
also protected normal cells in low glucose conditions.
In contrast, the malignant cells, due to their dependence
on high concentrations of glucose for rapid growth, were
very sensitive to the effects of metformin and rapamycin
in low glucose conditions suggesting that dietary (caloric)
restrictions may aid in certain cancer therapies. Indeed, it
has become clear over the past few years that obesity can
contribute to cancer [7,8] and lowering caloric intake may
augment cancer therapies [15, 16]. High caloric intake
increases mTOR activity and can contribute to insulinresistance, diabetes, obesity and augment cancer growth
and premature aging.
The results presented in the exciting manuscript by
Apontes et al, provide a medical hypothesis by which

Targeting mTORC1 and MDM2 and Suppressing Detrimental Effects of Chemotherapy in p53 WT Cells. Metformin and

Rapamycin both suppress mTORC1 but by inhibiting different molecular targets. In the studies by Apontes et al, they have shown that both
of these mTORC1 inhibitors can interact with Nutlin-3a to protect p53 WT cells but kill p53 mutant cells. Cancer cells are highly sensitive to
drugs which target mTORC1, due to the Warburg effect.
