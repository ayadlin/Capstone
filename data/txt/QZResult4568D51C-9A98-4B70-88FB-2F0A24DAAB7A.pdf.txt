ABSTRACT
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a central enzyme in the metabolic
reprogramming of cancer cells, providing activated one-carbon units in the serineglycine one-carbon metabolism. Previous studies demonstrated that the cytoplasmic
isoform of SHMT (SHMT1) plays a relevant role in lung cancer. SHMT1 is overexpressed
in lung cancer patients and NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, SHMT1 is required to maintain
DNA integrity. Depletion in lung cancer cell lines causes cell cycle arrest and uracil
accumulation and ultimately leads to apoptosis. We found that a pyrazolopyran
compound, namely 2.12, preferentially inhibits SHMT1 compared to the mitochondrial
counterpart SHMT2. Computational and crystallographic approaches suggest binding
at the active site of SHMT1 and a competitive inhibition mechanism. A radio isotopic
activity assay shows that inhibition of SHMT by 2.12 also occurs in living cells.
Moreover, administration of 2.12 in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines causes
apoptosis at LD50 34 μM and rescue experiments underlined selectivity towards
SHMT1. These data not only further highlight the relevance of the cytoplasmic isoform
SHMT1 in lung cancer but, more importantly, demonstrate that, at least in vitro, it is
possible to find selective inhibitors against one specific isoform of SHMT, a key target
in metabolic reprogramming of many cancer types.

INTRODUCTION

subset of human tumors, including melanoma, breast
and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a significant
amount of the glycolytic carbon is redirected into the
synthesis of serine. Serine anabolism then fuels the
de novo biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines and the
production of antioxidant molecules [2–4]. Thus, serine/
glycine one-carbon (SGOC) metabolism and, in particular,
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), the enzyme
providing activated one-carbon units by converting
serine and tetrahydrofolate (H4PteGlu) to glycine and 5,

A major feature distinguishing cancer cells
from non-malignant cells is their ability to grow and
divide uncontrollably. To deal with the increasing
needs caused by active proliferation, cells shift their
metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis to enhance
production of biosynthetic intermediates. Indeed, in the
last few years, reprogramming of cellular metabolism
has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer [1]. In a

10-CH2-H4PteGlu (ME-THF), represent focal points of the
metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells.
In humans, two SHMT genes are found: SHMT1,
which encodes the cytoplasmic isozyme (SHMT1) and
SHMT2, encoding the mitochondrial one (SHMT2) [5].
These two isoforms display a 66% amino acid sequence
identity. SHMT2 also encodes a second transcript
SHMT2α that lacks the mitochondrial import signal, and
is thus localized in the cytoplasm [6]. SHMT2 seems
preferentially involved in the synthesis of glycine and
mitochondrial dTMP [7, 8], while SHMT1 and, to a
lower extent (25%), SHMT2α participate to the synthesis
of dTMP, undergoing nuclear import during S-phase
and supplying ME-THF during the thymidylate cycle,
along with thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) [9]. SHMT2 has been recently shown to
be upregulated under hypoxic conditions [10], producing
glycine and ME-THF and thereby increasing the synthesis
of NADPH, which is necessary to counteract the increase
in oxidative stress experienced under low oxygen tension.
SHMT1 polymorphisms have been associated with
increased lung cancer risk [11]. We recently demonstrated
that SHMT1 plays a relevant role in lung cancer, as it is
overexpressed in tissue samples from lung cancer patients
and NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of SHMT1
in lung cancer cells triggers cell cycle arrest and, during
DNA replication, uracil accumulation causing apoptosis in
a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, nuclear localization
of SHMT1 is required to maintain DNA integrity [12].
Lung cancer remains the most common cancer in the
world, both in term of new cases and deaths because of the
high case fatality [13]. The role played by SHMT at the
crossroads of different key metabolic pathways (serine/
glycine and nucleotide/folate metabolism) makes it a
potential target of novel chemotherapeutic drugs [14–16].
Despite its relevance, only a few studies that focus on drug
design strategies and discovery of compounds that can
inhibit SHMT have been carried out to date. The search
for selective serine analogues and amino acid derivatives
as SHMT inhibitors has not been successful [17].
Antimetabolites, the drugs quenching the effects
of metabolites on cellular processes, are a landmark in
anticancer therapy. The only antifolate compounds with
anticancer activity found to inhibit SHMT, apparently
irreversibly, were the quite toxic sulphonyl fluoride
triazine derivatives [18]. Leucovorin (5-CHO-H4PteGlu)
has been indicated as another inhibitor of both SHMT
isoforms, with preference for SHMT1 over SHMT2.
Unfortunately, it cannot be used clinically as an SHMT
inhibitor, as it is converted to other folic acid derivatives
(e.g., H4PteGlu) and thus has vitamin activity, equivalent
to that of folic acid [19]. We have recently identified two
other antifolates, pemetrexed [20] and lometrexol [21],
which act in vitro as micromolar inhibitors of SHMT.
However, these are both multitarget antifolates, approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for

the treatment of mesothelioma (in combination with
cisplatin) and NSCLC.
A novel set of 338 molecules sharing a
pyrazolopyran scaffold were recently reported in a
patent application by BASF AG (WO 2013182472 A1)
as plant SHMT inhibitors with IC50 values in the low
micromolar/nanomolar range. Given the key role played
by plant SHMT in the photorespiration cycle, controlling
the formyl-transfer between glycine and serine, these
compounds were suggested primarily as weed killers,
but have been recommended also as pharmaceutically
active ingredients for treating or preventing parasitic
and/or bacterial infections. More recently, it was shown
that some of those pyrazolopyrans are also active
against the Plasmodium falciparum SHMT protein [23].
These two facts prompted us to test a low and a high
activity compound from the WO 2013182372 A1 patent
application against human SHMTs with the objective of
performing preliminary assessment of the activity and
potential of this pyrazolopyran class as human SHMT
inhibitors. We randomly selected compounds 2.2 and
2.12 (Figure 1) for further experimentation. Here we
demonstrate that, unlike compound 2.2 that shows a low
affinity for both human SHMTs, compound 2.12 ((4R)6-amino-4-ethyl-4-(3, 5-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrano[2,3-c]
pyrazole-5-carbonitrile) is able to selectively inhibit
the human cytoplasmic isoform of SHMT versus the
mitochondrial one. In addition, treatment of lung cancer
cells with compound 2.12 induces cell death through the
activation of apoptosis. Our data open the possibility of
designing a new generation of effective chemotherapeutic
agents acting as selective SHMT inhibitors based on this
scaffold.

RESULTS
Inhibition of SHMT cytosolic and mitochondrial
isoforms by compounds 2.2 and 2.12
Initially, compounds 2.2 and 2.12 (Figure 1) were
tested on purified recombinant SHMT1 and SHMT2
isoforms using a spectrophotometric assay, in which the
inhibitors and H4PteGlu compete for binding to the same
site of the enzyme [20, 21]. Both isozymes (5.5 µM)
were incubated with a saturating concentration of glycine
(3.0 mM), in the presence of 20 µM H4PteGlu and a
varying concentration of either compound 2.12 or 2.2.
The activity of the enzyme was calculated from the
spectrophotometric measurement of the quinonoid
intermediate that develops when both glycine and
H4PteGlu bind to SHMT [20]. The estimated inhibition
constants (IC50) were: for SHMT1, 154.5 ± 14.4 μM with
compound 2.2 (Supplemental Figure 1) and 57.9 ± 5.5 μM
with compound 2.12 (Figure 2A); for SHMT2, 262.8 ±
48.0 μM with compound 2.2 (Supplementary Figure 1) and
227.2 ± 38.0 μM with compound 2.12 (Figure 2A). This

encouraging result with compound 2.12 was confirmed in
a second inhibition assay using a radioisotopic method,
with known specificity for SHMT [12], and which
measures the rate of exchange of tritium from H3-glycine
to water. In this assay, the enzyme concentration was
43 nM, H4PteGlu was 20 µM, glycine was 23 µM and
compound 2.12 concentration varied between 9.75 µM
and 156 µM. Calculated inhibition constants in the latter
assay were 59.6 ± 4.6 µM for SHMT1 and 252.8 ± 30.7
µM for SHMT2 for 2.12 (Figure 2B). Considering the
ability of 2.12 to selectively target human SHMT1 and the
high inhibition constant of 2.2, we decided to focus our
attention on 2.12 in subsequent experiments.

group of 2.12 and the backbone carbonyls of Leu143
and Gly147. The N2 of the pyrazole moiety undergoes
hydrogen bonding to Glu75. A small pocket formed by
residues Asn385-Asn387 is filled by the ethyl group at the
chiral center of 2.12. The 3, 5-substituted phenyl group
consists of two hydrophobic Cl atoms, one pointing to a
small lateral pocket and making contact with Tyr83 and
Lys386, and the other one further extending along the
active site channel and engaging in nonpolar interactions
along the channel.

Involvement of a flexible loop in 2.12 binding
The IC50 of 2.12 for Plasmodium falciparum SHMT
is 280 nM ([23]; compound number 44 in table S1 of
Supporting Information). In order to derive a structurebased rationale for the observed difference of affinity
displayed by 2.12 for human and Plasmodium SHMT,
we compared the binding mode of 2.12 to the active
sites of both enzymes, using as reference the crystal
structure of Plasmodium vivax SHMT in complex with a
pyrazolopyran compound ([23] PDB: 4TMR; 83% identity
with Plasmodium falciparum SHMT) (Figure 3C). As
SHMT is an enzyme of pivotal importance for nucleotide
synthesis, it is not surprising that its overall structure,
and in particular the residues composing the active
site, are well conserved through evolution. Residues of
Plasmodium SHMT binding to the pyrazolopyran scaffold
[23] are invariant in human SHMT1 and SHMT2. The
only exception is Thr183 of Plasmodium SHMT, which
is conservatively replaced by Ser203 in human SHMT1
(Ser205 in SHMT2). The difference of affinity displayed
by 2.12 for human and Plasmodium falciparum SHMTs
may in part be due to this Ser/Thr substitution. Another
key structural difference between Plasmodium vivax
SHMT and human SHMT1 lies in the loop region formed
by the residues Asn387-Ser399 in human SHMT1 and the
equivalent residues Asn356-Ser368 in Plasmodium vivax.

Predicted binding mode of 2.12 to human SHMT1
Based on the recently solved crystal structure
of Plasmodium vivax SHMT in complex with the
pyrazolopyran compound 5-{3-[(4S)-6-amino-5-cyano3-methyl-4-(propan-2-yl)-2, 4-dihydro pyrano[2, 3-c]
pyrazol-4-yl]-5-cyanophenyl}thiophene-2-carboxylate
([23] PDB: 4TMR), a template-based docking of 2.12 was
carried out into the active site of human SHMT1 (Figure
3A). Compound 2.12, like the pyrazolopyran in the 4TMR
crystal structure, is predicted to occupy the H4PteGlu
binding site of human SHMT1. The binding location of
2.12 was confirmed via low-resolution crystallographic
data (4.2 Å resolution) of human SHMT1 in complex
with 2.12, which showed a positive electron density, up to
5.0 sigma, in agreement with the docking results (Figure
3B). According to the docking results, 2.12 interacts with
human SHMT1 showing a net preference for the (S)absolute configuration, as also observed in Plasmodium
vivax SHMT [23] (Figure 3C).
In our model, a polar environment encloses the
pyrazolopyran moiety of 2.12. The backbone of Thr388
forms a hydrogen bond with the cyano group and a
bidentate interaction is formed between the amino

This region, which forms part of the THF binding cleft,
appears to be flexible and has a different conformation
in these structures (Figure 3D). In the docked model, the
Plasmodium vivax SHMT Asn356-Ser368 loop enclose the
hydrophobic Cl atoms of 2.12 in an apolar environment
(which also includes Tyr63) more effectively than the
human SHMT1 and SHMT2 loop. The different residue
composition and conformation that this loop assumes may
explain, from a structural point of view, the difference
in affinity observed for 2.12. The dynamics of this loop
region may also contribute: in molecular dynamics
simulations, this loop displays slightly greater flexibility in
SHMT2, as measured by the root mean squared deviation
in atomic coordinates from the initial structure. Increased
flexibility in the unbound structure implies an increased
entropic penalty upon stabilization by ligand binding.
Perhaps more importantly, as shown in Figure 3E, the
two isoforms sample a different conformational space
of this loop, with SHMT1 displaying a greater tendency
towards enclosing the binding pocket. This indicates
that in SHMT1 this loop may be predisposed toward

conformations that interact with the dichlorobenzene ring
that distinguishes 2.12 from 2.2.

Inhibition of SHMT activity in living cells
Several recent papers describe SHMT2 upregulation
in several cancer cell types, including colon and breast
[24, 25], underlying the relevance of this isoform in
the metabolism of specific cancer cells, where it is
upregulated possibly to counteract redox stress. On the
other hand, we recently demonstrated the crucial role of
SHMT1 for the survival of lung cancer cells; albeit being
overexpressed also in these cells [12], SHMT2 appears to
play a minor role. These data suggest that the two SHMT
isoforms may have distinct functions in different types of
tumours. To test the ability of compound 2.12 to inhibit
SHMT in cancer cells, we measured the SHMT activity in
living cells by a modified version of the above-described
radioisotopic assay [26]. Together with lung cancer cell
lines A549 and H1299, which over-express both SHMT1
and SHMT2 [12], we also used COLO320 cells that over-

(red symbols) SHMT isoforms was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound 2.12. Values are the average ±
standard deviation of three independent measurements. Continuous lines through the experimental points are those obtained from the
least square fitting of data to equation 1. Two different competitive binding assays were carried out. (A) One assay was based on the
spectrophotometric measurement of the quinonoid intermediate that develops when both glycine and H4PteGlu are bound to the enzyme.
Estimated inhibition constants were 57.9 ± 5.5 μM for SHMT1 and 227.2 ± 38.0 μM for SHMT2. (B) The results shown are based on a
radioisotope assay that exploits the capability of SHMT to catalyse the exchange of glycine 2-pro-S proton with the solvent. With this assay,
the calculated inhibition constants were 59.6 ± 4.6 mM for SHMT1 and 252.8 ± 30.7 mM for SHMT2.

express SHMT2 but not SHMT1 (Supplemental Figure 2).
The cultured cells were pre-treated with 2.12 or DMSO
(the solvent in which 2.12 was dissolved) for 1 hour.
Figure 4A shows that 2.12 inhibits the total SHMT activity
in cancer cell lines in a dose dependent manner and that
SHMT activity in lung cancer cells is much more sensitive
to compound 2.12 (IC50 between 11.5 and 34 µM) than in
colon cancer cells (IC50 between 34 and 200 µM). These
data are in agreement with the higher affinity of 2.12 for
SHMT1 observed in tests with purified proteins.
To validate the ability of 2.12 to inhibit SHMT1
in lung cancer cells, we used gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry to evaluate the glycine and serine content

in A549 and H1299 cells treated or not with 2.12. Data
in Figure 4B show a strong decrease in glycine content
in both cells lines after 2.12 treatment. The levels of
serine seem to be slightly increased but this variation is
not statistically significant. Overall, data suggest a direct
effect of 2.12 compound on SHMT(s) in living cells.

Treatment with 2.12 induces cell death in cancer
cells
We previously demonstrated that RNA interference
(RNAi) against SHMT1 induces apoptosis in lung
cancer cell lines [12], via the misincorporation and

accumulation of uracil in DNA. To test the ability of the
SHMT inhibitor 2.12 to induce cell death, we treated the
A549, H1299 and COLO320 cells with different doses of
2.12 for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h and performed trypan blue
exclusion and XTT assays.
Figure 5 shows that 2.12 induces cell death in all
the cell lines tested, as evident in both the trypan blue
exclusion assay, which evaluate dead cells by looking at
cell membrane integrity (Figure 5A) and the XTT, which
highlights cells with active mitochondria (Figure 5B). Both
assays, although with slightly different numbers due to the
different experimental approaches, indicate that the Lethal
Dose50 (LD50) for lung cancer cells is around 34 µM, while
the LD50 for COLO320 cells is between 46 and 92 µM.
These data demonstrate that a lower concentration of 2.12
is needed to kill A549 and H1299 cells compared to the
COLO320 cell line.

The accumulation of cells in the population Annexin-V
positive/7-AAD negative after treatment with 2.12
confirms that the apoptotic mechanism is involved.

Rescue of 2.12-treated lung cancer cells by
metabolites providing one-carbon units
It is well known that adding selected metabolites
can rewire the cellular metabolism, thus bypassing
deficiencies in a given enzyme, as previously shown for
SHMT2 [25]. We employed a similar approach to evaluate
whether the apoptotic effect induced by compound 2.12
was due to the inhibition of the SHMT SER/GLY activity.
The 2.12-treated (34 µM) or untreated A549 and H1299
lung cancer cells were grown in a minimal medium
supplemented or not with serine, glycine and 5-formylTHF (used in these experiments for its higher stability
compared to THF) [21]. The apoptotic rate was evaluated
using PI and annexin-V/7AAD staining. The data in Figure
7A and 7B (PI staining) and 7C and D (Annexin-V/7AAD
staining) demonstrate that the 2.12-induced apoptotic
effect is partially rescued (~ 28%) if the cells are grown in
the supplemented medium, suggesting that SHMT SER/
GLY activity is likely involved in the observed apoptotic
effect.
To validate the selectivity of 2.12 for SHMT1 we
used a parallel strategy, involving the over-expression
of this protein in the selected cell lines starting from
a plasmid-borne gene; SHMT1 overexpression was
confirmed by western blot (Supplemental Figure 3). The
effect of compound 2.12 (34 µM) on cells transfected with
the plasmid encoding SHMT1 was evaluated by studying

2.12 induces cell death through an apoptotic
process
To clarify if the 2.12-mediated induction of lung
cancer cell death is due to the activation of an apoptotic
process, we used PI and Annexin-V staining. Figure 6A
and 6B shows that 2.12 induces the accumulation of a
subG1 population of A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells
after 48 hours of treatment, clearly indicating an apoptotic
phenomenon, with a strong induction (around 40% for
A549 and 25% for H1299) at the concentration of 34
µM. Figure 6C and 5D shows the same cell lines after
treatment with 2.12 (34 µM for 48 h) together with the
control untreated samples, both stained with annexin-V.

cell viability (XTT assay). Figure 7E shows that SHMT1
overexpression is able to partially rescue (~30%) the death
effect induced in A549 cells by treatment with 2.12 (34.5
and 46 µM) indicating that SHMT1 is a direct target of
2.12. Unfortunately, when using H1299 cells in the same
experiment, we did not reach statistical significance
despite several repeats, although we observed a similar
trend (Figure 7F). We have previously shown that the
expression of SHMT1 and SHMT2 are interconnected and
there are differences in the response to SHMT modulation
in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines [12]. SHMT1
overexpression in H1299 cells causes a strong downregulation of SHMT2 (Supplemental Figure 4), which

is less evident in A549 cells. This crosstalk between
the expression of the two SHMT isoforms, particularly
in H1299 cells, may have ultimately prevented a clear
response with this cell line in the above experiments.

DISCUSSION
SHMTs are key enzymes in the metabolism of
several cancer cell types, including lung, colon and
breast [12, 25]. They occupy a key position in the
complex SGOC pathway, controlling the production of
DNA bases, metabolic intermediates and antioxidant
molecules that are fundamental for rapidly proliferating

cells. In a recent patent application by BASF AG (WO
2013182472 A1) several pyrazolopyran compounds were
disclosed as inhibitors of Arabidopsis thaliana SHMT
activity. Moreover, a recent paper demonstrated that
molecules from the pyrazolopyran series are also active
against the SHMT activity of Plasmodium falciparum.
In this work we have selected two representatives of the
pyrazolopyran scaffold and tested in vitro their ability to
block the activity of human SHMTs. Our results show that
compound 2.12 behaves as an antifolate, binding to the
THF site in human SHMTs, but is less active towards the
human enzymes than pfSHMT. This demonstrates that,
although SHMTs from different sources are structurally
very similar, small differences can have a large effect
on ligand and/or cofactor binding and on inhibitory
potential. Our experiments also show that among human
SHMT isoforms, SHMT1 is more effectively inhibited by
compound 2.12 than SHMT2. Our in vitro data suggests

that it may be possible to design pyrazolopyran-type
inhibitors of human SHMT which selectively inhibit one
isoform of the enzyme over the other.
The ability of 2.12 to inhibit human SHMTs was
also demonstrated in living cells. Our experiments do not
allow us to assess the individual contribution of the two
isoforms to the overall SHMT activity in cells. However,
we were able to demonstrate that treatment with 2.12 led to
significant decrease of glycine levels in lung cancer cells.
This result is in agreement with an inhibitory effect of 2.12
on SHMT activity. A concomitant large increase in serine
concentration would also be expected, yet we observed
only a small, non-significant increase of serine. We believe
that this is due to serine consumption by the activity of
SHMT2 in the mitochondria which is probably unaffected
by 2.12, given the observed low inhibitory effect of this
compound on SHMT2. Serine would therefore enter the
mitochondria and be consumed in the SHMT2-catalysed

conversion into glycine and ME-THF. In turn, glycine
would be irreversibly oxidized to CO2 and ME-THF by
the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system. The formate
derived from ME-THF would then be exported to the
cytosol where it is converted into folate-activated carbon
units [27, 28]. Our previously published data demonstrate
that, differently from other cancer cell types, lung cancer
cells are extremely sensitive to SHMT1 levels [12]. RNAi
against this protein induces apoptosis at a higher level
compared to RNAi against SHMT2, which is generally
considered a more suitable target for chemotherapy [25].
Considering the ability of 2.12 to preferentially inhibit
human SHMT1, we treated lung and colon cancer cell
types with this compound and studied the induction of cell
death. We demonstrated that lung cancer cells are more

sensitive to 2.12 when compared to colon cancer cells, and
we suggest that this difference could be ascribed, at least
in part, to the differential expression of SHMT1 in these
cell lines.
A more detailed analysis demonstrated that the
2.12-induced cell death is attributable to an apoptotic
signal. Rescue experiments have been previously used
to confirm the ability of an inhibitor to block an enzyme
in a specific metabolic process. In our experiments,
supplementation of glycine, serine and 5-formyl-THF
promotes a ~30% recovery from the 2.12-induced
apoptosis and suggests that 2.12 inhibits SHMT activity
in living cells. Recovery to the same extent (~about 30%)
was also observed after overexpression of SHMT1 in

Inhibition experiments on purified recombinant
SHMT isoforms

correlates with the results obtained with the medium
supplementation experiments mentioned above. A more
complex picture was observed with 2.12-treated H1299
cells in which SHMT1 was overexpressed to counteract
the inhibitory effect of 2.12. In these experiments a rescue
trend similar to the one observed with the A549 cells was
observed, but it did not reach statistical significance. The
lack of a clear rescue effect with the H1299 cell line may
be due to the reduction of SHMT2 expression that has
been observed in H1299, but not in the A549 SHMT1
overexpressing cells, that may alter the overall flux of
metabolites in the SGOC pathway.
In conclusion, the results of this work demonstrate
that 2.12 is able to induce a strong apoptotic signal in
lung cancer cells. At this stage we cannot exclude that
2.12 may inhibit enzymes other than SHMT involved in
the folate cycle and further studies will be carried out to
evaluate other possible target(s). Moreover, the present
data support the potential of a differential inhibition of the
two human SHMT isozymes with compounds based on the
pyrazolopyran scaffold.

Inhibition of SHMT activity by compound 2.12
was tested using competitive binding assays in which the
antifolate competes for binding with H4PteGlu. The first
assay is based on the spectrophotometric measurement
of the quinonoid intermediate that develops when both
glycine and H4PteGlu bind to SHMT, forming an enzymeglycine-folate ternary complex [20]. The quinonoid
intermediate, which yields an intense absorption band with
a maximum at around 500 nm, derives from deprotonation
of glycine, but it accumulates to a measurable extent
only when a folate ligand is also bound to SHMT and a
ternary complex is formed [33]. Therefore, absorbance at
500 nm is proportional to the fraction of enzyme present
as ternary complex. The assay was carried out at 30°C in
20 mM KPi buffer pH 7.2. Compound 2.12 was dissolved
in pure DMSO. The effect of DMSO concentration on
quinonoid development was analysed and found to be
negligible up to 20% DMSO (v/v). In all inhibition
assays, DMSO final concentration was 5% (v/v) and
H4PteGlu was added as last component. After a rapid
manual mixing, the absorbance change at 500 nm was
measured. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
Inhibition curves were fitted to Eq. 1, in which [I] is the
concentration of the inhibitor, to obtain the observed
inhibition constants (Ki).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compounds 2.12 and 2.2
Compounds 2.2 and 2.12 were prepared as described
in WO2013/182472 A1 [22].

Needle-shaped crystals were obtained by mixing
equal volumes of a solution containing 50 µM human
SHMT1, 40 mM glycine and 400 µM of 2.12 (or 2.2)
inhibitor with a crystallization solution containing tripotassium citrate and PEG 3350. A low-resolution
(4.2 Å) complete data-set, collected at ESRF ID23.1
beamline, was processed with XDS [29] and phased by
molecular replacement with MOLREP [30] using SHMT1
structure as template PDB code: 1BJ4 [15]. The space
group was P212121 with unit cell constants; a = 140.38,
b = 140.52, c = 268.39. The crystals were twinned with
twin operator -k,-h,-l originating a pseudo tetrameric
symmetry. Final model consisted of 8 mol/AU and was
refined in REFMAC5  [31] to a final Rwork and Rfree of
32.7 and 33.7, respectively. The resolution of the electron
density maps was too low to build a reliable model of
the inhibitor, however a positive electron density up to 5
sigma was observed in the Fobs−Fcal map.

Fitting of data was performed with the software
PRISM (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). The second
radioisotope assay was based on the capability of SHMT
to catalyse the exchange of the pro-2S proton of glycine
with solvent [26]. SHMT activity was determined by
incubating 23 mM [2−3H]glycine (2 × 109 dpm µmol−1)
and 20 mM H4PteGlu with increasing concentrations
(from 9.75 to 156 mM) of compound 2.12 in 70 µl of
20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2. Control
reactions were performed to correct for background
exchange by the addition of 0.5 mM 5-CHO-H4PteGlu.
Reactions were started by the addition of glycine and
incubated at 30°C for 2 h. After incubation, reactions were
stopped by the addition of 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid
and treated as previously detailed [26] so as to remove
radiolabeled glycine and measure radioactivity in the
solvent. All measurements were performed in triplicate.

H1299 and COLO320 cell lines grown in complete
medium RPMI-1640 were detached using trypsin,
centrifuged and suspended twice in 2 ml of PBS buffer
to eliminate the growth medium; 100 ml aliquots of cell
suspension were incubated with increasing concentrations
of compound 2.12 (from 9 to 315 mM) at 37°C for 2 h.
Glycine (23 mM) was then added to the samples, which
were further incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. At this point,
samples were centrifuged to remove cells, reactions were
stopped by the addition of 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid
and treated as previously detailed [26] so as to remove
radiolabeled glycine and measure radioactivity in the
solvent. Control reactions were performed to correct for
background exchange (these samples did not contain cells)
and to measure 100% of activity (these sample did not
contain the inhibitor). All measurements were performed
in duplicate.

dimer structures using the fully resolved mouse dimeric
structure (PDB 1EJI) as a template. Missing loops in the
SHMT2 structure (distant from the active site) were built
using I-TASSER [37]. Systems were solvated in a TIP3P
octahedral 12Å water box and two rounds of minimization
and molecular dynamics equilibration were applied prior
to the production run of 100 ns. Complete simulation
parameters are provided in the supplementary information.

Cell lines
COLO320 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
VA, USA). A549, H1299 and COLO320 cancer cells
were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin,
and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA). The rescue experiments were performed
in A549 and H1299 cancer cells grown in Miminum
Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 1X MEM Vitamin Solution, 2 mM L-glutamine,
25 mM glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum dialyzed, 100 IU/ml
penicillin/streptomycin and 0.4 mM serine, 0.4 mM glycine
and 0.02 mM 5-formyl-THF (Merck Eprova AG).

Docking of 2.12 to SHMT1
The crystal structure of SHMT1 in its biologically
active tetrameric form, and in complex with PLP as
internal aldimine [15], was used as a starting point to
model the “closed” form of the enzyme in complex with
PLP-glycine, as previously described [20]. The Dundee
PRODRG2 Server was used to build the energy minimized
three-dimensional structure of 2.12 [34]. Template-based
molecular docking was carried out by means of Molegro
Virtual Docker (MVD) software (®CLCbio). Flexible
torsions of 2.12 were automatically detected by MVD,
and manually checked for consistency. The obtained threedimensional structure of human SHMT1 was prepared by
automatically assigning bond orders and hybridization, and
adding explicit hydrogens, charges and Tripos atom types.
A search space of 15 Å radius, centered on the active site
cavity, was used for docking. The pyrazolopyran skeleton
of CAS 1508291-70-0 was taken as pharmacophoric group
for template-based dockings [22]. In the latter, if an atom
of the ligand matches a group definition, it is rewarded
by using a weighted score that depends on its distance to
the group centers. The grid-based MolDock score with
a grid resolution of 0.30 Å was used as scoring function
and MolDock SE was used as docking algorithm [35].
For each ligand, ten runs were defined. Similar poses
(RMSD ≤ 1.0 Å) were clustered, and the best scoring one
was taken as representative. Other docking parameters
were fixed at their default values. After docking, energy
optimization of hydrogen bonds was performed.

Chemicals and reagents
2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylamine, ethyl chloroformate,
diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Sample extraction and derivatization
Serine and Glycine were analyzed according to the
method of Gao et al. with slight modification [38]. Cell
(A549 and H1299) pellets were suspended in 100 µl of
chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1 ratio) at 4oC and mixed
vigorously to break up the pellet. After centrifugation for
3 min (13,000 g at 4oC) the supernatant was collected,
dried under N2, resuspended in 500 µl of water and spiked
with 20 µl of 0.7 mM 2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylamine. The
first step of derivatization was performed by adding 350 µl
of ethanol/pyridine (6:1) and 50 µl of ethyl chloroformate
(ECF). The reaction mixture was then vortexed for 30
sec and ultrasonicated for 60 sec to increase the speed of
reaction at room temperature. The derivatization products
were extracted with 700 µl of n-hexane for 60 sec and
centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. The organic layer was
removed and the aqueous phase was adjusted to pH ≥12
with 100 µl 7M NaOH. The second derivatization step
was performed by adding further 50 µl of ECF and 700 µl
of n-hexane. The reaction mixture was again vortexed for
30 sec, ultrasonicated for 60 sec, and centrifuged at 3000
rpm for 10 min. The organic layers were combined, dried
under N2, resuspended in dichloromethane and analyzed
by GC/MS.

Molecular dynamics
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed
using version 14 of Amber with the Amber14ffsb force
field. Monomeric structures of human SHMT1 (PDB
1BJ4) and SHMT2 (PDB 4PVF) were assembled into

Diego, CA, USA), antibody anti-SHMT2, -β-actin and
the secondary antibodies anti-goat and -mouse were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

GC-M analyses were performed with an Agilent
6850A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973N quadrupole
mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). Chromatographic separations were
carried out with an Agilent HP5ms fused-silica capillary
column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.) coated with 5%- phenyl95%-dimethylpolysiloxane (film thickness 0.25 μm) as
stationary phase. Injection mode: splitless at a temperature
of 280°C. Column temperature program: 80°C (2 min)
ramped to 140°C at a rate of 10°C/min, to 240°C at a rate
of 4°C/min, to 280°C at a rate of 10°C/min and held for
5 min. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow of
1.0 ml/min. The spectra were obtained in the electron
impact mode at 70 eV ionization energy; ion source 280°C;
ion source vacuum 10−5 Torr. MS analysis was performed
simultaneously in TIC (mass range scan from m/z 50 to
600 at a rate of 0.42 scans s−1) and SIM mode. GC-SIMMS analysis was performed selecting the following ions:
m/z 102 for glycine, m/z 114 for serine and m/z 227 for 3,
4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (internal standard).

Trypan blue exclusion assay
The cells were harvested and washed in cold PBS
two times, following the addition of a 0.4% (w/v) trypan
blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich), cells were counted using
a Burker chamber (Hirschmann, Germany) under an
Axioskop 2 plus microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Switzerland). Cells staining with trypan blue dye were
counted as nonviable.

XTT assay
In order to determine the percentage of viable
cells this assay employs 2, 3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide salt (XTT).
Only in living cells are mitochondria capable of reducing
XTT to form an orange colored dye. Therefore, the
concentration of the dye is proportional to the number of
metabolically active cells. Approximately 1200 cells/well
were plated in 96-well dishes in complete medium RPMI1640. After 24 h, 48 h and 72 h cells were treated for
72 h, 48 h and 24 h by adding complete medium and 2.12
compound at different concentrations. Each test includes
a blank containing complete medium without cells and
a negative control made up of 2.12 untreated cells. XTT
mix reaction (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany)
was prepared and then added to cell cultures according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After 3 h in
CO2 incubator at 37°C, the absorbance of samples was
measured by a spectrophotometer Appliskan Multimode
Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA
USA) at a wavelength of 470 nm. In order to measure
non-specific reading the absorbance of samples was
measured also at a wavelength of 690 nm and then
subtracted from the 470 nm measurement to measure
reference absorbance. The percentage of metabolically
active cells was calculated according to the following
formula ((Abs sample – Abs Blank)/(Abs Neg Control –
Abs Blank)) × 100.

RNA extraction and real-time qRT–PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instruction and
1 μg was used for the reverse transcription reaction by
using a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System Kit
(Invitrogen). One microliter of the 1:50 dilution of the
complementary DNA was used for qRT–PCR analysis
performed in triplicate for each sample using KAPA Sybr
Fast universal qPCR Kit following the manufacturer
instructions. Reactions were performed by Stratagene
MX3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Primers used
have been previously reported [12].

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared in 8 M urea (SigmaAldrich) and protein concentration was determined by
Biorad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Munchen, Germany).
Lysates were subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and were transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane then saturated with 5% non fat dry milk
in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at
room temperature. Membranes were incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C and subsequently
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were
washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20
and ECL reagent (Millipore) was used for detection by
chemiluminescence system Chemidoc MP Imaging
System (Bio-Rad). Antibody anti-SHMT1 were from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), the
secondary antibody anti-rabbit were from Abbiotec (San

Apoptosis assay
For PI staining, cells were detached with trypsin,
washed with cold PBS plus 5% FCS and then fixed in
70% ethanol for 24 h. After washing with PBS, cells
were incubated with 1 μg/ml PI for 3 h at 25°C before
cytometric analysis by BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Results
were analyzed with BD Accuri C6 software and were
presented as a percentage of specific apoptosis determined
using the following formula: ((% apoptotic cells in

AnnexinV staining: cells were detached with trypsin,
washed with PBS–5% FCS and then placed in binding
buffer (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) to which
7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and AnnexinV-APC
(Pharmingen) were added prior to cytometric analysis.
Cells were considered apoptotic when Annexin-V-APC
positive and 7-AAD negative.
