Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Repress Tumoral
Expression of the Proinvasive Factor RUNX2

Abstract
Aberrant reactivation of embryonic pathways occurs commonly in cancer. The transcription factor RUNX2 plays a fundamental
role during embryogenesis and is aberrantly reactivated during
progression and metastasization of different types of human
tumors. In this study, we attempted to dissect the molecular
mechanisms governing RUNX2 expression and its aberrant reactivation. We identiﬁed a new regulatory enhancer element, located within the RUNX2 gene, which is responsible for the activation
of the RUNX2 promoter and for the regulation of its expression in
cancer cells. Furthermore, we have shown that treatment with the

anticancer compounds histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)
results in a profound inhibition of RUNX2 expression, which is
determined by the disruption of the transcription-activating complex on the identiﬁed enhancer. These data envisage a possible
targeting strategy to counteract the oncongenic function of
RUNX2 in cancer cells and provide evidence that the cytotoxic
activity of HDACi in cancer is not only dependent on the reactivation of silenced oncosuppressors but also on the repression of
oncogenic factors that are necessary for survival and progression.

Introduction

regulated through different mechanisms (24–27). Indeed, evidence exists that the use of the two promoters is context dependent. In particular, our group and others have shown that RUNX2
isoform I is the major RUNX2 isoform in tumor cells, while
isoform II seems to be restricted to skeletal cells (16, 26). Noticeably, the majority of molecular signals known to control RUNX2
act through the P1 promoter, while the regulation of the P2
promoter remains largely unknown (28–30). Dissecting the
mechanisms controlling RUNX2 P2 promoter is a necessary step
to elucidate the complex network of molecular determinants that
govern RUNX2 expression in tumor and it may help designing an
appropriate therapeutic approach to counteract the prometastatic
function of RUNX2.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a class of chemical
compounds that block the activity of Zn-dependent HDAC,
inducing the hyperacetylation of a number of proteins (31).
Histone acetylation is associated with open chromatin structure
and active transcription. Thus, it is believed that the major
anticancer effect of HDACi is due to the reactivation of silent
oncosuppressor genes. However, increasing evidence indicates
that, besides histones, HDACi treatment affects acetylation and
function of a number of nonhistonic proteins, opening new
explanations to the mechanisms of action of these cancer drugs
(32). Recent studies have shown that HDACi suppress the expression of a number of oncogenes that are highly expressed in cancer,
supporting the hypothesis that besides reinducing suppressor
genes, these drugs may impair cancer cell growth by blocking
oncogenic signals that are necessary for tumor survival and
progression (33–35).
In this study, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that HDACi
profoundly impairs the expression of RUNX2 isoform I in tumor
cells. In the attempt to dissect the mechanism responsible for the
HDACi-dependent RUNX2 inhibition, we identiﬁed a new
enhancer within the RUNX2 gene, which is responsible for the
activation of the P2 promoter in tumor cells and contains the
HDACi-responsive elements. We have shown that c-JUN binds to
the ENH3 and is a positive regulator of RUNX2 expression.

RUNX2, a transcription factor belonging to the Runt-related
family, is necessary for osteoblast differentiation and skeletal
morphogenesis (1, 2). Factors that are crucial during embryogenesis are often hijacked during cancer progression, and RUNX2 is
not an exception. RUNX2 is increasingly recognized in cancer
biology for its oncogenic properties and a large number of articles
link the deregulation of RUNX2 expression with progression and
metastasization of different types of epithelial tumors (1, 3–18).
Regulation of RUNX2 may occur at multiple levels and through
multiple signaling pathways. However, the mechanisms that
regulate the reactivation of this factor in cancer are still unknown.
It has been reported that RUNX2 expression is higher in tumor
than in normal tissue and that the level of expression of this
protein has a negative prognostic value in a number of cancer
types (16, 19–22). The RUNX2 gene encodes for two isoforms
starting from two separate promoters: the proximal P2 promoter
expresses RUNX2 isoform I and the distal P1 promoter expresses
isoform II (23, 24). The two isoforms differ for only a few
aminoacids at the N-terminal regions, even though differences
in their activity were reported. The existence of two alternative
promoters suggests that the expression of the two isoforms is

EvaGreen Super Mix (Bio-Rad) in the CFX96 Real Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad).

presence of DNAse I hypersensitivity clusters, and the presence of
speciﬁc histone modiﬁcations associated with enhancer regions
(H3K27Ac and H3K4Me1). Transcription factors–binding sites
analysis on the ENH3 core was performed by merging the data
from the open-source JASPAR database (http://jaspar.genereg.
net/) and by the data retrieved from the TRANSFAC Professional
database (http://www.biobase-international.com/) using the
Match algorithm.
DNase sensitivity assay

HDACi Repress RUNX2 Expression in Tumor Cells

Results
HDACi inhibit RUNX2 expression in thyroid cancer cell lines
Reactivation of crucial factors during cancer progression may be
determined by changes in chromatin organization. We evaluated
the effect of chromatin remodeling agents on RUNX2 expression
in two different papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell lines. TPC1
and BCPAP cells were treated with 5AZA, inhibitor of DNA
methyltransferases, and with TSA and SAHA, inhibitors of HDACs
(Fig. 1A–D). In both cell lines, treatment with TSA and SAHA
resulted in a strong inhibition of RUNX2 expression at the mRNA
and protein level, whereas 5AZA displayed only marginal effects
as compared with control.
We analyzed the kinetic of HDACi effect on RUNX2 expression
(Fig. 1E and F). In both cell lines, RUNX2 mRNA levels decreased
rapidly after TSA exposure and the effect was already detectable
after 3 hours. To assess the reversibility of the HDACi effect on
RUNX2 expression, TPC1 and BCPAP cells were treated with TSA
for 6 hours and then moved to TSA-free medium (Fig. 1G and H).
In both cell lines, inhibition of RUNX2 was completely rescued
after 6 hours from TSA withdrawal. The rapidity of the TSA
mediated inhibition and the ready reversibility of the effect
suggested that HDACi control RUNX2 expression through a direct
mechanism. To test this hypothesis, BCPAP and TPC1 cells were
treated with TSA in the presence or absence of actinomycin D that
inhibits transcription, and cycloheximide that blocks protein
synthesis (Fig. 1I and J). Blockade of transcription by actinomycin
D completely abolishes the effect of TSA on RUNX2 expression in
both cell lines, demonstrating that repression of RUNX2 by TSA
requires active transcription. In contrast, the inhibition of protein
synthesis by cycloheximide did not block the TSA-mediated
RUNX2 repression, demonstrating that the HDACi effect was
mostly direct and did not require synthesis of new factors.
However, in BCPAP cells, cycloheximide treatment slightly
reduced the repressive effect of TSA, suggesting the possible
involvement of additional undirect events in this mechanism.
Next, we investigated the effect of HDACi on RUNX2 mRNA
stability. TPC1 and BCPAP cells were pretreated with TSA for 30
minutes and then actinomycin D was added to halt transcription
(Fig. 1K and L). In both cell lines, degradation rate was similar,
independently from the TSA pretreatment, indicating that HDACi
do not have signiﬁcant effect on RUNX2 mRNA stability. In
addition, luciferase assay has shown that TSA did not target the
RUNX2 30 -UTR, thus ruling out the possibility that HDACi

induced the expression of noncoding RNAs that may affect
RUNX2 stability (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Next, we tested the effect of TSA on RUNX2 promoter activity.
We previously have shown that isoform I is the major RUNX2
isoform expressed in thyroid cancer patients (16). RT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed that isoform II was not detectable in either TPC1 or
BCPAP untreated cells and that TSA did not affect its expression. In
contrast, isoform I was strongly repressed by TSA in both cell lines
(Fig. 2A and B). Thus, we focused our analysis on the P2 promoter.
The full-length RUNX2 P2 promoter, and a shorter region of about
400 bp encompassing the transcriptional starting site (TSS; sP2)
were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and their
transcriptional activity was assessed in the presence or absence
of TSA (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, TSA treatment induced a strong
activation of both the full-length and sP2 promoter in both cell
lines. This observation was in conﬂict with the expression data and
suggested that the HDACi-responsive elements were not located
within the P2 promoter. We also noticed that the P2 promoter was
not able to induce a signiﬁcant activation of the reporter gene in
untreated cells, and that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
activity of the full-length and of the short version of the P2
promoter.
A new enhancer controls RUNX2 expression in thyroid cancer
cells
On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized the existence of
unknown DNA regulatory regions outside the P2 promoter. We
analyzed the annotation data of the ENCODE project to identify
DNA regions within the RUNX2 locus with features of regulatory
elements (36–38). Three potential enhancers (ENH) were identiﬁed and named ENH1, ENH2, and ENH3 (Fig. 2D). Figure 2E
shows the chromatin accessibility of these regions assessed by
DNase sensitivity assay. In both cell lines, ENH1 and ENH2
showed partial accessibility, whereas ENH3 displayed a fully
accessible chromatin structure, comparable with the P2 promoter.
Next, the DNA fragments corresponding to ENH1, 2, and 3 were
cloned into the pGL3-P2 vector downstream of the luciferase
reporter gene and their ability to activate the P2 promoter was
assessed by luciferase assay (Fig. 2F). Only ENH3 determined a
strong induction of the reporter gene, suggesting a potent activity
of this element on the P2 promoter. Noticeably, the activating
effect of ENH3 on the P2 promoter was stronger in TPC1 than in
BCPAP cells, in line with the higher level of RUNX2 expression
detected in TPC1 as compared with BCPAP cells (Fig. 2B; ref. 16).

HDACi Repress RUNX2 Expression in Tumor Cells

Furthermore, ENH3 maintained the ability of activating the
reporter gene when cloned in the inverted orientation and
when cloned in the pGL3 vector containing the sP2 promoter.
Finally, we have shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments that the binding of RNA Polymerase II
(RNA PolII) on the ENH3 was signiﬁcantly enriched as compared with two downstream RUNX2 exons (exons 5 and 7; Fig.
3A and B). This observation is in agreement with the hypothesis
that enhancer elements may function as RNA PolII reservoir,
facilitating the access of the enzyme on the target promoter
(39, 40).
A minimal 30-bp element represents the ENH3 core
With the intent of identifying the minimal DNA regulatory
elements (ENH3 core) of ENH3, we performed a functional
dissection of this region (Fig. 3C). We generated sequential
deletion mutants of the ENH3 and their activity on the sP2
promoter was assessed by luciferase assay (Fig. 3D–F). This
analysis restricted the ENH3 activity to the ENH3.C3 fragment
in the central region of the ENH3 (Fig. 3D and E). This region was
further divided into four fragments (Fig. 3F). Two overlapping
fragments ENH3.C3A and ENH3.C3B retained most of the activity. We reasoned that the 30-bp overlapping region contained the
functional sites of ENH3 and represented the ENH3 core. Noticeably, this region has shown high-grade conservation across species, suggesting a selective pressure to preserve this element during
evolution (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In order to understand
which nucleotides had a relevant function for the activity of
ENH3, we introduced three independent point mutations within
the ENH3 core in the full-length ENH3.C3 fragment (Fig. 4A and
B). G>T substitution in position 1149 (Mut1) and A>T substitution in position 1156 (Mut2) strongly repressed the activity of
ENH3.C3. In contrast, C>G mutation in position 1157 (Mut3)
showed a trend (even if not statistically signiﬁcant) toward
induction, suggesting the possibility that this site negatively
control ENH3 activity. Double mutation G>T and A>T (Mut1þ2)
further decreased the activity of the ENH3.C3 with a signiﬁcant
interaction effect, suggesting a positive cooperation between these
two sites.
Next, we performed electromobility shift assay (EMSA) using
a probe of 47 bp containing the ENH3 core (S3A probe). Figure
4C shows that the radiolabeled S3A probe was bound by a
protein complex in both TPC1 and BCPAP cells and that the
interaction was speciﬁc because the addition of increasing
amounts of a cold WT competitor abolished the binding. We
also performed competition assays using increasing amounts of
Mut1, Mut2, and Mut1þ2 cold competitors. Mut1 displayed
similar competition efﬁciency as the WT competitor in both cell

lines. In contrast, Mut2 displayed partial efﬁciency in competing for the binding as compared with the WT competitor and
the competition efﬁciency was even further decreased when
both positions were mutated in the Mut1þ2 double-mutant
competitor. Also, Mut3 had reduced competition efﬁciency as
compared with the WT probe, suggesting the possibility that
this site participate to the binding of the protein complex to
ENH3 (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S1D).
We used two independent databases (TRANSFAC and JASPAR)
to predict which transcription factors were likely to bind this
region. Thirty-ﬁve and 39 binding sites were predicted respectively. From these lists, we sorted transcription factors whose
binding was abolished by Mut1 and Mut2 and that was not
affected by Mut3. Noticeably, Mut1 and Mut2 affected the binding of two completely distinct sets of transcription factors and
none of the predicted sites was commonly abolished by both
mutations. Therefore, we concluded that the ENH3 core is composed of two adjacent functional sites (sites 1 and 2), which
cooperate in controlling ENH3 activity and RUNX2 expression
(Fig. 4E and F). This model was strongly supported by luciferase
and EMSA data, in which simultaneous mutation of both sites
(Mut1þ2) had a stronger effect on the ENH3 activity than the
single Mut1 and Mut2 substitutions (Fig. 4B and C). Next, we
crossed the results obtained by TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases
in order to ﬁnd binding sites that were predicted by both
approaches. From this search, we obtained a list of ﬁve transcription factors (ETS1, ELK1, ERG, FLI1 belonging to the ETS family,
and NFAT1 belonging to the Rel family) that were predicted to
bind to site 1, and AP1 that was predicted to bind to site 2. We
performed supershift assay using anti-c-JUN antibodies to conﬁrm that AP1 binds to site 2. In both cell lines, the addition of
c-JUN antibodies determined a reduction of the binding of the
protein complex to the S3A probe (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, ChIP
experiments using anti-c-JUN antibodies showed that c-JUN
actively binds to ENH3 in a context of structured chromatin
(Fig. 4H). Finally, we used the S3A probe or the Mut1þ2 double-mutant probe to precipitate binding proteins in a DNA
pulldown assay. Western blot analysis using anti-c-JUN antibodies showed that c-JUN is actively precipitated by the S3A probe
while, double mutation strongly inhibited the binding (Fig. 4I).
All together, these experiments indicate that the ENH3 transcriptional activity is controlled by a multiprotein complex that binds
to a bipartite site within the ENH3 core and showed that AP1 is
one of the components of this functional complex.
The ENH3 contains the HDACi-responsive elements
We tested whether ENH3 was able to mediate the HDACirepressive effect on RUNX2 expression (Fig. 5A). Noticeably, in

cloned into the pGL3 basic vector upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Cells were transfected with the indicated pGL3 constructs and left untreated
(black bars) or treated with TSA (gray bars). For each treatment, the bars represent the average fold change of luciferase activity in pGL3-P2 and pGL3-sP2 vectortransfected cells relative to pGL3-empty vector-transfected cells.

HDACi Repress RUNX2 Expression in Tumor Cells

both cell lines, TSA determined a strong inhibition of the
reporter gene in the presence of the ENH3. The ENH3.C3
region that contains the ENH3 core was sufﬁcient to mediate
the HDACi repression, while single mutation in site 1 or site 2
or double mutation in both sites abolished the response to
HDACi, most likely as a consequence of their deleterious effect
on the ENH3 activity (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S1E). In
contrast, Mut3 did not affect the repressive effect of HDACi on
ENH3, suggesting that this site is not directly involved in the
HDACi-mediated RUNX2 regulation. These results indicated
that the ENH3 and, in particular, the ENH3 core contains the
elements necessary to mediate the HDACi-repressive effect on
RUNX2 expression.
To test the possibility that HDACi alter the formation of the
transcriptional complex on the ENH3, we performed EMSA with
the S3A probe in both TPC1 and BCPAP cells in the presence or
absence of TSA (Fig. 5B). Noticeably, the addition of TSA abolished the binding of the protein complex on the ENH3 core,
pointing to a possible mechanism to explain the HDACi-mediated RUNX2 repression. On the basis of these observations, we
propose the following model. In unperturbed cancer cells,
RUNX2 expression is sustained by ENH3 that stimulates the
transcriptional activity of the otherwise inert P2 promoter. When
cells are exposed to HDACi, these drugs alter the formation of the
transcriptional complex on ENH3, likely by changing the acetylation status of one or more of its components, thus shortcutting
the ENH3 effect on the P2 promoter and abolishing RUNX2
expression (Fig. 5C). Indeed, when we silenced c-JUN using
speciﬁc siRNAs, we observed a signiﬁcant reduction of RUNX2
levels in both TPC and BCPAP cells, demonstrating that c-JUN is a
positive regulator of RUNX2 expression (Fig. 5D). This observation strongly supports the proposed model. However, we cannot
exclude that additional mechanisms may impinge on the HDACimediated effect on ENH3.
HDAC6 contributed to ENH3 activity and to RUNX2 expression
regulation
Recently, a functional link between HDAC6 and RUNX2 in
cancer cells has been proposed (41). To assess the possibility
that HDAC6 controls RUNX2 expression in cancer cells, we
treated TPC1 and BCPAP cells with increasing amounts of
tubacin, which is a selective inhibitor of HDAC6. Tubacin
strongly repressed RUNX2 expression in TPC1 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. In contrast, this drug had only minimal effect on RUNX2 levels in BCPAP cells (Fig. 6A and B). We
conﬁrmed this observation by siRNA-mediated inhibition of
HDAC6 expression. As expected, anti-HDAC6 siRNA determined a profound reduction of RUNX2 expression in TPC1
cells, but not in BCPAP cells, conﬁrming the results obtained
with the chemical inhibitor (Fig. 6C and D). In order to
measure the effect of HDAC6 knockdown on the activity of
the ENH3, we performed luciferase assay in TPC1 and BCPAP
cells transfected with anti-HDAC6 siRNA or control siRNA.
Indeed, while in BCPAP cells no effect was detected, in TPC1
cells, the siRNA-mediated HDAC6 inhibition resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of the transcriptional activity of both the
full-length ENH3 and the ENH3.C3 fragment, indicating that
HDAC6 participates to the regulation of the transcriptional
complex controlling ENH3 (Fig. 6E and F). However, ChIP
experiments using anti-HDAC6 antibodies failed to detect
HDAC6 on either the RUNX2 P2 promoter or the ENH3,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting that this deacetylase controls RUNX2 expression
without physically interacting with its regulatory regions (data
not shown). These observations demonstrate for the ﬁrst time
that HDCA6 has a function in controlling RUNX2 expression in
thyroid cancer cells and that its inhibition accounts for most of
the repressive effect of the HDACi in TPC1 cells. However, these
data also point toward the existence of cell-speciﬁc mechanisms, involving other HDACs, in controlling RUNX2 expression. The different sensitivity of TPC1 and BCPAP to HDAC6
inhibition was conﬁrmed by proliferation assay (Fig. 6G and
H). Tubacin induced a complete growth arrest in TPC1 cells,
which was already detectable after 24 hours. In contrast, this
drug determined only a partial reduction of the proliferation
rate in BCPAP cells. Meanwhile, TSA determined a strong cell
death effect in both cell lines.
Inhibition of ENH3 activity is a general mechanism of action of
HDACi in different types of cancer
Besides thyroid cancer, RUNX2 has also been proposed to
sustain progression in other types of cancer. Thus, we investigated
the HDACi effect on RUNX2 expression in 10 cancer cell lines
from different tumors. In six cell lines (A549, H1299, MCF7,
MDA-MB-231, PC3, and SAOS2), the TSA treatment determined a
signiﬁcant repression of RUNX2 expression (>1.5-fold; Fig. 7A).
Comparable results were obtained with SAHA (data not shown).
Recent evidence indicates that the cytotoxic effect of HDACi on
cancer cells is also mediated by the repression of highly expressed
oncogenes. Thus, we analyzed whether the degree of HDACimediated RUNX2 repression was associated with the basal level of
RUNX2 expression in cancer cells (Fig. 7B). Regression analysis
showed a striking correlation between the expression levels of
RUNX2 and the strength of TSA-repressing effect. This observation
suggests that the HDACi-mediated RUNX2 repression takes place
only in those tumors in which this transcription factor is highly
expressed. Finally, we tested whether the TSA-repressive effect was
mediated by repression of ENH3 as we have shown in thyroid
cancer cells. In all cell lines tested, the presence of ENH3 downstream of the sP2 promoter determined the activation of the
reporter gene as already observed in TPC1 and BCPAP cells (Fig.
7C). Similarly, upon TSA treatment, the ENH3 activity was
repressed in all cell lines, suggesting the possibility to extend to
other cancer types the model of ENH3 functioning that we
proposed in thyroid cancer.

Discussion
Tumor development and progression are the consequence of
the deregulation of many pathways, which are usually orchestrated by the aberrant function of transcription factors. RUNX2
has been described as driver of aggressiveness and major
determinant of metastatic spreading in cancer (1, 3–
7, 9, 12, 13, 16). However, the regulatory mechanisms that
lead to RUNX2 reactivation during cancer development and
progression are still to be unraveled. In this respect, this study
provides a completely new model of RUNX2 regulation and
opens new perspectives. We have shown that the P2 promoter,
which is responsible for the expression of the major RUNX2
isoform in cancer, is not sufﬁcient to drive RUNX2 expression.
This observation is in agreement with other articles, which
investigated the function of RUNX2 promoters and described a
highly regulated P1 promoter and a rather constitutive P2

HDACi Repress RUNX2 Expression in Tumor Cells

promoter with a constant basal activity, which is not altered by
the presence of regulatory stimuli (24, 28–30). Our results
demonstrate that the major transcriptional activity resides in a
newly identiﬁed enhancer element, located in an intronic
region of the RUNX2 gene, which is able to enhance the
activity of the P2 promoter and to respond to external regulatory stimuli. Our data indicate that this element is active in
several types of tumors in which RUNX2 is overexpressed. It is
known that the expression of genes involved in critical processes is extremely reﬁned and it may be regulated by the
precise spatiotemporal activation of multiple regulatory elements. Thus, it is likely that, besides ENH3, other elements
may contribute to the complicate regulation of RUNX2
expression.
Being the point of convergence of multiple oncogenic processes, RUNX2 appears to be a promising target for developing
therapeutic strategies to counteract tumor progression. However,
targeting transcription factors in cancer has been proven to be
extremely challenging (42). In this study, we demonstrated for the
ﬁrst time that the HDACi strongly repress the expression of
RUNX2 in cancer cells, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy
to counteract the prooncogenic effect of this factor in cancer
patients.
To our knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst works describing the
effect of HDACi on RUNX2 expression in cancer. Nevertheless,
our observations appear to be in contrast with previous works in
which a positive effect of these drugs on RUNX2 expression was
reported in skeletal cells (43, 44). Currently, there are no experimental data to explain such discrepancy, but the different cellular
context is likely to play a relevant role. In bone and cartilage cells,
both RUNX2 isoforms are expressed, whereas in cancer, only
isoform I is observed. It is possible that the increased expression
of RUNX2 detected upon HDACi treatment in skeletal cells is the
result of a combinatory effect on the expression of both isoforms.
It is also reasonable to suppose that in a nontumoral context, such
as the skeletal tissue, the ENH3 is not active and RUNX2 expression is under the control of different elements on which HDACi
exert a different regulation.
One of the major effects of HDACi on cancer cells is the
remodeling of chromatin, which usually leads to the reexpression
of epigenetically silenced oncosuppressor. For many years, this
has been considered as the main mechanism of action of these
drugs as anticancer therapies (31). Reversible acetylation is a
widespread phenomenon that affects many signaling pathways

and thereby many cellular processes. The growing number of
identiﬁed acetylable targets beyond chromatin provides a whole
new world of potential regulatory effects of these drugs, even
though most of these are likely to converge on controlling gene
expression (32). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that HDACi
treatment induces expression changes in 2% to 10% of all human
genes with almost an equal amount of induced and repressed
genes (45, 46). This effect cannot be explained without taking into
consideration the role of HDACi as ﬁne modulators of transcription through modiﬁcation of nonhistonic proteins. We observed
that treatment with HDACi abolishes the formation of a protein
complex on the ENH3 core, thus abrogating its activating effect on
the P2 promoter. We mapped a bipartite binding site, in the ENH3
core, in which three families of transcription factors are predicted
to bind. The ETS family and the Rel family, would bind to site 1,
making complex with AP1, which is predicted to bind site 2. All
these factors have been implicated in cancer progression, in line
with our data that suggest their possible role in supporting the
expression of the prooncogenic factor RUNX2. Noteworthy, the
ability of AP1 to form transcriptional complexes with members of
both ETS and NFAT families is well established, and all these
factors have been shown to be directly or indirectly controlled by
HDACs (47, 48).
We also demonstrated that c-JUN, component of the AP1
complex physically interacts with ENH3 and is a positive regulator
of RUNX2 expression. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report
describing a direct link between c-JUN activity and RUNX2
expression. Acetylation changes the electrostatic state of lysine
from positive to neutral, thus reducing the afﬁnity for negatively
charged molecules like DNA. Similarly, acetylation of lysine
residues can create new dock sites for protein–protein interaction.
Therefore, it is likely that changes in the acetylation proﬁle of one
or more of the factors of the transcriptional complex binding the
ENH3 affect the afﬁnity of the interactions disassembling the
complex. Previous studies have shown that c-JUN is acetylated
and that its acetylation status affects transcriptional activity. Vries
and colleagues (49, 50) observed that the hyperacetylation of
Lys271 of c-JUN is necessary for the repression of the collagenase
promoter in the presence of the E1A protein.
Many HDACs have been shown to bind to RUNX2 and to
control its transcriptional activity. Of these, HDAC6 is the only
HDAC that has been described to cooperate with RUNX2 and
mediate its prooncogenic role in cancer (41). In this work, we
demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that HDAC6 is required for the

resulted in the repression of the ENH3 activity and of RUNX2
levels. This observation implies the existence of an additional
level of positive regulation of HDAC6 on RUNX2 in cancer
cells, besides the functional cooperation between these two
proteins.
We have shown that the inhibitory effect of HDACi on RUNX2
expression is not restricted to thyroid cancer cells but is common

to other cancer types in which RUNX2 has been implicated. We
have also shown that the mechanism through which this inhibition takes place is similar in all cell lines tested and involves the
inhibition of ENH3 transcription activity. In contrast, the observation that HDAC6 inhibition does not affect expression of
RUNX2 in BCPAP seems to suggest that different HDACs may
contribute to this regulation depending on the cellular context or
on the genetic background of the tumors.
