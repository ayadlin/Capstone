Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Germinal center (GC) B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) is a common
malignancy yet the signaling pathways deregulated and the factors leading to its systemic
dissemination are poorly defined1,2. Work in mice showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor-2 (S1PR2), a Gα12 and Gα13 coupled receptor, promotes growth regulation and local
confinement of GC B cells3,4. Recent GCB-DLBCL deep sequencing studies have revealed
mutations in a large number of genes in this cancer, including in GNA13 (encoding Gα13) and
S1PR25-7. Here we show using in vitro and in vivo assays that GCB-DLBCL associated mutations
occurring in S1PR2 frequently disrupt the receptor's Akt and migration inhibitory functions.
Gα13-deficient mouse GC B cells and human GCB-DLBCL cells were unable to suppress pAkt
and migration in response to S1P, and Gα13-deficient mice developed GC B cell-derived
lymphoma. GC B cells, unlike most lymphocytes, are tightly confined in lymphoid organs and do
not recirculate. Remarkably, deficiency in Gα13, but not S1PR2, led to GC B cell dissemination
into lymph and blood. GCB-DLBCL cell lines frequently carried mutations in the Gα13 effector
ARHGEF1, and Arhgef1-deficiency also led to GC B cell dissemination. The incomplete
phenocopy of Gα13- and S1PR2-deficiency led us to discover that P2RY8, an orphan receptor that
is mutated in GCB-DLBCL and another GC B cell-derived malignancy, Burkitt lymphoma (BL),
also represses GC B cell growth and promotes confinement via Gα13. These findings identify a
Gα13-dependent pathway that exerts dual actions in suppressing growth and blocking
dissemination of GC B cells that is frequently disrupted in GC B cell-derived lymphoma.

We sequenced the S1PR2 coding region in 117 GCB-DLBCL, 31 BL and 68 activated B
cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL samples. Twelve S1PR2 coding mutations were identified in the
GCB-DLBCL samples versus one in each of the BL and ABC-DLBCL cohorts
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The majority of GCB-DLBCL mutations were in
conserved transmembrane (TM) residues (Fig. 1a) and all were predicted to be structurally
damaging. Cell line transduction experiments showed that 5 of 8 tested mutations disrupted
S1PR2 protein expression (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a-c).
These same mutations disrupted S1P-mediated inhibition of CXCL12-induced pAkt and
migration (Fig. 1c, d). One additional mutant, R147C, which was expressed at levels similar
to wild-type (WT) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1), showed a strongly reduced ability to
support S1P-mediated inhibition of pAkt and migration (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data Fig.
1d, e). These observations suggested that tumors harboring single mutant S1PR2 alleles

(Extended Data Fig. 2) are often likely to be functionally heterozygous for S1PR2. Using a
mixed BM chimera system in mice3, S1pr2 heterozygous B cells showed marked expansion
in the GC relative to the follicular compartment in mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and
Peyer's patches (PPs) of unimmunized mice (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Overexpression of WT S1PR2 repressed the outgrowth of S1pr2+/- GC B cells and this was also
seen for mutant R329C, whereas the R147C mutation caused the receptor to lose GC growth
suppressive activity (Fig. 1 f and Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). Based on molecular simulation
analysis (Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 3e-g) we propose that the R147C
S1PR2 mutant cannot attain the active conformation necessary for G-protein recruitment and
signaling.

Gα12 and Gα13 often function redundantly in transmitting GPCR signals8. Transcripts for
both G-proteins are upregulated in GC B cells, with Gna13 transcripts appearing more
abundant (Extended Data Fig. 4a). In accord with recent whole exome sequencing studies
that reported mutations in GNA13 but not GNA125,6,9-11, we found frequent GNA13 coding
mutations in GCB-DLBCL and BL biopsy samples, with a number of biallelic cases
(Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Mixed BM chimera analysis revealed
that Gα13-deficiency was sufficient to confer a GC B cell growth advantage in mLNs and to
a lesser extent in PPs (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Gα13-deficient mLN GC B cells
showed increased pAkt relative to WT when incubated ex vivo with CXCL12 and S1P (Fig.
1h). Deficiency in the Gα13 effector, Arhgef1 (p115 RhoGEF or Lsc), led to a similar defect
in the ability of S1P to repress chemokine induced pAkt (Fig. 1i).

To determine whether loss of Gα13 in B cells could promote lymphomagenesis, we allowed
a cohort of Gna13-deficient mice to age. At one year, 10 of 18 Gna13-deficient mice
showed a greater than 10-fold expansion of GC B cells compared to littermate controls (Fig.
1j, k) and at least five of the outgrowths appeared clonal (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Three of
the Gna13-deficient animals showed massive mesenteric lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1l and not
shown), with evidence in one case (#307) of spleen and PP involvement (Fig. 1l and
Extended Data Fig. 4c-e). Immunophenotyping of the Gα13-deficient tumors confirmed
they were of GC origin (Extended Data Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

To test the conservation of the Gα13-signaling pathway in human GC B cells, we performed
gene rescue experiments in GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Sequencing of S1PR2, GNA13 and
ARHGEF1 in a panel of GCB-DLBCL cell lines identified several with deleterious
mutations in these genes (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The mutations
in GNA13 matched those previously described and were associated with reduced protein
levels6. ARHGEF1 mutations have not previously been reported, likely because the large
size (∼24 kb) of this 27 exon gene and its multiple splice variants and low transcript
abundance make sequence analysis difficult. Remarkably, 10 of 20 cell lines with analyzable
ARHGEF1 sequence showed mutations in this gene, several of which resulted in premature
stop codons (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Using retroviral
transduction to restore gene expression, we established that loss of S1PR2, Gα13 and
ARHGEF1 were each sufficient to disrupt S1P-mediated suppression of pAKT and, in the
case of cell lines that were migratory, to disrupt S1P-mediated inhibition of migration (See
Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 5).

The mechanisms by which malignant GC B cells can exit the GC niche and lymphoid organ
to spread amongst multiple LNs or to systemic sites such as BM have not been defined.
Consistent with a lack of migration inhibition by S1P (Fig. 2a), mice lacking Gα13 in B
cells showed marked disruption of GC architecture in mLNs (Fig. 2b and Extended Data
Fig. 6a). In a mixed transfer system, Gα13-deficient GC B cells were excluded from the
interior of otherwise wild-type GCs (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Remarkably, Gα13-deficient
GC B cells were readily detected in lymph and to a lesser extent in blood while WT GC B
cells were absent from circulation (Fig. 2c). In mixed BM chimeras, Gα13-deficient GC B
cells were again detectable in the lymph, indicating that Gα13 was needed intrinsically in
GC B cells to inhibit egress (Fig. 2d). Analysis of Arhgef1-deficient mice and chimeras
revealed a similar disruption of mLN GC architecture (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 6c)
and GC B cell appearance in lymph and blood (Fig. 2e, f). In contrast, S1PR2-deficient GC
B cells were not significantly higher in lymph relative to littermate controls (Fig. 2g).
Analysis of mice expressing constitutively active myr-Akt or over-expressing BCL2 in B
cells established that increased GC B cell survival was not sufficient to lead to dissemination
(Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 7).
GNA13 mutations and BCL2 rearrangements and potentially activating mutations frequently
occur together in GCB-DLBCL6,12. GC B cells in mice with combined Gα13-deficiency and
BCL2 overexpression showed enhanced ex vivo survival (Fig. 3a), increased numbers (Fig.
3b), wider dispersal throughout the follicle and interfollicular regions in mLNs (Extended
Data Fig. 7f) and 2-fold increased frequencies in lymph and blood (compare Fig. 3c and 2c),
compared to cells in Gα13-deficient mice

To examine requirements for GC B cell persistence after arriving at a distant site we
bypassed the egress step and intravenously transferred mLN cells to congenically distinct
recipients. Transferred WT GC B cells were essentially undetectable in recipient spleen and
BM after six hours (Fig. 3d, e) and Gα13-deficiency alone was insufficient to cause a
significant increase in their number (Fig. 3e). Bcl2-overexpression alone caused an elevation
in GC B cell frequency in recipient spleens but not BM (Fig. 3e). Loss of Gα13 combined
with Bcl2-overexpression led to greater accumulation of transferred GC B cells in spleen
and now led to an increase in their frequency in BM (Fig. 3e). This combinatorial effect
likely reflects an ability of Gα13-deficiency and BCL2-overexpression to cooperate in
promoting survival of GC B cells outside the GC niche (Fig. 3a). To determine whether GC
B cells could seed distant LNs after entry into lymphatics, we transferred mLN cells
intraperitoneally. Small numbers of Gα13-deficient, but not WT, GC B cells were detectable
in the draining parathymic LNs after six hours (Fig. 3f). In this case, recovery of Gα13deficient GC B cells was not enhanced by the BCL2 transgene. BM involvement occurs in a
fraction of GCB-DLBCL patients and is a predictor of worse disease13. In some year old
Gα13-deficient mice showing mLN tumors, GC B cells could be detected in the BM (Fig.
3g, h). Moreover, in aged BCL2-tg Gna13 KO but not BCL2-tg Gna13 WT mice, GC B cells
were frequently found in the BM (Fig. 3i).
The more frequent mutations of GNA13 than of S1PR2 in both GCB-DLBCL and BL
despite the similar size of their open reading frames, together with our finding of Gna13deficient but not S1pr2-deficient mouse GC B cells in circulation (Fig. 2c and g) led us to

hypothesize that additional Gα13 coupled GPCRs may be involved in GC B cell regulation.
In this regard, P2YR8, a gene situated in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome,
was a target of mutations in published whole exome sequencing data of GCB-DLBCL and
BL5,7,14 and was frequently mutated in our GCB-DLBCL and BL samples, with several of
each lymphoma type carrying biallelic mutations (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 2 and
Extended Data Fig. 2). P2RY8 is an orphan receptor and has orthologs in many vertebrates,
but unexpectedly it lacks an ortholog in mouse (Fig. 4b). Like S1PR2, P2RY8 was abundant
in human GC B cells (Fig. 4c). Five out of six tested mutations prevented surface P2RY8
expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b).

Despite the lack of a mouse P2RY8 ortholog, we considered the possibility that if the ligand
were a small molecule it may be conserved and we therefore asked whether P2RY8
overexpression influenced GC B cell growth. Remarkably, human P2RY8 led to a
suppressive effect on GC B cell growth in mouse PPs and mLNs, similar to the effect of
S1PR2 overexpression (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c). This suppression required
P2RY8 coupling to Gα13 as it was not seen if the cells lacked Gna13 (Fig. 4e and Extended
Data Fig. 8d). In short-term transfers, P2RY8-transduced B cells localized in the center of
the follicle immediately around and often within GCs while vector transduced cells were
dispersed throughout the follicle (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 8e, f and Supplementary Text).
In the absence of Gα13, P2RY8 was unable to direct B cells to the follicle center (Fig. 4g
and Extended Data Fig. 8g). Importantly, a control Gα13 coupled GPCR, Tbxa2r, could not
suppress GC B cell growth or confine cells to the GC niche (Extended Data Fig. 9 and
Supplementary Text). These observations lead us to suggest that P2RY8 in humans acts to
suppress GC B cell growth and promote B cell positioning in a GC location via Gα13dependent pathways.

GC B cells are normally tightly regulated in their growth and strictly confined to the GC,
and they lack the ability to exit into circulation or to survive outside the GC niche. Each of
these processes breaks down in the GC B cell-derived malignancies, GCB-DLBCL and BL.
We provide evidence that disruption of Gα13 signaling, via mutations in GNA13,
ARHGEF1, S1PR2 or P2RY8, contributes to this breakdown. GNA13 is mutated in 15-33%
of GCB-DLBCL and ∼15% of BL6,7,9-11 (Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig.
2). This is similar to the frequency of mutations in the histone methyltransferases EZH2 and
MLL2, deletions of PTEN and amplifications of miR17-92, genetic alterations that have been
highlighted for their role in oncogenesis in GCB-DLBCL15-21. Our data support a model
(Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplemental text) where deleterious mutations in Gα13 and its
effector, ARHGEF1, are sufficient to deregulate AKT signaling and to cause loss of
confinement, allowing egress of GC B cells into circulation; survival of the disseminating
cells at distant sites such as BM depends on cooperating mutations affecting additional
genes, such as BCL212,22. S1PR2 and P2RY8 mutations are also suggested to deregulate
AKT signaling and growth but may lead to less dissemination due to overlapping roles in
promoting confinement. Potentially inactivating mutations of RHOA, a direct target of
ARHGEF123, have been reported in BL24. The mechanism by which RHOA inhibits AKT
activation is not yet defined but might involve activation of PTEN or inhibition of
RAC25-27. We suggest that small molecules that inhibit AKT may replace the missing

repressive effects of RHO on growth or survival in cells that harbor defects in the S1PR2/
P2RY8-GNA13-ARHGEF1-RHO pathway. Development of active RHO-mimetics may
represent a novel therapeutic approach that addresses both lymphoma cell survival and
disease dissemination.

Methods
Human samples and Sequencing

Author Manuscript

All clinical samples were studied with informed consent according to an IRB protocol
approved by the National Cancer Institute. Genomic DNA for the single exon coding region
of S1PR2 and cDNA for GNA13 or ARHGEF1 was PCR amplified. PCR products were
bidirectionally sequenced using an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence electropherograms were manually reviewed. ARHGEF1 encodes multiple splice
variants with up to 28 coding exons per splice variant. We were unable to sequence the open
reading frame of ARHGEF1 from cDNA in some cell lines in our panel likely due to splice
variation or insufficient transcript. In some cell lines, regions containing coding exons for
ARHGEF1 were amplified from genomic DNA. Primers used for amplification and
sequencing are shown in Supplementary Table 4. The following NCBI (RefSeq) accession
numbers: ARHGEF1: NM_004706 and NP_004697, GNA13: NM_006572 and NP_006563,
S1PR2: NM_004230 and NP_004221 were used to report mutations.
Mice and BM chimeras

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Adult C57BL6 Ly5.2 (CD45.1+) mice at least 7 weeks of age were from the National Cancer
Institute. S1pr2−/− mice28 were backcrossed for at least six generations to C57BL6/J (B6/J).
Arhgef1−/− mice29 were backcrossed to B6/J for at least 6 generations. Gna13 f/f mice were
on a mixed background30. Mb1-cre mice (provided by M. Reth) express Cre in all B-lineage
cells31. BCL2-tg mice were of the EμBcl2-22 line32 that overexpresses BCL2 selectively in
B cells. MD4 Ig-tg mice were from an internal colony. Mice lacking Gna13 in B cells and
littermate controls were generated by crossing mb1-cre + Gna13 f/+ mice to Gna13 f/f. In
most experiments, bred mice of both sexes were used and were between 7 and 12 weeks of
age except in the aging cohort of Gna13 animals as indicated. BM chimeras were made
using Ly5.2 (CD45.1+) from NCI as hosts as previously described33 and analyzed at least 8
weeks after reconstitution. For one experiment using S1pr2 heterozygous and WT littermate
donors, mice were also heterozygous for beta-2-microglobulin. CD21-cre (Cr2-cre) mice
that express Cre in mature B cells were from Jackson Laboratories. The mouse genotype
was not blinded from the investigator and mice were not randomized. Mice were housed in a
specific pathogen–free environment in the Laboratory Animal Research Center at the
University of California, San Francisco, and all animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Retroviral constructs and transductions
S1PR2, P2RY8, GNA13, ARHGEF1 retroviral constructs were made by inserting the
human open reading frame into the MSCV2.2 retroviral vector followed by an internal
ribosome entry site (IRES) and Thy1.1 or GFP as an expression marker. The mouse Tbxa2r
open reading frame was inserted into the Thy1.1 MSCV2.2 retroviral vector. S1PR2, P2RY8

and Tbxa2r were inserted in frame with a preprolactin leader and FLAG-epitope encoding
sequence. Lymphoma-associated mutations were introduced into S1PR2 or P2RY8 by
quick-change PCR. WEHI231 or human lymphoma cell lines engineered to express an
ecotropic retroviral receptor34 were spin-infected with retrovirus containing vector, WT or
mutant S1PR2, P2RY8, Tbxa2r, GNA13 or ARHGEF1. For transduction of BM, S1pr2
heterozygous or deficient, CD21-cre or Gna13 f/f mb1-cre donor mice were injected IV with
3 mg 5-fluorouracil (Sigma). BM was collected after 4 d and was cultured in DMEM
containing 15% (vol/vol) FBS, antibiotics (penicillin(50 IU/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/
ml); Cellgro) and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (Cellgro), supplemented with IL-3, IL-6 and stem
cell factor (at concentrations of 20, 50 or 100 ng/ml, respectively; Peprotech). Cells were
‘spin-infected’ twice at days 1 and 2 and were transferred into irradiated recipients on day 3.
BM chimeras in which constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) is selectively
expressed in B cells were generated by transducing CD21-cre BM with retrovirus in which
myr-Akt is downstream of a loxP-stop-loxP cassette3. To generate activated B cells that can
be efficiently retrovirally transduced, MD4 Ig-transgenic mice (MGI 2384500) containing
lysozyme-specific B cells were injected with 5 mg hen egg lysozyme (HEL), splenocytes
were harvested 4 hours later and the B cells further activated by culturing with 20 μg/ml
anti-CD40 (FGK4.5; BioXcell) for 24 hours as in past studies35. Alternatively, Gpr183+/or Gna13 WT or KO spleen cells were harvested in media containing 1 μg/ml LPS or 0.25
μg/ml anti-CD180 (RP-105; clone RP14, BD Biosciences) and cultured for 24 hours. Later
experiments were performed using anti-CD180 activation as we found it much more
effective in achieving high levels of transduction than LPS. The activated B cells were spininfected for 2 hours with retroviral supernatant, and cultured overnight before transfer into
SRBC-immunized wild-type mice. Transferred cells were analyzed after 24 hours by flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry.

B cells from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), Peyer's patches (PPs) and blood were
isolated and stained as previously described3. Lymph was collected from the cysterna chyli
via fine glass micropipette as previously described36. Assessment of clonality by PCR of
J558 heavy chain, and κ and λ light chains from genomic DNA from bulk mLN cells from
year old mice was performed as previously described37. For adoptive transfer experiments,
mLN were harvested, washed once and transferred IV or IP into CD45.1 recipient mice.
Spleen and BM were harvested 6 h after IV transfer, parathymic LNs were harvested 6 h
after IP transfer. Harvested organs were analyzed by FACS for the presence of donor GC B
cells. For GC B cell positioning experiments in a mixed setting, Gna13 WT or KO CD45.2+
B cells were transferred with WT CD45.1+ B cells into MD4 Ig-tg CD45.1+ recipients.
Recipients were then immunized with SRBCs and analyzed after 8 days. For pAkt analysis
of mLN GC B cells, mLN were harvested in RPM-I1640 medium containing 0.5% (wt/vol)
fatty acid-free BSA (migration media; EMD Biosciences). Cells were RBC lysed twice and
resuspended in migration media. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C and then
stimulated for 10 min with CXCL12 (300 ng/ml) or S1P (10 nM). Cells were fixed at a final
concentration of 1.5% PFA for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in icecold methanol. Cells were washed twice in staining buffer, blocked with Fc-block (2.4G2;

room temp for Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (D9E, #4060; Cell Signaling Technology)
followed by goat antibody to rabbit IgG conjugated to allophycocyanin (sc-3846; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) as well as antibodies to GC markers. For pAkt analysis by flow cytometry in
transduced WEHI231 or human GCB-DLBCL lines, cells were stimulated for five minutes
with or without CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) with or without S1P (1 nM for WEHI-231 or 10 nM
for human GCB-DLBCL lines) and fixed and stained as above for pAkt as well as antiThy1.1 conjugated to phycoerythrin (clone ox-7; Biolegend). Human cell lines used in this
manuscript were tested for mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma positive lines were
treated with MycoZap (Lonza) and Plasmocin (InvivoGen). All human cell lines were tested
for a unique profile of polymorphic DNA copy number variants (CNV fingerprint;
unpublished protocol from L. Bergsagel). In some experiments, cells were treated with the
PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (Sigma) or GS-1101 (Selleck Chemicals) as negative pAkt
staining controls. For active caspase-3 staining, total mLN cells were harvested, washed
once and incubated in RPMI-I1640 containing 10% FCS for 3h at 37, cells were stained for
surface markers, fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and stained with antiactive Caspase-3 conjugated to biotin (clone: C92-605; BD Biosciences) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Chemotaxis assays of GC B cells were performed using total
mLN cells that were RBC lysed twice or transduced WEHI231 or human GCB-DLBCL
lines as described3. U-46619 was from Cayman Chemicals. Flow cytometry was performed
on a FACSCalibur or LSRii (BD Biosciences). For qPCR analysis of gene expression in GC
B cells, Ptprc (encoding CD45) was used as a control since its expression was unchanged
between Fo and GC B cells by microarray (Immgen.org and unpublished data), RNAseq
analysis (unpublished) and by surface staining. In contrast, Gapdh and Hprt were both
upregulated in GC B cells (Immgen.org and unpublished data).

Western Blotting
WEHI231 cells transduced with vector, WT or mutant human S1PR2 were washed twice in
migration media and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, washed once in cold PBS and lysed
in 0.5% Brij 35, 0.5% NP40, 150mM NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche) for 1 hour on ice. Lysate were centrifuged and supernatant were mixed
with loading buffer and reducing agent and incubated at room temp for 30 min. Samples
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and FLAG expression was detected with rabbit polyclonal
anti-FLAG (Sigma). For pAkt western blot experiments Ly7, Ly8 or WEHI cells that were
sorted based on Thy1.1 expression and expanded were stimulated as above and lysed in 2×
sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with rabbit anti-pAkt S473 (D9E,

sc-6059) or biotinylated anti-mouse CD138 (clone 281-2; BD Biosciences). For Bcl-6
staining, cryosections were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes and stained with rabbit
polyclonal Bcl6 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-368). Images were captured with a Zeiss
AxioOberver Z1 inverted microscope.

The hydrogen bond network tightens the interactions between transmembrane helices TM3
and TM4. We hypothesize that this network stabilizes the putative active state conformation
of S1PR2. Such a network is broken in the R147C mutant and hence this mutant does not
activate the G-protein.

Figure 2. Loss of confinement and systemic dissemination of GC B cells in the absence of Gα13
or Arhgef1

Author Manuscript

(a) Transwell migration of mLN GC B cells from Gna13 WT (f/+) or Gna13 KO (f/f mb1cre) mice to CXCL12 (300 ng/ml) or CXCL13 (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of S1P
(10 nM). Data are shown as mean +/-SEM and are pooled from 5 independent experiments
with 2 technical replicates in each experiment. (b) Immunohistochemical analysis of mLNs
from Gna13 or Arhgef1 WT or KO mice stained to detect GC B cells (GL7, blue) and naïve
follicular B cells (IgD, brown). Scale bar is 100 μm. Data are representative of at least 4
mLNs of each type. (c-g) Lymph and/or blood from Gna13 WT (n=13 for lymph; n=17 for
blood) or KO (n=10 for lymph; n=12 for blood) animals (c), Gna13 mixed chimeras (WT,
n=5; KO, n=6) (d), Arhgef1 WT (n=7) or KO (n=6) animals (e), Arhgef1 mixed chimeras
(WT, n=6; KO, n=5) (f) or S1pr2 heterozygous (n=5) or KO (n=5) animals (g) was analyzed
for the presence of GC B cells by FACS. Representative FACS plot for GC B cells in lymph
is shown in c with percent of total cells that are GC B cells indicated. Data are shown as GC
B cell frequency amongst total cells in lymph and as cells per ml in blood. Data in c-g are
pooled from between 3 and 13 independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.

(a) Intracellular FACS for active caspase-3 in GC B cells from non-BCL2-tg or BCL2-tg
Gna13 WT or KO mLN cells incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. (b) GC B cell numbers in
mLNs from Gna13 KO or control (Gna13 WT or Het) mice with or without the BCL2-tg,
determined by FACS. n=17, 11, 12 and 8, respectively. (c) GC B cells in lymph and blood
of BCL2-tg (lymph, n=9; blood, n=13) or BCL2-tg Gna13 KO (lymph, n=9; blood, n=9)
mice. (d-f) mLN cells from non-BCL2-tg or BCL2-tg Gna13 WT or KO CD45.2 mice were
transferred intravenously (d and e, n=8, 6, 7 and 7 for spleen and n=5, 3, 7, 7 for BM,
respectively) or intraperitoneally (f, n=4, 4, 3 and 4, respectively) into CD45.1 recipients.
Spleen and BM (d and e) or parathymic LNs (f) of recipients were harvested after 6 hours
and analyzed for the presence of donor GC B cells. Percent of donor B cells that were GC B
cells are shown in d. Ratios of percent donor GC B cells recovered from spleen and BM (e)
or parathymic LNs (f) divided by percent GC B cells in input is shown. (g-i) Bone marrow
of Gna13 WT and heterozygous (n=16) or KO (n=14) aged to between 12 and 16 months (g,
h) or BCL2-tg Gna13 WT (n=6) or KO (n=5) aged to 10 months (i) was analyzed for GC B
cells by FACS. Data a-c, e, f, h and i are pooled from between 3 and 13 independent
experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.
