Abstract
PARP-1 is a nuclear protein that has important roles in maintenance of genomic integrity. During genotoxic
stress, PARP-1 recruits to sites of DNA damage where PARP-1 domain architecture initiates catalytic activation
and subsequent poly(ADP-ribose)–dependent DNA repair. PARP-1 inhibition is a promising new way to
selectively target cancers harboring DNA repair deﬁciencies. However, current inhibitors target other PARPs,
raising important questions about long-term off-target effects. Here, we propose a new strategy that targets PARP1 allosteric regulation as a selective way of inhibiting PARP-1. We found that disruption of PARP-1 domain–
domain contacts through mutagenesis held no cellular consequences on recruitment to DNA damage or a model
system of transcriptional regulation, but prevented DNA-damage–dependent catalytic activation. Furthermore,
PARP-1 mutant overexpression in a pancreatic cancer cell line (MIA PaCa-2) increased sensitivity to platinumbased anticancer agents. These results not only highlight the potential of a synergistic drug combination of
allosteric PARP inhibitors with DNA-damaging agents in genomically unstable cancer cells (regardless of
homologous recombination status), but also signify important applications of selective PARP-1 inhibition.
Finally, the development of a high-throughput PARP-1 assay is described as a tool to promote discovery of novel
PARP-1 selective inhibitors. Cancer Res; 74(1); 31–37. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
PARP-1 is a multidomain protein related to 16 other members of a family possessing ADP-ribosyl transferase catalytic
domains with similar enzymatic and structural features (1).
PARP-1 has multiple cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, cell death signaling, and DNA damage repair.
PARP-1 has recently garnered attention as a therapeutic target
in lethal malignancies such as pancreatic cancer (2).
PARP-1 has six domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminus contains
three zinc-binding domains: Zn1, Zn2, and Zn3. Zn1 and Zn2
bind to altered DNA structures (3), whereas Zn3 contains a
structurally unique "zinc ribbon" fold that contributes to PARP1 DNA damage–dependent activation through domain–
domain contacts (4, 5). The central automodiﬁcation domain

contains a BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) fold, and serves as a
major site of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) modiﬁcation. Toward the
C-terminus, the Tryptophan-Glycine-Arginine (WGR) domain
makes DNA and protein contacts that are important for
catalytic activation (6, 7). The C-terminal catalytic region
contains the active site where NADþ is consumed to synthesize
PAR covalently modiﬁed onto nuclear targets such as PARP-1
itself (8). Under genotoxic stress, PARP-1 domains assemble on
DNA damage and form a network of domain–domain contacts
that imposes a structural distortion on the catalytic domain
(CAT; ref. 7), leading to a dramatic increase in catalytic activity
(9). This hyperactivation accounts for the majority of PAR
accumulation at sites of DNA damage, leading to recruitment
of repair proteins to facilitate DNA repair (10). PAR formation
facilitates DNA repair under low to moderate levels of genomic
stress, but can trigger cell death mechanisms upon excessive
damage. These important roles of PARP-1 ensure maintenance
of genomic integrity and provide protection from carcinogenesis of badly damaged cells.
Therapeutic strategies targeting PARP-1 have promising
applications for the treatment of some cancers, drawing
considerable attention in recent years (11). PARP-1 inhibitors have been optimized to low nanomolar potency and
show clinical utility when used as a single agent or in
combination therapy to treat cancers with DNA repair
deﬁciencies (12). Although the clinical potential of PARP1 inhibitors looks promising, therapeutic beneﬁt versus
adverse effects stemming from targeting other PARPs is not
well understood. For instance, a study proﬁled the binding of

family members and observed varying degrees of crossselectivity (13). With such a high degree of conservation in
the catalytic active sites of PARPs, it is not surprising that
cross-selectivity exists among small molecules that target
the substrate-binding site.
Toward achieving selective PARP-1 inhibition, we focused
on the PARP-1 domains unique to DNA damage–dependent
activation. The Zn1, Zn3, and WGR domains are essential for
catalytic activation. A recent crystal structure of PARP-1
revealed that these domains assemble into a complex in
the presence of damaged DNA (7). This structure has
opened possibilities of selectively targeting damage-depen-

domain contacts.
Here, we mutated key residues located at the interfaces
between essential PARP-1 domains and observed no major
changes in binding to DNA damage, but severe deﬁciencies in
catalytic activation. A pancreatic cancer cell line carrying these
deﬁciencies in PARP-1 showed an increase in sensitivity to
platinum-based anticancer agents, suggesting a dominant
negative effect that interferes with DNA damage processing.
With prospective therapeutic applications of allosteric PARP-1
inhibition, we present a PARP-1 interdomain communication
assay designed to identify new classes of selective PARP-1
inhibitors.

Allosteric Regulation of PARP-1

Materials and Methods
Gene cloning and mutagenesis
Full-length wild-type (WT) PARP-1 (1-1014) and DZn2 PARP1 (97-206 deleted) were expressed with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (pET-28). Zn1–Zn3 (1-366 with 97-206 deleted) and
WGR-CAT (518-1014) were expressed with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (pET-24). QuickChange mutations (Stratagene)
were veriﬁed by automated sequencing. PARP-1 pcDNA constructs were cloned as described (3). EGFP-PARP-1 was generated by subcloning the Nhe1/Xho1 fragment from pcDNAPARP-1 into pEGFP-N1.
Protein production
PARP-1 proteins were expressed in E. coli and puriﬁed as
described (14).
Transient transfection and immunoﬂuorescent staining
PARP-1/ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were
treated as described (3). To induce DNA damage, H2O2 was
added to the cells for 10 minutes before ﬁxation. Cells were
transfected 24 hours later with 1 mg DNA and 3 mL Fugene
(Promega) in serum-free media following the recommended
protocol.
Live-cell microscopy and laser irradiation
HeLa cells were treated under the same conditions as the
MEFs. Cells were sensitized posttransfection with 1 mmol/L
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in warm phenol-red free media
(Ham's F-12 with 25 mmol/L HEPES pH 8.0, 10% FBS) for
24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 before addition of Hoechst stain (10
mg/mL). Experiments were performed using a Zeiss LSM-510
Meta Confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 405nm diode laser (set to 100% power) to locally irradiate nuclear
sites for 1 second. Images were recorded by excitation with a
488-nm argon laser (set to 10% power) focused through a 63/
1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion lens.
Drug sensitivity assays
Stably transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3)
were seeded at low conﬂuency and incubated at 37 C overnight. Cells were treated with drug and then grown to conﬂuence (5–6 days). Cell viability was assessed by quantiﬁcation of
double-stranded DNA using Quant-iT PicoGreen (Invitrogen).
Gemcitabine was purchased from Lilly. All other drugs were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Fluorescent polarization DNA-binding assay
Reactions were carried out as previously described using an
18-bp DNA duplex (5). For the PARP-1 release experiment, WT
and mutant proteins (200 nmol/L) were ﬁrst incubated with
the DNA duplex (100 nmol/L total DNA, 5% ﬂuorescein labeled)
for 30 minutes before addition of NADþ (5 mmol/L) or H2O.
Polarization was measured over time on a plate reader
(PerkinElmer).
Colorimetric PARP-1 automodiﬁcation assay
This assay measures incorporation of biotinylated-NADþ
into PAR (14).

Androgen receptor reporter assay
Androgen receptor (AR) ligand–induced transcriptional
activity was measured by relative luciferase activity as described
(15).

Results and Discussion
Disruption of PARP-1 domain–domain contacts impairs
catalytic activation without affecting high-afﬁnity
interaction with DNA damage
The essential Zn1, Zn3, and WGR domains each have low
binding afﬁnity for DNA damage, but in combination their
collective afﬁnity increases nearly 100-fold (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The activated PARP-1 structure indicated that each
of these domains forms contacts with DNA that are mutually
compatible and consistent with their high collective DNAbinding afﬁnity. We tested whether the contacts at the interfaces between the domains contributed to the collective
assembly on DNA, thus forming a high-afﬁnity interaction
with DNA. Key residues located at domain interfaces were
mutated (Fig. 1A). Although the mutations had a severe impact
on DNA damage–dependent catalytic activity (Fig. 1C), they
did not affect the overall PARP-1 DNA-binding afﬁnity (Fig.
1D). The Zn2 domain is not essential for DNA-dependent
PARP-1 activity (7); however, Zn2 has high binding afﬁnity
that could potentially mask DNA-binding deﬁciencies of interdomain mutants. Thus, several mutants were tested in a PARP1 construct with Zn2 deleted (DZn2). All mutants tested
retained a high DNA-binding afﬁnity (Supplementary Fig.
S2), indicating that high-afﬁnity binding to DNA mediated by
the assembly of Zn1, Zn3, and WGR is independent from the
allosteric regulation that triggers activation.
Allosteric mutant W318R localizes to sites of DNA
damage, but is defective in damage-induced PAR
synthesis and release from DNA
Cellular tests of PARP-1 function assessed the effect of
disrupting allosteric activation. PARP-1/W318R was compared
with PARP-1/WT, as it showed major deﬁciencies in DNAdependent activation biochemically (Fig. 1C, ref. 5). In the
absence of DNA damage, both localized to the nucleus of
PARP-1/ MEFs and did not produce a notable PAR signal
using indirect immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2A). Upon treatment with H2O2, PAR production was signiﬁcantly increased in
cells positive for the presence of PARP-1/WT but not PARP-1/
W318R, indicating that the cellular deﬁciency of PARP-1/
W318R resembles the biochemical observation. We next tested
the ability of PARP-1/W318R to localize to damage sites. GFPPARP-1 was transfected into HeLa cells. GFP-PARP-1/WT and
GFP-PARP-1/W318R both recruited to DNA damage sites in a
similar manner (Fig. 2B), further supporting that recognition of
damaged DNA is not affected by disruptions in PARP-1 allosteric communication.
DNA-activated PARP-1 consumes NADþ in an automodiﬁcation reaction that results in covalently attached PAR, which
ultimately releases PARP-1 from DNA. PARP-1 inhibitors cause
deﬁciencies in PARP-1 release from DNA (16). Prolonged
residency at DNA damage sites is proposed to contribute to
the genotoxic effect of PARP-1 inhibition, and to the synergistic

effect of combining PARP-1 inhibitors with DNA-damaging
agents. We tested whether interdomain mutants showed deﬁciencies in the mechanism of release from DNA damage. Upon
addition of NADþ, the W318R mutant exhibited a drastic delay
in release kinetics compared with WT (Fig. 2C), similar to that
of catalytic mutant E988A. Other interdomain mutants exhibited delayed release kinetics (Fig. 2C), consistent with their
slower rates of PAR formation (Fig. 1C). Collectively, cell-based
and biochemical analyses indicate that disruption of domain–
domain contacts critical for activation does not inﬂuence
PARP-1 binding to DNA damage, and that the deﬁciency in
DNA damage–dependent activation causes PARP-1 to remain
engaged with DNA in a manner that is not effectively reversed
by automodiﬁcation.
Disruption of PARP-1 allosteric regulation sensitizes
pancreatic cancer cells to platinum-based agents
To determine whether allosteric disruption of PARP-1 catalytic activity could deliver comparable therapeutic potential
as current PARP inhibitors, isogenic MIA PaCa-2 cells overexpressing PARP-1 mutants (Fig. 3B) were treated with a
variety of chemotherapeutic agents following two criteria: (i)
they currently or previously had been part of a chemotherapeutic regimen for pancreatic cancer and (ii) they are classiﬁed
as DNA-damaging agents. PARP-1/WT- and PARP-1/W318Rtransfected cell lines were analyzed, as well as the cell line
bearing the E988A mutation that targets a catalytic active site
residue, and should therefore mimic drugs that target the
catalytic domain. Overexpression of PARP-1/WT had no effect
in combination with chemotherapy (Fig. 3A). However, overexpression of PARP-1/W318R or PARP-1/E988A rendered cells
4 to 8 times more sensitive to platinum-based anticancer
agents (Fig. 3A). Increased sensitivity was not seen in combi-

nation with other chemotherapeutic agents (Supplementary
Fig. S3), indicating a preferential synergistic potential between
PARP-1 inhibition and platinum-based therapies, in line with
current clinical trial outcomes (17). In addition, allosteric
disruption of catalytic activity seems to be equally effective
at sensitizing cells as direct disruption at the catalytic domain.
The molecular mechanisms responsible for sensitization with
platinum agents are not completely understood. However,
sensitization from this combination has been observed in MIA
PaCa-2 cells (18), as well as other cell-based models (19–21),
and is likely cell-type speciﬁc (22). One possible mechanism of
action could relate to the ability of mutant PARP-1 to recognize
platinum-DNA damage (23) and form trapped complexes that
shield the toxic platinum-modiﬁed lesions from repair and
promote accumulation of unrepaired damage.
Allosteric disruption of PARP-1 catalytic activity does not
prevent AR transcriptional regulatory functions
In addition to the DNA damage response, PARP-1 is involved
in a number of transcriptional regulation events (24). For
example, PARP-1 catalytic activity is necessary for AR
ligand–dependent transcription (15). To determine if allosteric
regulation is speciﬁc to the DNA damage response, the AR
transcriptional function was assessed in PARP-1/ MEFs
transiently transfected with PARP-1/WT, PARP-1/W318R, and
PARP-1/E988A. The catalytic mutant PARP-1/E988A is deﬁcient in AR transcription compared with WT (Fig. 3C, ref. 15),
whereas the interdomain mutant PARP-1/W318R exhibited
substantial ligand-induced AR reporter activity. Furthermore,
the ligand-induced AR reporter activity of PARP-1/W318R was
decreased in the presence of PARP inhibitor ABT-888, similar
to PARP-1/WT (Fig. 3C). Thus, disruption of PARP-1 allosteric
regulation shuts down DNA damage–dependent activity

without altering the catalytic domain per se, thus allowing
PARP-1 to maintain other important cellular functions outside
of the DNA damage response.
Development of a high-throughput method to detect
allosteric regulation
As PARP-1 inhibitors continue to hold tremendous promise
as targeted anticancer agents, there is a growing interest in
speciﬁc PARP-1 inhibitors. The unique structural aspects of the
PARP-1 complex of essential domains is therefore of particular
interest as a therapeutic target. Using the core components of
this complex as our target model (Fig. 4A), we developed a
high-throughput assay that is capable of detecting complex
formations in the presence of DNA. The assay is based on
ﬂuorescent polarization techniques and detects the binding of
WGR-CAT to a Zn1–Zn3 saturated DNA complex as an
increase in ﬂuorescence polarization (Fig. 4B). To validate
that the readout accurately represented allosteric activation,
we tested several mutants at the domain interfaces. Four
mutations were made along the Zn1–Zn3 interface: E76A,
R78A, W79A, and N242W; two mutations were made along
the Zn3-WGR-HD interface: W318R and W318A. Mutations in
the Zn1–Zn3 construct did not affect their DNA-binding
afﬁnity (Supplementary Fig. S4). When WGR-CAT was added
to the Zn1–Zn3 variants, the maximum change in polarization
(DPolarization) was notably lower for R78A, W79A, W318A,

www.aacrjournals.org

and W318R, although the estimated binding afﬁnity was
comparable with WT (Fig. 4C). The deﬁciency in DPolarization
correlated well with the observed deﬁciencies in DNA-dependent catalytic activity (Fig. 4D). The N242W mutant was
designed to mimic the steric clash of a potential small allosteric
inhibitor bound at the Zn1–Zn3 interface. In this instance, the
binding afﬁnity of WGR-CAT dropped 2-fold, and the rate of
PAR synthesis was reduced consistently. Mutations made in
WGR-CAT further validated the assay. When WGR residues
K633 and R735 were mutated to alanine, decreases in maximum polarization were seen in the high-throughput assay that
corresponded to the level of DNA-dependent PAR synthesis
(Fig. 4C and D). The mutant W589A is known to affect DNA
binding of WGR, and showed no increase in polarization, which
correlated well with its deﬁcient DNA-dependent activation.
Mutant E988A was used to show that direct disruption of the
catalytic domain does not inﬂuence the assay readout and,
therefore, catalytic site inhibitors would not be detected by
this assay.
Perspective
Although the use of PARP-1 inhibitors has been widely
deployed, the therapeutic beneﬁt from pan-PARP inhibition
(i.e., targeting multiple PARP family proteins), as opposed to
speciﬁc PARP-1 inhibition, is not clear. The functional roles
among PARPs are diverse, and cross-inhibition creates the

potential for deleterious off-target effects (13, 25). On the other
hand, increased therapeutic effectiveness can often accompany the complexities of polypharmacology, as exempliﬁed by
promiscuous kinase inhibitors (26). Selective pharmacologic
targeting of PARP-1 (and other PARPs) will be useful in
distinguishing therapeutic effectiveness from toxicity in complex diseases.
In this study, disruption of allosteric regulation was used to
model selective inhibition of PARP-1. Single-point mutations at
domain interfaces were used to disrupt allosteric regulation.
These mutants do not affect high-afﬁnity binding to DNA
damage, although they do have a pronounced effect on
DNA-dependent catalytic activation. In a cellular environment,
these observations are paralleled as mutant PARP-1 recruits to
sites of DNA damage, but fails to generate detectable PAR.
Interestingly, the role of PARP-1 in AR-dependent transcription was not severely affected, revealing applications of allosteric inhibitors in reducing potential off-target effects. We also
ﬁnd that high-afﬁnity DNA binding combined with catalytic
deﬁciency stalls release from DNA in the presence of NADþ.
The prolonged occupancy of mutant PARP-1 likely contributes
to sensitization of DNA-damaging agents by retaining unrepaired DNA damage.
We have identiﬁed a synergistic combination between
allosterically disrupted PARP-1 and platinum-based agents

will likely hold therapeutic potential in other types of
cancers when used as combination therapy (in a BRCA2WT setting) or as monotherapy, especially in the context of
BRCA1/2/Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient tumors (27). We have
developed a high-throughput assay to detect the allosteric

pharmacologic inhibitors. This study initiates an innovative
pipeline to identify an optimal compound that will disrupt
PARP-1 function in cancer cells.
