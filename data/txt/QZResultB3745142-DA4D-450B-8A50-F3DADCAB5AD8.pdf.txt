ABSTRACT
Despite of tremendous research efforts to profile prostate cancer, the genetic
alterations and biological processes that correlate with disease progression remain
partially elusive. In this study we show that the STAT3 small molecule inhibitor Stattic
caused S-phase accumulation at low-dose levels and led to massive apoptosis at
a relatively high-dose level in prostate cancer cells. STAT3 knockdown led to the
disruption of the microvascular niche which tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and nontumor initiating cells (non-TICs)depend on. Primary human prostate cancer cells and
prostate cancer cell line contained high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHhigh)
subpopulations with stem cell-like characteristics, which expressed higher levels
of the active phosphorylated form of STAT3 (pSTAT3) than that of non-ALDHhigh
subpopulations. Stattic could singnificantly decreas the population of ALDHhigh prostate
cancer cells even at low-dose levels. IL-6 can convert non-ALDHhigh cells to ALDHhigh
cells in prostate cancer cell line as well as from cells derived from human prostate
tumors, the conversion mediated by IL-6 was abrogated in the presence of STAT3
inhibitor or upon STAT3 knockdown. STAT3 knockdown significantly impaired the
ability of prostate cancer cells to initiate development of prostate adenocarcinoma.
Moreover, blockade of STAT3 signaling was significantly effective in eradicating the
tumor-initiating and bulk tumor cancer cell populations in both prostate cancer cellline xenograft model and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models. This data
suggests that targeting both tumor initiating and differentiated cell populations by
STAT3 inhibition is predicted to have greater efficacy for prostate cancer treatment.

rate associated with recurrent prostate cancer is high.
Although significant progress has been made in
understanding the molecular mechanisms of prostate
cancer development, the specific molecular regulatory
pathways involved in prostate cancer progression remain
elusive. Search for effective therapies for the management
of this disease has become a priority for researchers.

cancer stem cells (CSCs), have been implicated in tumor
formation, progression, and therapy-resistance in multiple
solid-organ cancers [2]. However, the development of
prostate TICs is not well understood and identification
of signaling pathways that regulate phenotypic and
tumorigenic potential of TICs might provide new insights
for drug development to prevent tumor drug resistance and
relapse in prostate cancer [3]. ALDH is an intracellular
enzyme involved in retinoic acid metabolism and its
activity has been shown to enrich for normal or malignant
stem cell populations in multiple organ systems [4-8].
The high ALDH expression in prostate cancer has been
shown to be positively correlated with the Gleason score
and inversely associated with overall survival of prostate
cancer patients [7]. High ALDH activity has successfully
been used to identify tumor-initiating and metastasisinitiating cells in human prostate cancer [8].
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
3 (STAT3) is the STAT family of transcription factors
activated by many cytokines and growth factors [9,
10, 11]. In normal cells, STAT3 modulates a variety of
biological functions by activating the transcription of a
diverse set of genes [12, 13]. Furthermore, STAT3 plays
an important role in maintaining pluripotency and selfrenewing processes in embryonic stem cells [14, 15]. In
these cells, activation of the STAT3 protein is a reversible,
tightly controlled process that typically lasts for a limited
duration [16]. Conversely, the persistent activation of
the STAT3 protein is detected at high frequency in a
large number of human malignancies [17, 18, 19, 20].
Aberrantly active STAT3 contributes to oncogenesis
by preventing apoptosis, inducing cell proliferation and
suppressing anti-tumor immune responses [16]. These
make STAT3 an excellent molecular candidate for cancer
therapy.
In this study, we investigated the role of activated
STAT3 signaling on differentiated cancer cell and TIC
development in prostate cancer. Our findings provide new
mechanistic insights for prostate cancer development.

specimens as compared to matched adjacent nontumor
tissues (Fig. 1).

STAT3 small molecule inhibitor blocks STAT3
activation and suppresses STAT3-mediated gene
expression in PC3M-1E8 cells
To investigate whether a STAT3 inhibitor could
inhibit STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells, PC3M1E8 prostate cancer cells were treated with different doses
of Stattic. The results showed that Stattic inhibited the
STAT3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, the total of STAT3 showed
no change (Fig. 2A and B). As was the case with STAT3
activation, Bcl-xL, survivin and c-Myc were likewise
downregulated after treatment with Stattic (Fig. 2 C).
Because Stattic treatment decreased the level of pSTAT3 in
PC3M-1E8 cells, we then determined the effect of Stattic
on nuclear translocation of pSTAT3. Immunostaining for
pSTAT3 nuclear staining in PC3M-1E8 cells following 24

RESULTS
Activated STAT3 is found in prostate cancer cell
line and prostate cancer tissues
To determine whether constitutive activation of
STAT3 is associated with prostate cancer in vitro and in
vivo, we first examined activated STAT3 expression by
Western blotting with anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr-705) antibody in
human PC3M-1E8 prostate cancer cells and a series of
14 primary prostate tumor (T) specimens with matched
adjacent nontumor (N) prostate tissues. The results
showed that a high pSTAT3 level was found in PC3M-1E8
cells, and higher levels of pSTAT3 were found, to different

Consistent with the immunoblotting results shown in Fig.
2A and B, the nuclear level of pSTAT3 and survivin in
PC3M-1E8 cells was significantly reduced in the presence
of Stattic at 10 μM concentration (Fig. 2D).
To study if IL-6 could induce STAT3 activation in
PC3M-1E8 cells and be inhibited by Stattic, PC3M-1E8
cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and
then treated with 25 ng/mL IL-6 and Stattic at indicated
concentration for 24 hours. The data suggested that IL-6
induced STAT3 activation and the IL-6-induced STAT3
activation was inhibited by Stattic in a dose-dependent
manner. (Fig. 2E and F).

in A2780 cells and HUVECs (Fig. 2I and J). Moreover,
IL-6-stimulated STAT3 activation largely failed to confer
resistance against Stattic-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2K).

Blocking STAT3 activation inhibits PC3M-1E8
cells colony formation in soft agar
To test the effect of blocking STAT3 activation on
tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells in vitro, a soft agar
colony formation assay was performed in PC3M-1E8 cells
treated with Stattic. The result showed that the inhibitory
effect of Stattic on the colony formation of PC3M-1E8
was significant even at a low dose. The average number
of colonies (colony was defined as >20 μm) in the 2.5 and
10 μM Stattic-treated cells was decreased by 23 and 93%,
respectively (Fig. 3A).

STAT3 activation is required for prostate cancer
cells growth and survival
To explore the effect of Stattic on cell growth and
apoptosis, PC3M-1E8 cells were treated with Stattic
at different doses and analyzed after 48 hours. PC3M1E8 cells showed no significant morphological changes
when treated with 2.5 and 5 μM Stattic, while most of
the cells became rounded and detached from the culture
plates when treated with 10 μM Stattic (Fig. 2G). Figure
2H summarizes the apoptotic effects of Stattic on PC3M1E8 cells by using the acridine orange fluorescent staining.
Then, we examined the apoptosis by flow cytometric
analysis and determined whether the growth inhibition was
associated with specific changes in cell cycle distribution.
The results displayed that PC3M-1E8 cells treated
with Stattic (2.5-10 μM)  showed  significant S phase
accumulation compared with the control (Table 1). 2.5μM
and 5 μM Stattic did not induce significant cell apoptosis,
whereas 10 μM Stattic induced 11-fold more cell apoptosis
compared to the control (Table 1). Additionally, to rule
out the non-specific cytotoxicity of Stattic, A2780 ovarian
cancer cells and HUVECs were treated with 20 μM Stattic,
which had little STAT3 phosphorylation recognized [21].
The results demonstrated that 20 μM Stattic could not

The presence and size of the population with

demonstrated that 7.0±0.7% of PC3M-1E8 cells expressed
high ALDH activity (ALDHhigh) (Fig. 3B). As shown in
Table 2, ALDHhigh subpopulations could be detected in all
cell preparations obtained from clinical prostate cancer
samples. Percentages of ALDHhigh cells were highly
variable and differed from patient to patient (with an
average size of 1.6% to 7.1% of all cancer cells). Then
the STAT3 phosphorylation of ALDHhigh subpopulations
in PC3M-1E8 cells and clinical prostate cancer samples
were examined. The results showed that the ALDHhigh
subpopulations in PC3M-1E8 cells and primary human
prostate cancer expressed higher levels of pSTAT3
compared with that of non-ALDHhigh subpopulations (Fig.

pluripotency of stem cells [22, 23]. As shown in Fig. 3F,
the protein levels of Oct-4 and Nanog were significantly
downregulated in PC3M-1E8 cells treated with Stattic.
Study proposed that differentiated cancer cells can convert
to stem-like cells to maintain equilibrium [24]. Indeed, our
results showed that the addition of IL-6 to non-ALDHhighderived cells resulted in a generation of ALDHhigh
subpopulation in PC3M-1E8 cells and primary prostate
cancer cells (Fig. 3F). The ALDHhigh subpopulation from
the non-ALDHhigh cells were truly TICs, as defined by
the tumor-forming ability in mice (Supplementary Table
S1). However, the conversion mediated by IL-6 was
significantly blocked in the presence of Stattic (Fig. 3G),
and the addition of IL-6 to STAT3 shRNA lentivirus
infected PC3M-1E8 cells didn’t significantly increased
their clonogenic capacity (Fig. 3H). The results suggest
that STAT3 is important for generation of TICs from nonTICs induced by IL-6.

To confirm the important role of STAT3 in prostate
TICs, we next assessed the effect of Stattic on ALDHhigh
cells. The results showed that Stattic inhibited the
expression of pSTAT3 in the ALDHhigh cells (Fig. 3D).
The inhibition of pSTAT3 by Stattic also downregulated
the expression of its downstream targets in ALDHhigh
cells, such as survivin and c-Myc (Fig. 3D). To examine
whether STAT3 inhibition might eliminate the ALDHhigh
subpopulation, we treated cancer cells with different
doses of Stattic. Our results showed that Stattic effectively
eliminated the ALDHhigh subpopulation in PC3M-1E8 cells
and primary cell cultures from different clinical prostate
cancer samples, even at a low doses (Fig. 3E), suggesting
that this subpopulation of prostate TICs is sensitive to
STAT3-mediated inhibition.
Oct-4, Nanog and c-Myc are the key stemness
factors and required for maintaining self-renewal and

reduced (Fig. 4B and C). In contrast, STAT3 and pSTAT3
expression were not affected by the nontargeting shRNA
lentivirus (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence also showed
that STAT3 shRNA lentivirus infected cells did not show
pSTAT3 in the nucleus (Fig. 4D).
We next examined whether the knockdown of
STAT3 in PC3M-1E8 cells could significantly impact
endothelial cell growth. We performed a coculture
experiment as previously described [27], in which
PC3M-1E8 cells were cultured in an upper chamber
while HUVECs were planted in the lower wells (Fig.
4E). These two chambers were separated by a permeable
membrane with 0.4 μm pores, which prevented physical
contact between cancer cells and endothelial cells, but
allowed transfer of secreted factors. The results showed

Angiogenesis is critical to tumor formation and
maintenance [25]. We first determined whether STAT3
was required for VEGF expression in PC3M-1E8 cells.
We knocked down STAT3 by RNA interference using a
dicistronic lentivirus shRNA delivery system as previously
described [26]. After exposure of PC3M-1E8 cells to the
lentivirus encoding shRNA of STAT3 and GFP, most of the
cells expressed GFP 72 hours after the infection (Fig. 4A).
Cell sorting was carried out by selecting cells expressing
the GFP marker at 72 hours postinfection. As shown in Fig.

depleted from the PC3M-1E8 cells after STAT3 shRNA

accurate measurement of tumor growth, mice of control
and Stattic treated groups were sacrificed to determine
tumor weight after receiving the second, fifth or ninth
treatment. As shown in Fig. 5D, when tumors in the
control group expanded and those in Stattic treated group
were significantly arrested. Control animals developed
symptoms such as anorexia and weight loss before they
were put down, whereas Stattic-treated animals remained
symptom free. Confirming the in vitro findings, western
blotting of tumor lysates also revealed a significant
reduction in pSTAT3 protein levels and its downstream
target proteins in mice treated with Stattic (Fig. 5E).
We used flow cytometry to determine the percentage
of ALDHhigh subpopulation in the tumors treated with
vehicle or Stattic. The results showed Stattic treatment
significantly reduced the percentage of ALDHhigh cells
(Fig. 5F).
Next, we further analyzed the effect of Stattic
on tumor growth in PDTX models. The ALDHhigh
subpopulations in three patient-derived xenografts were
detectable to various extents (Supplementary Table
S2). However, within a given patient xenograft lineage,
the relative percentage of ALDHhigh subpopulation
remained conserved through F1 to F3 passages in mice
(Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that the xenotrans-plantation process did not affect ALDH expression.
Western blotting of tumor lysates showed that high
pSTAT3 protein levels were found in all patient-derived F3
xenografts (Fig. 5G). To determine the extent of pSTAT3
inhibition by Stattic in the three individual patient-derived
tumors, Western blot analysis of pSTAT3 in xenograft
tumors was performed at the end of the experiments.
As shown in Fig. 5H, in vivo treatment with Stattic
greatly decreased the levels of pSTAT3 protein in the
three individual patient-derived tumors. Treatment with
Stattic resulted in a significant decrease in tumor volume

STAT3 knockdown impairs prostate tumor cell
tumorigenicity in vivo
To investigate the effect of STAT3 knockdown
on prostate tumor cell tumorigenicity, we injected
either STAT3 knock-down or control PC3M-1E8 cells
subcutaneously into athymic nude mice and monitored
tumor growth over 4 weeks. As shown in Fig. 5A, PC3M1E8 cells transduced with nontargeting shRNA control
rapidly formed tumor, in contrast, PC3M-1E8 cells
transduced with STAT3 shRNA displayed increased tumor
latency and decreased tumor growth rate, concomitant
with reduction of CSC marker expression in tumor (Fig.

To determine if the effects of blocking STAT3

cancer. In addition, we also demonstrated that the
proapoptotic response to Stattic in PC3M-1E8 cells was
not significantly impaired by IL-6–mediated activation of
STAT3.
While the successful cancer cures require
eliminating all tumor cells, TICs may represent particular
therapeutic challenges. Optimal development of specific
agents against TICs may involve targeting critical
regulators or signaling pathways for the maintenance of
stem cells. For prostate cancer, the main effort to target
constitutive STAT3 signaling is only focused on the bulk
of cancer cells at the present time. Our study demonstrated
that human prostate cancer cell line and surgical
specimens contained a subpopulation of ALDHhigh cells
which expressed higher level of pSTAT3. The effective
elimination of the subproportion of ALDHhigh cells in the
PC3M-1E8 cells and primary prostate cancer cells by
Stattic suggested that these TIC-like cells were sensitive
to STAT3 inhibition. Recently, researchers proposed that
differentiated cancer cells (non-TICs) are able to convert
to stem-like cells to maintain equilibrium [24, 34]. These
results imply that removing TICs may prompt non-TICs
in the tumor to convert into stem cells to maintain the
equilibrium [24]. We found that the expression of stem cell
markers was effectively suppressed by Stattic and STAT3
played an important role in IL-6-mediated conversion of
non-TICs to TICs. Therefore, we suggested that targeting
STAT3 therapy not only directly killed existing TICs, but
that it indirectly lowered the TIC burden by inhibiting the
conversion of non-TICs to TICs.
The perivascular niche plays a vital role in
controlling the unique properties of TIC populations [35].
In this study, we demonstrated that STAT3 contributed
to the ability of prostate cancer to support angiogenesis.
Thus, systemic inhibition of STAT3 may not only directly
target prostate CSC self-renewal, but may also disrupt the
functional vascular niches that are essential for prostate
CSC maintenance. It is unlikely that anti-CSC therapies
will be effective in isolation, therefore, the potential
effects of STAT3 inhibition on angiogenesis may offer
synergies.
To test the tumor dependence on STAT3, we used
shRNA to specifically knock down STAT3. Our results
showed that the blockade of STAT3 significantly impaired
the ability of prostate cancer cells to initiate development
of prostate adenocarcinoma. PDTX tumours maintain the
molecular, genetic and histological heterogeneity typical
of tumours of origin through serial passaging in mice
[36]. The tumour histology of PDTX models provides
an excellent in vivo preclinical platform to study CSC
biology and novel cancer therapeutics [36]. Using the
PDTX model, we presented the results with three patientderived carcinomas treated with Stattic, simulating the
first stage of a classic human two-stage phase II clinical
trial. The data from our study showed that Stattic was
capable of suppressing tumor growth, increasing survival

DISCUSSION
Presently, there are no effective pharmacological
therapies for metastatic and castration-resistant prostate
cancer [28]. Therefore, it is important to explore the
molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and
progression of this disease to identify novel therapeutic
targets and develop effective treatment strategies.
In this study, we first investigated whether
constitutive activation of STAT3 protein is associated
with prostate cancer in vivo. Our findings are consistent
with the study showing significantly higher levels of
constitutively active STAT3 in primary prostate tumor
specimens compared to matched adjacent nontumor
tissues [29]. Using the STAT3 small molecule inhibitor,
Stattic, which has been shown to selectively inhibit
the function of the STAT3 SH2 domain regardless of
STAT3 phosphorylation status [30], we showed that
Stattic potentially prevented phosphorylation of STAT3
in prostate cancer cells. The Tyr705 phosphorylation of
STAT3 results in its homodimerization. Then the STAT3
dimer translocates to the nucleus for binding to specific
DNA sequences on the promoter of its target genes [9, 10].
Our study indicated that the Stattic-mediated inhibition
of STAT3 phosphorylation suppressed its transcriptional
activity as evidenced by the decrease in the constitutive
nuclear translocation of pSTAT3 and the suppression of
the STAT3-regulated gene products (e.g., Bcl-xL, survivin
and c-Myc) in Stattic-treated PC3M-1E8 cells. In addition,
STAT3 shRNA was used to inhibit the STAT3 expression
and activity. Our results showed that STAT3 shRNA also
inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 downstream
genes expression in PC3M-1E8 cells. Levels of IL-6 are
elevated in the serum of patients with hormone-refractory
and metastatic prostate carcinoma [31, 32]. In the present
study, it was found that IL-6 was able to induce STAT3
activation, but the activation could be blocked by Stattic
in a dose-dependent manner in PC3M-1E8 cells.
In agreement with the inhibition of STAT3
activation and nuclear localization, Stattic caused S-phase
accumulation at low-dose levels and led to massive
apoptosis at a relatively high-dose level in PC3M-1E8
cells.   In view of toxicity of anticancer drugs, optimal
scheduling is potentially useful in improving these
treatments. One of the conceivable strategies of protocol
optimization, exploiting drug specificity, is to arrest cancer
cells in the S phase [33]. As shown in the present study,
Stattic may cause S-phase arrest in PC3M-1E8cells, thus,
it may be a useful therapeutic tool in human prostate

envelope plasmid pMD.G and gene transfer plasmid
pLVTH were provided by Dr. Ralph B. Arlinghaus at the
University of Texas. The STAT3 shRNA sequence and the
nontargeting sequence used in this study were synthesized,
according to the published sequence [39]. The PC3M-1E8
cells were infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 8
μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).

in PDTX models. These results indicate that STAT3 is
required for maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype.
Our findings strongly suggest that targeting STAT3
signals may be useful as both TICs and non-TICs directed
therapy. Our studies provide evidence that inhibiting
STAT3 pathways should be considered for further
exploitation in therapeutic development of prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical tissues

Western blot analysis

Human primary prostate tumors and adjacent
nontumor tissues were obtained after obtaining informed
consent according to protocols approved by the Ethics
Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College.
The fresh tumor specimen were collected, either at
the time of surgical resection or by a tumor biopsy and
prepared for implantion in immunodeficient mice, singlecell suspension as described [8, 37] or immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. All specimens were
examined by a pathologist and confirmed the malignant
and non-malignant tissues. None of these patients had
received preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative
radiation therapy.
Because of the priority assigned to the pathological
evaluation, for each patient only a limited amount of
tissue was available for investigation. Therefore, not all
of the assays listed below could be performed in the same
patients.

Standard western blot analysis was performed
with antibodies for STAT3, pSTAT3 (Tyr705), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), survivin, c-Myc,
Nanog, Oct-4, β-actin (Santa Cruz, CA) and Bcl-xL (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The protein bands
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).

Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
Fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V and
propidium iodide staining (BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA) were used to determine apoptosis and to
analyze the DNA content.

Immunoluorescence staining
Immunoluorescence staining was preformed as
previously described [40].

Cell culture

Colony formation assay

PC3M-1E8 prostate cancer cells were obtained
from the China Center for Type Culture Collection
(Shanghai, People’s Republic of China) and A2780
ovarian cancer cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were
cultivated according to the supplier’s instructions. Human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated
as previously described [38]. All cells were maintained
in a 37°C atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were
used at low passages and not cultured for more than two
months. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma and
found free of mycoplasma. Stattic, a previously reported
STAT3 inhibitor [30], was purchased from Sigma (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).

Colony formation assay was performed as
previously described [1]. The plates were fed weekly
with 0.5 ml of DMEM/10% FBS containing the indicated
concentrations of Stattic.

ALDEFLUOR assay
For ALDH staining, cells were trypsinized to single
cells and subsequently suspended in ALDEFLUOR assay
buffer containing ALDH substrate and then incubated
for 35 minutes at 37°C, following the manufacturer’s
instructions (StemCell Technologies, Aldagen, Inc.,
Durham, NC). After staining, cells were kept in ice during
all subsequent procedures. For each experiment, a sample
of cells was stained under identical conditions with a
specific ALDH inhibitor, diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB), as a ALDH-negative control, following the

Lentiviral infections

manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of intracellular
fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. For
ALDEFLUOR assay in xenograft tumors by flow
cytometry, in order to eliminate cells of mouse origin from
the xenograft tumors, staining with an anti-H2Kd antibody
was used followed by staining with a secondary antibody
labeled with PE, both from BD Pharmingen.

mice (T/C). Eight mice per group were monitored for
death and were euthanized when they appeared moribund.

Statistical analysis
All values were given as means ± SD of at least
three independent experiments. The significance of
differences between groups was assessed by two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was defined as p <
0.05. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method
and differences were analyzed by a log-rank test.

In vitro angiogenesis evaluation
In vitro formation of tubular structures was studied
on an extracellular matrix as described below. Briefly,
24-well plates were coated with cold matrigel (BD
Biosciences) (80 μl/well of a solution of 9:1 Matrigel to
10 × buffer). Then, 1 × 105 HUVECs, suspended in the
conditioned media collected from cell cultures of PC3M1E8 cells transduced with STAT3 shRNA, were seeded
in each well. After 16 hours incubation, angiogenesis was
assessed based on formation of capillary-like structures.
The number of capillary-like tubes was counted in five
randomly chosen microscopic fields (Nikon Eclipse,
TE2000-U), and the average was calculated.

Xenograft tumor models
The animal studies were approved by the Ethics
Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College.
Athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased from the
Animal Experimental Center of Slaccas (Shanghai,
People’s Republic of China). The 4- to 6-week-old male
mice were maintained in laminar flow cabinets under
specific pathogen free conditions. For tumorigenicity
study, after lentiviral infection and selection, 4 × 106
PC3M-1E8 cells were subcutaneously injected into mice
in 100 mL of BD matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored
weekly for 4 weeks. To detect the effects of STAT3
inhibition in vivo, 4 × 106 PC3M-1E8 cells were inoculated
into mice in an identical fashion as described above and
allowed to develop into a tumor of 5–6 mm in diameter
before treatment. Then, mice were randomly distributed
into two treatment groups: (a) control vehicle (100%
DMSO) and (b) 20 mg/kg of Stattic. Stattic or DMSO was
administered via intraperitoneal injection on a Q3D × 9
schedule. The tumors were measured in two dimensions
with calipers weekly, and the volume was calculated as
length × width2 × 1/2. The PDTX models were established
as previously described [37]. Xenografts from the third
generation (F3) were measured with ultrasound and
allowed to grow to a size of ~200 mm3, at which time
the animal models were treated in an identical fashion as
described in PC3M-1E8 xenograft model studies. Five
mice was euthanized and the tumors were harvested on
day 28 following first treatment. Relative tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) was calculated by relative tumor growth
of treated mice divided by relative tumor growth of control
