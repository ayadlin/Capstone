ABSTRACT
Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is associated with the development of
different types of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related lymphoma, has been suggested to be
an important oncoprotein. In this study, a human anti-LMP1 IgG antibody (LMP1-IgG)
was constructed and characterized by ELISA, western blotting (WB), affinity and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. CCK-8, MTT, apoptosis assays, antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity)
assays were performed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of LMP1-IgG on extranodal
nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Then, the influence of
LMP1-IgG on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was investigated. The results showed
that the successfully constructed LMP1-IgG inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis,
and activated ADCC and CDC of ENKTL in a concentration- and time- dependent
manner. Moreover, phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3 was inhibited by LMP1-IgG.
Our data indicate that LMP1-IgG may provide a novel and promising therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of LMP1-positive ENKTL.

INTRODUCTION

is highly aggressive and critically difficult to heal, with
a median overall survival of less than 8 months [5].
In ENKTL, recurrent drug resistance and immune suppression
are common, and the prognosis of ENKTL patients for whom
initial therapy fails is tremendously poor [6]. Currently, the
lack of any established therapy protocols for ENKTL patients
presents a major obstacle for ENKTL treatment [7]. There
continues to be an urgent demand for innovative and effective
therapeutic strategies to treat ENKTL.

Extranodal nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell
lymphoma (ENKTL) is a subgroup of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas (NHLs) characterized by progressive necrotic
lesions in the nasal cavity and/or extranasal sites [1–3].
Epidemiologically, ENKTL accounts for 3–8% of
malignant lymphomas in China and is more prevalent in
Asian than in Western countries [4]. Clinically, ENKTL

The tumorigenesis of ENKTL is highly associated
with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection [8]. Latent
membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a substantial oncoprotein
encoded by EBV, has been suggested to have multiple
malignant functions in the development and progression
of EBV-related ENKTL [9, 10]. Identification of LMP1
expression is drawing attention as a favorable target for
ENKTL treatment [11, 12]. In our previous researches, we
have reported the prognostic characteristics of LMP1 in
lymphoma and have generated an anti-LMP1 Fab antibody
(LMP1-Fab), exerting potential anti-tumor activity in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) [13–18]. Because of the
remarkable relationships between LMP1 expression and
ENKTL properties, an anti-LMP1 antibody should bring
positive consequences in ENKTL treatment.
In this present study, we developed a human antiLMP1 IgG antibody (LMP1-IgG) based on the earlier
LMP1-Fab antibody. Then, we tested the characteristics
and the anti-cancer efficiency of LMP1-IgG in ENKTL.
Moreover, we explored the potential mechanism by which
LMP1-IgG inhibits ENKTL development.

that the LMP1-IgG possessed a high affinity for LMP1.
The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for LMP1-IgG
was 3.175 × 10–9M (Figure 2D).

RESULTS

To determine the tumor inhibitory effect of LMP1IgG, we determined SNK6 and SNT8 cell proliferation by
using CCK-8 and MTT assays, respectively. Cells were
cultured in medium with 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 μg/ml of LMP1IgG for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h. In both CCK-8 and MTT
assays, at 20 μg/ml LMP1-IgG after 48 h of incubation,
the growth of SNK6 and SNT8 cells was significantly
decreased compared with that of YT cells (Figure 4A1,
A42, 4B1, 4B2), a result suggesting that LMP1-IgG
suppresses ENKTL growth. The IC50 of LMP1-IgG in
SNK6 and SNT8 cells was 7.421 μg/ml and 17.68 μg/ml,
respectively. To determine whether LMP1-IgG could
induce cell apoptosis in ENKTL cells, we performed
an Annexin V/PI assay. The results showed significant
increases in the apoptotic rates of SNK6 and SNT8 cells
in a concentration- and time- dependent manner after
treatment with LMP1-IgG. By contrast, the apoptotic rate
in YT cells was low and scarcely changed after LMP1-IgG
treatment (Figure 4C1–4C4).

IHC analysis
IHC was performed in ENKTL tissue samples to
further confirm the ability of LMP1-IgG to detect LMP1
expression in clinical samples. A commercial LMP1
antibody (C-LMP1) was used as a positive control.
As shown in Figure 3, LMP1 expression was observed
in 16/26 (61.5%) cases in the LMP1-IgG group and
18/26 (69.2%) cases in the C-LMP1 group. The LMP1
expression was barely different between the LMP1-IgG
and C-LMP1 groups, thus indicating the comparable
ability of LMP1 to be recognized by LMP1-IgG and
C-LMP1.

LMP1-IgG decreases ENKTL cell viability and
induces apoptosis

Construction, expression and purification of
LMP1-IgG
The LMP1-VH (360 bp) and LMP1-VK (321  bp)
variable regions were successfully obtained from a previous
LMP1-Fab clone (Figure 1A). Two eukaryotic expression
vectors (pTH-VH and pTH-VK) were double digested
and joined with LMP1-VH and LMP1-VK by IF-PCR
separately (Figure 1B). Then, the two recombinant vectors
(pTH-LMP1-VH and pTH-LMP1-VK) were transfected
with a FreeStyle™ 293 Expression System, and the cell
supernatant was harvested. Finally, LMP1-IgG was purified
and confirmed with SDS-PAGE (Figure 1C and 1D).

Characterization of LMP1-IgG
LMP1 expression in ENKTL cells (SNK6, SNT8
and YT) was firstly detected. The information of Figure 2A
confirmed positive LMP1 expression in SNK6 and SNT8
cells. In comparison, negative LMP1 expression was
observed in YT cells. ELISA was further performed to test
the binding sensitivity of LMP1-IgG to LMP1. As shown
in Figure 2B, LMP1-IgG recognized LMP1, which was
expressed in SNK6 and SNT8 cells in -dependent manner,
and the absorbance values of LMP1-IgG in LMP1-positive
and -negative cells differed significantly. WB testing
showed that LMP1-IgG (uncleaved) could recognize LMP1
which expressed in SNK6 and SNT8 cells. In comparison,
LMP1-IgG was cleaved by the papain enzyme and failed to
recognize LMP1 (Figure 2C). An affinity assay suggested

LMP1-IgG activates ADCC and CDC
Compared with Fab antibodies, IgG antibodies
are theoretically able to induce cell death via both
ADCC and CDC mechanisms; hence, we investigated
the ADCC and CDC effects of LMP1-IgG. As shown in
Figure 5A and 5B, as the concentration increased, LMP1IgG triggered cell death via ADCC and CDC in SNK6
and SNT8 cells, but not in YT cells. In comparison, an
unrelated IgG did not produce ADCC and CDC effects.

ENKL cells

tyrosine kinases. As shown in Figure 6B, LMP1-IgG
inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK3 in a dose- and timedependent manner, but it rarely influenced that of JAK1,
JAK2 and TYK2.
Moreover, we tried to knockdown the LMP1
expression in SNK6 cells and the phosphorylation
of JAK3 and STAT3 was retested. LMP1-siRNA2
showed stronger inhibition of LMP1 expression and
was chosen for use in subsequent experiments (Figure
6C). Knockdown of LMP1 expression attenuated the
inhibition of phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3
(SNK6-LMP1Si), whereas substantial reduction of
phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3 was still observed
in the control siRNA group (SNK6-LMP1Scr) (Figure
6D and 6E). The above results suggest that LMP1-IgG
exerted tumor-inhibitory function by affecting JAK3/
STAT3 activity.

Since the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a key
molecular factor of ENKTL, we further analyzed the
effects of LMP1-IgG on the proliferative and survival
signals of JAK/STAT in ENKTL. SNK6 cells were treated
with LMP1-IgG at different concentrations and incubation
times. As shown in Figure 6A, phosphorylation of STAT3
was significantly inhibited after LMP1-IgG treatment
in SNK6 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner. In comparison, phosphorylation of STAT5 was
rarely changed.
Phosphorylation of STAT3 can be induced by tyrosine
kinases of the Janus family (JAKs); we subsequently
treated SNK6 cells with LMP1-IgG to examine the
activation (phosphorylation) levels of the relevant

DISCUSSION

expression vectors were prepared, and LMP1-IgG
expression vectors were subsequently produced by IF-PCR.
Then we successfully transfected the recombinant vectors
and purified the LMP1-IgG, which was confirmed by a
series of characterization experiments. Moreover, we
tested the efficacy of LMP1- IgG at labeling LMP1 in
ENKTL by IHC analysis. Compared with C-LMP1,
LMP1-IgG displayed an equivalent ability to identify
positive LMP1 ENKTL cells, thus further verifying the
characteristics of LMP-IgG. Similar protocols were used
in our previous study to investigate the function of LMP1Fab in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) diagnosis [30].
Because LMP1-Fab has exhibited tumor-inhibitory
potentiality in NPC [16, 17] and LMP1 plays important
roles in ENKTL progression [9, 14, 15], whole LMP1-IgG
is theoretically supposed to exert more significant antitumor effectiveness in ENKTL. Bearing this in mind, we
performed a series of experiments to detect the tumorinhibitory role of LMP1-IgG in vitro. The results of
CCK-8 and MTT assays demonstrated that LMP1-IgG
was able to inhibit the proliferation of SNK6 and SNT8
cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover,
the data of Annexin V/PI showed that with an increase
of concentration and duration of LMP1-IgG in ENKTL

Antibody-based therapy is one of the most important
strategies for cancer treatment, and a number of antibodybased drugs are undergoing clinical trials [19]. In our
previous researches, we have identified several oncogenic
biomarkers and produced related engineered antibodies
through phage display technology [20, 21], including
anti-LMP1 Fab [16, 17], anti-Trop2 Fab [22, 23], antiMAGE-A1 scFv [24] and anti-hWAPL scFv [25].
However, a significant disadvantage is that phage display
technology can-not construct full-length antibodies [26],
but only antibody fragments (including Fab and scFv) that
must be further transformed into whole IgG molecules
to perform functions. Several disadvantages of antibody
fragments remains to be further studied and resolved,
such as the low absolute tissue uptake of Fab and the high
degradation of scFv by proteases [27, 28]. In comparison,
full-length IgG antibodies provide substantial benefits,
such as increasing half-life in the circulation system,
stimulating the complement system and engaging Fc
receptor-mediated effector functions [29].
In this present study, we first constructed an LMP1-IgG
antibody, on the basis of the previous LMP1-Fab. Eukaryotic

was HRP-conjugated anti-mouse Fab (Figure 2B). (D) An affinity assay demonstrated that LMP1-IgG possessed high affinity for LMP1.

cells, the apoptosis rate of SNK6 and SNT8 cells also
elevated. LMP1 is widely acknowledged to act as an
important oncoprotein that modulates several signaling
pathways, including the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB),
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase(PI3K) signaling pathways, thus promoting cell
growth and suppressing apoptosis [31, 32]. In NPC for
example, LMP1 preserves the cancer stemness of NPC
cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway [33]; LMP1
critically mediates transformation of nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells and facilitates FGF2/FGFR1 signaling
activation in the EBV-driven pathogenesis of NPC [34]. In
lymphoma, LMP1 protects lymphoma cells from cell death
through the collagen-mediated activation of a receptor
tyrosine kinase and makes an important contribution to
promote the oncogenic effects of EBV [35]; LMP1 has also
been reported to aggravate malignant cell function, induce
surviving expression and inhibit cell apoptosis through NF-

κB and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways [9, 36]. All the above
data support that LMP1-IgG demonstrates dramatic ability
to inhibit cell growth and accelerate cell apoptosis.
For therapeutic antibodies, ADCC and CDC have
been proven to be important modes of action [37]. Recent
studies have reported that IgG can activate component
C1 through hexamers and lead to target cell killing by
CDC via membrane attack complexes [38]. IgG amino
acid residues that modulate FcγR binding can be modified
to promote ADCC [39]. It is rational to hypothesize that
ADCC and CDC may also play imperative roles in the
tumor-inhibitory effectiveness of LMP1-IgG in ENKTL.
The following data validated our presumption that LMP1IgG would successfully activates ADCC and CDC in
SNK6 and SNT8 cells, although the levels of ADCC and
CDC varied in the two ENKTL cell lines. Several recent
studies have described similar functions of antibody drugs
in cancer therapy [40, 41].

The JAK/STAT pathway is crucial in signaling
by cytokine receptors, blood formation and the immune
response [42]. Consequently, it is well acknowledged
that the JAK/STAT pathway plays tremendous roles
in oncogenesis, including lymphomagenesis [43, 44].
Bouchekioua et al. have reported that activation of the
JAK3/STAT3 pathway exerts major activity in ENKTL
cell growth and survival; whereas tumor growth could be
significantly suppressed by a JAK inhibitor [45]. Similarly,
Coppo et al. have described that STAT3 activation is
constitutively triggered and that the oncogenic STAT3
protein has important functions in the oncogenic process
of ENKTL [46]. Because LMP1 has been stated to directly
activate the JAK/STAT pathway, which is critical for
ENKTL development [47, 48], we inevitably assumed
that LMP1-IgG might display ENKTL-inhibitory
characteristics by interfering with the JAK/STAT pathway.
Therefore, we tested the effect of LMP1-IgG on the JAK/
STAT pathway in ENKTL. The results showed that LMP1IgG significantly inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3
but barely influenced the phosphorylation of STAT5. In
comparison, the expression levels of STAT3 and STAT5
were stable after LMP1-IgG treatment. Subsequently, we
continued to evaluate the effect of LMP1-IgG on signaling
upstream of STAT. The data revealed that LMP1-IgG
further blocked the phosphorylation of JAK3 but had no
effect on the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2.
Then, we explored whether LMP1-IgG influences the
JAK/STAT pathway through recognizing LMP1. We
employed siRNA to decrease LMP1 expression in SNK6
cells. The results manifested that the inhibition of JAK3

and STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly reduced
in the LMP1Si group (SNK6-LMP1Si). In comparison,
the inhibition of JAK3 and STAT3 phosphorylation was
witnessed in the LMP1Scr group (SNK6-LMP1Scr). The
above data implied that disruption of the JAK3/STAT3
pathway might be one of the potential mechanisms for
LMP1-IgG’s ENKTL-inhibitory ability. Several studies’
conclusions lend further support to our results and have
suggested that targeting the JAK/STAT pathway may be a
promising strategy for ENKTL therapy [49–51].
Interestingly, a previous study has shown that
LMP1 can activate JAK3, as well as the downstream
targets include STAT5 [52]. However, we did not detect
an activity of LMP1-IgG in phosphorylation of STAT5
or expression of STAT5. The inconsistent data may be a
result of the differences in tumor types, antigen epitopes
or antibodies used. Future research is required to confirm
our findings.
In addition, one major disadvantage of this present
study is that we were unable to produce in vivo results. We
encountered several problems in xenograft construction
in BALB/c nude mice as a model for ENKTL, and new
in vivo experiments on NSG mice are ongoing. We intend
to draft a new paper specifically concerning the in vivo
effectiveness of LMP1-IgG in ENKTL with the latest
updated data.
To sum up, this study herein illustrates that a novel
neutralized human LMP1-IgG exerts potent antitumor
ability in ENKTL by interfering with the JAK/STAT
pathway. Our findings may provide a novel and promising
strategy for targeted therapy in ENKTL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ENKTL patients and tissue samples

Cell lines and reagents

Tissue samples from 26 ENKTL patients for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were enrolled as
previously described [56].

A human LMP1-Fab was generated and preserved in
our lab [16]. Three ENTKL cell lines SNK6, SNT8 and YT
were also preserved in our lab and enrolled in the present
study [53, 54]. SNK6 and SNT8 are LMP1-positive,
whereas YT is LMP1-negative [10, 55]. Anti-β-actin was
purchased from Boster Co., Ltd. (Boster, Wuhan, China).
All other antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). The 293Free style cells and 293F
expression culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two eukaryotic
expression vectors (pTH-VH and pTH-VK) were purchased
from Invitrogen Co., Ltd. (San Diego, CA, USA). An InFusionR HD Cloning Kit was purchased from Clontech
(Clontech Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Fresh human serum
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
donated of Dr. Yuan Mao. All study protocols followed
the guidelines and were approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committees of Nanjing Medical University.

Construction, expression and purification of
LMP1-IgG
LMP1-IgG variable regions of the heavy (VH) and
light chains (VK) were first amplified by PCR using an
LMP1-Fab clone as the template [17]. The primers for
VH and VK of LMP1-IgG were designed according to the
protocol of Infusion-PCR (IF-PCR) and the primers were
as follows: VH forward: 5′-GGT GTC CAC TCG CTA
CAG GTG CAG CTG GTG-3′ and VH reverse: 5′-GCC
CTT GGT GGA TGC TGA GGA GAC GGT GAC-3′;
VK forward: 5′-ACA GAT GCC AGA TGC GAC ATC
CAG ATG ACC-3′ and VK reverse: 5′-TGC AGC CAC
CGT ACG TTT GAT CTC CAG CTT-3′ (Table 1). Two
eukaryotic expression vectors (pTH-VH and pTH-VK)
were then digested [57] and VH and VK were separately

by IF-PCR with In-FusionR HD Cloning Kit. Then, the
recombinant vectors were transfected into FreeStyle™
293-F Cells (293F) with a FreeStyle™ 293 Expression
System (Invitrogen). After transient transfection for 120 h,
the cell supernatant was harvested and purified with a
Hitrap protein A column (AKTA Purifier 100, GE, USA)
as previously described [57].

LDH release by LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China). For the CDC assay, ENKTL cells were
incubated with LMP1-IgG, and this was followed by the
addition of 20% human serum or heat-inactivated human
serum. Then, the cell supernatants were added to a 96-well
plate to evaluate LDH release with a LDH Cytotoxicity
Assay Kit (Beyotime). Both assays were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions [67].

Characterization of LMP1-IgG

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection

ELISA, western blotting (WB), and affinity assays
(BiaCoreX100) for investigating the characteristics of
LMP1-IgG were performed as previously described [22, 57].

Two LMP1-siRNAs and a control-scrambled siRNA
were chemically synthesized by Sigma Chemical  Co.,
Ltd. (St. Louis, MO,  USA). The sequences of the
control‑siRNA and LMP1-siRNAs were as follows:
control siRNA forward 5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC

UAU CUA CAA A-3′, reverse 5′-UUU GUU GUA GAU
AGA GAG C-3′ (Table 1).

IHC analysis
IHC analysis was further performed to verify the
function of LMP1-IgG to identify ENKTL samples. The
protocol of IHC analysis was as described previously
[58–65].

Cell viability and apoptosis assays

The influence of LMP1-IgG on the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway

Cell viability was tested by using CCK-8 (Dojindo
Laboratories, Japan) and MTT assays following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell apoptosis was
investigated by Annexin V/PI as previously described
[22, 66]. An unrelated-IgG was employed as a control
antibody.

WB analyses of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
were performed as previously described [22]. The JAK/
STAT signaling pathway was investigated in SNK6 cells
with LMP1-siRNA transfection (SNK6-LMP1siRNA) and
scrambled LMP1-siRNA transfection (SNK6-LMP1scr)
after treatment with LMP1-IgG.

ADCC and CDC assays

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

For the ADCC assay, ENKTL cells (target cells)
were incubated with LMP1-IgG. An unrelated IgG was
used as the control. PBMCs were used (effector cells)
and incubated with ENKTL cells at a fixed effector/target
ratio of 25:1. After a 4-hour incubation at 37°C, the cell
supernatants were added to a 96-well plate to evaluate
