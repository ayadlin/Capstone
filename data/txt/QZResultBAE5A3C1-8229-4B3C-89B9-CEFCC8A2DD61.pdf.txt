Abstract
We have recently shown that macrophage-stimulating protein
(MSP) promotes the invasion of recepteur d’origine nantais
(RON), a tyrosine kinase receptor–positive MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, and also identified the
regulatory elements required for RON gene expression. In this
report, we have analyzed the efficacy of a chemopreventive
agent, curcumin, in blocking RON tyrosine kinase–mediated
invasion of breast cancer cells. Reverse transcription-PCR
and Western analysis indicated the down-regulation of the
RON message and protein, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells. Significantly, curcumin-mediated inhibition of RON expression resulted in the blockade of RON ligand,
MSP-induced invasion of breast cancer cells. We have
identified two putative nuclear factor-KB p65 subunit binding
sites on the RON promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the
RON promoter, we have confirmed the binding of p65 to the
RON promoter. Our data show that curcumin reduces RON
expression by affecting p65 protein expression and transcriptional activity. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of p65, or small interfering
RNA knockdown of p65, blocked RON gene expression and
MSP-mediated invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. This is the
first report showing the regulation of human RON gene
expression by nuclear factor-KB and suggests a potential
therapeutic role for curcumin in blocking RON tyrosine
kinase–mediated invasion of carcinoma cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The central role played by receptor tyrosine kinases in the
control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis of
different types of cancers renders these proteins an attractive
target for molecular-based cancer therapy. The human recepteur
d’origine nantais (RON) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) of 1,400 amino acids that belong to the MET gene family.
RON is initially synthesized as a single-chain precursor, 170 kDa
pro-RON, which is subsequently cleaved into the 40 kDa a-chain
and 150 kDa h-chain. The a-chain is extracellular, whereas the

h-chain traverses the cell membrane and contains the intracellular
tyrosine kinase (1). Amplification and/or overexpression of RON
was reported in various epithelial cancers (2–5). Macrophagestimulating protein (MSP) is the only known ligand for RON.
MSP is an 80 kDa heterodimer consisting of a 53 kDa a-chain and
a 30 kDa h-chain linked by a disulfide bond. The h-chain of
MSP binds to RON (1). The RON receptor activates an array
of downstream signaling cascades such as phosphoinositide-3kinase/Akt, focal adhesion kinase, and mitogen-activated protein
kinases which are involved in cell proliferation, tubular morphogenesis, cell motility, migration, and invasion (6–9). RON overexpression in patients with breast cancer is associated with a worse
clinical outcome (10), and is recognized as a target for molecular
therapy.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a naturally occurring yellow
pigment extracted from the rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa
(Linn). Curcumin is one of the promising chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic agents (11) and inhibits the proliferation of
tumor cells in vitro (12), and suppressing tumor formation in
various animal models (13–15). Numerous studies show that
curcumin’s anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects have
been attributed to its ability to inhibit transcription factors such as
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), EGR1, ETS2,
signal transducers and activators of transcription, etc., and serine/
threonine protein kinases, i.e., phosphorylase kinase, protein kinase
C, protamine kinase, pp60c-src tyrosine kinase, p44/42 mitogenactivated protein kinase, and c-Jun-NH2-kinase (16–21). Phase I
human trials have been performed showing that curcumin is welltolerated and lacks toxicity (22, 23).
We have recently shown that the RON ligand, MSP, promotes
the invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast
cancer cells, and also identified the regulatory elements that are
required for basal RON promoter activity and RON gene expression
(24). The aim of our current study is to investigate the efficacy of
curcumin on the regulation of RON tyrosine kinase in the invasive
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Our data shows that
curcumin could down-regulate RON expression significantly in
breast cancer cells. Furthermore, curcumin-mediated RON downregulation inhibited the MSP-induced invasion of both MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. We have identified two novel NFnB p65
subunit-binding sites on the RON promoter. Curcumin blocks RON
kinase expression by inhibiting the p65 protein expression and the
consequent inactivation of p65-mediated transactivation of the
RON promoter activity. Using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC),
a pharmacologic inhibitor of p65 as well as p65 small interfering
RNA (siRNA), we have further confirmed the role of p65 in the
regulation of RON tyrosine kinase and the MSP-associated invasion
of breast cancer cells. In summary, the present study identified
NFnB as a novel regulator of RON tyrosine kinase and RON could
be a novel pharmacologic target of curcumin in the blockade of
invasion of carcinoma cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells, treatment, and reagents. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast
carcinoma cells were cultured as described (24). Cells were treated with
DMSO or various concentrations (10, 20, 40 and 80 Amol/L) of curcumin
for 24 h before the assays. For PDTC experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were
seeded in six-well plates (2.5  105 cells/well) and treated with 25, 50,
and 100 Amol/L of PDTC for 24 h. Anti-RON and anti-actin polyclonal
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Anti-p65 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam. Anti-pIKKa/h
(Ser180/181), IKK-a, anti-IKK-h, anti-pInB-a, and anti-InB-a antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Curcumin was obtained from
MP Biomedicals. Recombinant MSP was purchased from R&D Systems.
PDTC was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were
from Bio-Rad Laboratories. All other reagents used were from SigmaAldrich.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the cells
treated with DMSO or curcumin using the Trizol method (Invitrogen).
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described previously
(24). Primers for RON generate a 246-bp fragment as follows: sense primers,
5¶-AGC CCA CGC TCA GTG TCT AT-3¶; and antisense primers, 5¶-GGG CAC
TAG GAT CAT CTG TCA-3¶. Primers for actin generate a 621-bp fragment as
follows: sense primers, 5¶-ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG-3¶; and
antisense primers, 5¶-AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT-3¶.
Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of cell lysates from cells treated
with DMSO, different concentrations of curcumin, or PDTC were used for
Western analysis.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The oligonucleotide containing
the consensus NFnB-binding site was end-labeled using 32P-ATP and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed on the nuclear
extracts from controls and varying concentrations of curcumin-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells as described previously (24).
Construction of 1.2 kb and 400 bp wild-type RON promoterluciferase reporter constructs. The 1.2 kb and 400 bp RON promoterluciferase reporter vectors were described previously (24).
Site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations in the RON promoter were
created in putative NFnB p65 binding sites at nucleotides 133 to 140
(site 1) and 156 to 162 (site 2) using the Quickchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For construction of site-directed mutants of
the RON promoter, the reporter vector containing the wild-type 1.2 kb and
400 bp RON promoter sequence was used as a template. To generate a site
1 mutant, we used primer A, 5¶-GAACCTGGGGCGGATGTCCGCTA TCTTG3¶; and primer B, 5¶-CAAGA TAGCGGACATCCGCCCCAGGTTC-3¶. The
mutant nucleotides are shown in italicized boldface. The same protocol was
used to create mutations in the site 2 region of the RON promoter. For
this PCR reaction, we used primer C, 5¶-CCGGGAAGGGATTTGATTTTCATCACAGG AACCTGG 3¶; and primer D, 5¶-CCAGGTTCCTGTGAAAATCAAATCCCTTCCCGG 3¶. The authenticity of mutation of all constructs
was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis.
Cell transfection and reporter gene assays. MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1.25  105
cells/well the day before transfection. Individually, 1 Ag of control vector,
pNFnB-Luc, RON promoter reporter vector, and RON mutant promoter
vector were transiently transfected into the cells with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). For p65-mediated RON reporter activity experiments, both the
pCMV-p65 and pGL3 RON Luc reporter vectors were cotransfected. Twentyfour hours following transfection, the cells were treated with either DMSO or
various concentrations of curcumin (10, 20, 40, and 80 Amol/L). After an
additional 24 h of incubation, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was
assayed. Control vector values were deducted from target promoterluciferase values and expressed as relative units following normalization to
protein levels.
siRNA knockdown experiments. NFnB p65 siRNA oligos were
purchased from Dharmacon Inc. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in
six-well plates were transfected with 50, 100, and 200 nmol/L of p65 siRNA
or scrambled siRNA oligos using HiPerFect transfection agent (Qiagen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then incubated for

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

65 h to allow maximum knockdown, after which they were harvested for
Western blot analysis as described above.
Invasion assay. Matrigel invasion experiments were performed as
described previously (24).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described elsewhere (25).
Oligonucleotide primers specific for the RON promoter spanning the
p65-binding sites ( forward, 5¶-CTC CAA GGG CCG GAA GAG TCG GAT
GG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TTA AGC AGC GGT CCC GAC AGC CCC AA-3¶) were used.
The PCR conditions were described previously (24).

Results
Curcumin decreases RON protein expression. To determine if
the chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent curcumin could
block RON protein expression, we treated MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells with varying concentrations of curcumin for
24 hours. We carried out Western analysis on equal amounts of
total cell lysates from control and curcumin-treated MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-468 cells using rabbit anti-human RON and actin
polyclonal antibodies. RON antibody recognizes the 170 kDa proRON and the intracellular 150 kDa h-chain of mature RON
receptor. The results in Fig. 1A show that curcumin can downregulate the expression of RON in a dose-dependent manner. In the
present study, we observed that 40 Amol/L of curcumin was able to
abolish the RON protein expression almost completely when
compared with untreated control in MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, curcumin-mediated RON down-regulation also occurred in
another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, suggesting that this
effect might not be a cell line–specific phenomenon. Although the
maximum effect of down-regulating RON in MDA-MB-231 cells was
achieved at 40 Amol/L of curcumin, it is achieved at 80 Amol/L in
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Under these conditions, the levels
of h-actin protein were unaffected, suggesting that the downregulation was specific to RON protein.
Curcumin blocks RON-mediated invasion of breast cancer
cells. We have recently shown that RON ligand, MSP, promotes the
invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (24).
Our Western analysis indicated that 80 Amol/L of curcumin
completely inhibited RON protein expression in both MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1A). To determine if curcuminmediated inhibition of RON protein expression blocks the RON
ligand, MSP-stimulated invasion, we carried out in vitro Matrigel
assays. We treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells for 24
hours either with 2.5 ng/mL of RON ligand MSP or 80 Amol/L of
curcumin alone or 2.5 ng/mL of MSP plus 80 Amol/L of curcumin.
Twenty-four hours later, the migrant cells were stained with crystal
violet and photographed (Fig. 1B). MSP induced the invasion
through Matrigel of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.
However, curcumin almost completely blocked the MSP-mediated
invasion of both the cell lines.
Curcumin down-regulates RON mRNA. We have carried out
RT-PCR analyses to determine if RON message levels reflect RON
protein expression. The cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468,
were treated with different doses of curcumin for 24 hours. Total
RNA from control and curcumin-treated cells was reversetranscribed into cDNA. We have performed a PCR analysis using
RON and actin primers (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Curcumin treatment dosedependently decreased RON mRNA expression in both cells
(Fig. 1C). When cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of curcumin,
an f45% and 25% decrease in RON mRNA levels was detected
in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, respectively, and reached a

maximum of nearly 3.8-fold at 80 Amol/L in both cells (Fig. 1C).
These results indicate that the decrease in RON protein expression
observed in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells was due to the
decrease in RON message levels following curcumin treatment.
Actin message levels were shown as a control.
Effect of curcumin on RON promoter activity. To determine
whether the decrease in RON expression levels following curcumin
treatment in the invasive breast cancer cells was due to decreased
RON transcription, we analyzed RON promoter activities using
the 1.2 kb full-length RON promoter in the absence/presence
of curcumin in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. We have
recently described the RON promoter construct (24). The RON
promoter lacks a distinct TATA box or CCAAT sequences. However,
it contains several GC boxes and consensus sequences for seven
Sp1-binding sites and we have shown that Sp1 is required for basal

RON promoter activity and RON gene expression. Now, using two
different software analyses (TFsearch, Genomatix) of the RON
promoter region, we have identified two putative NFnB p65binding sites at 133 bp and 156 bp relative to the transcription
start site. We refer to them as NFnB1 and NFnB2, respectively
(Fig. 1D). We have transiently transfected pGL3 control vector or
1.2 kb full-length RON promoter into MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells. Twenty-four hours following transfection, we treated
the cells with varying concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours and
analyzed the RON promoter activity. The luciferase activity of the
1.2 kb full-length RON promoter was approximately 12 times and
7 times higher than that of the pGL3 basic vector in MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1D; compare lane 1 versus lane 2).
Furthermore, cells transfected with 1.2 kb of RON promoter,
when incubated with varying amounts of curcumin for 24 hours,

curcumin-treated breast cancer cells
(3  104 cells/well) were plated in Matrigel
invasion chamber (top ) and treated cells
with 2.5 ng of MSP/mL for 24 h.
Twenty-four hours following incubation at
37jC, the cells on the surface of the
chamber were gently removed with cotton
swabs. The migrant cells on the
undersurface of the membrane were fixed
in 70% methanol and stained with crystal
violet. Images of the migrant cells were
captured by a photomicroscope (Nikon
Eclipse-TE-2000-U; magnification, 10).

displayed a gradual inhibition of the luciferase activity in a
dose-dependent manner and a maximum inhibition of 95% was
achieved at 80 Amol/L concentration in both cells. These results
show that the decrease in RON expression in curcumin-treated
cells was due to the decrease in RON transcription.
Effect of curcumin on NFKB p65 protein expression/activity.
One of the well-established biological effects of curcumin that is
potentially associated with its chemoprevention ability is the
inhibition of the NFnB pathway. Constitutive NFnB activity is
associated with enhanced proliferation and survival of malignant
cells. We have identified two putative NFnB p65 subunit binding
sites on the RON promoter. We have analyzed p65 protein levels
and p65 transcriptional activity to determine if a curcuminmediated decrease in p65 protein expression/transcriptional
activity was contributing to a decrease in RON protein levels in
the cells. We have treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
with varying concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours and carried
out Western analyses on equal amounts of cell lysates from control
and curcumin-treated cells (Fig. 2A). A curcumin dose-dependent
decrease in the p65 protein expression was observed in both cell
lines. To determine the effect of curcumin on NFnB p65 subunit
transcriptional activity, we have transiently transfected NFnB
cis-responsive element luciferase reporter construct or empty
control vector into MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Twentyfour hours following transfection, we treated the transfectants
with varying concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours and analyzed
the activity of NFnB cis-responsive element. A curcumin dosedependent decrease in NFnB cis-responsive element transcriptional activity was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). We
have performed gel shift analysis (EMSA) to determine the effects
of curcumin on NFnB binding activities. The oligonucleotidecontaining consensus NFnB binding site was end-labeled with
32
P-ATP, and EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

control and varying concentrations of curcumin-treated MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 2C). A curcumin dose-dependent decrease in the
NFnB binding activities was observed.
Effect of curcumin on ectopic p65-mediated RON expression. We next investigated whether forced expression of p65 would
stimulate the RON promoter activity as well as RON protein
expression. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were cotransfected with 1.2 kb RON promoter and increasing doses of pCMV
p65 and were assayed for RON promoter luciferase activity 48 hours
following transfection. The activity of 1.2 kb RON promoter in
both cells was effectively induced in a dose-dependent manner by
pCMV p65 (Fig. 3A). Even at a very low p65 concentration of 5 ng,
the expression of 1.2 kb RON promoter luciferase reporter activity
was induced by f5-fold and 7-fold in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB468 cells, respectively (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 versus lane 2).
Furthermore, increasing concentrations of p65 dramatically
increased the RON promoter activity and it peaked at a p65
concentration of 250 ng. In contrast, when cells were treated with
curcumin for 24 hours following cotransfection of 1.2 kb RON
promoter and 250 ng of p65, nearly the 17-fold induction of the
1.2 kb RON promoter mediated by p65 in both cells was almost
completely abolished (Fig. 3A, compare lane 5 versus lane 6). This
finding suggests that p65, a component of NFnB, could be a key
player in trans-activating the RON promoter and curcumin may
well down-regulate the p65-mediated RON promoter activity.
Because ectopic p65 dose-dependently increased RON promoter
activity, we investigated whether the transcriptional activation
of RON by p65 could affect RON protein expression. We have
transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with
CMV-control vector or varying amounts of pCMV p65 expression
plasmid. Twenty-four hours following transfection, one set of
transfectants were treated with 80 Amol/L of curcumin for
24 hours. Forty-eight hours following transfection of ectopic p65,

the p65 and RON protein expression levels in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells were detected by Western blot (Fig. 3B).
As expected, p65 protein levels were increased in cells transfected
with the p65 expression plasmid compared with the levels in cells
transfected with mock plasmid (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Interestingly,
although the basal level of RON expression in these cell lines is
high, the ectopic p65 at the tested concentrations of 500 ng and
1 Ag increased the RON expression significantly. Furthermore, we
examined whether curcumin could modulate the expression of
RON induced by ectopic p65. As shown in Fig. 3B, curcumin attenuated the p65-induced increase in RON protein which parallels
the increased p65 expression. These results highlight the fact that
curcumin may perhaps be a potent pharmacologic agent which
is capable of down-regulating RON through its ability to interfere
with the p65 component of NFnB binding to RON promoter.
In vivo binding of NFnB p65 to RON promoter. To show that
the NFnB p65 subunit binds to RON promoter in vivo, we have
carried out ChIP analysis with control IgG or p65 antibodies on the
chromatin fragments from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 4A). DNA from the immunoprecipitates was isolated
and PCR using primers covering the p65 binding sites on RON
promoter was performed on the isolated DNA and nonimmunoprecipitated starting material (input). RON was detected in the
input chromatin fragments from all three cell lines. However, an
accumulation of RON was detected in the p65 immunoprecipitates
from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells but not in MCF7 cells,
which we have recently shown to be null for RON expression (24).
RON was not detected in the control IgG immunoprecipitates,
demonstrating the specificity of p65-binding to the RON promoter.
Effect of p65-binding site mutations on RON promoter
activities in the invasive breast cancer cells. Using two different
computer analysis tools (TFSEARCH, Genomatix) on the promoter
region of RON, we have identified two putative binding sites for
NFnB p65: one at 133 bp and the other at 156 bp relative to the

transcription start site. We have referred to them as NFnB1 RON
and NFnB2 RON, respectively. To better evaluate the contribution
of NFnB to the activity of the RON promoter, the 1.2 kb fulllength and 400 bp RON promoter deletion constructs which
retains the two putative NFnB binding sites were mutated either
alone or in combination as given in Materials and Methods. The
wild-type, deletion, and mutant RON constructs were transiently
transfected individually into MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells,
and the RON promoter activity was evaluated after 48 hours.
It is interesting to note that the deletion of 800 bp upstream of
the 400 bp proximal promoter region did not affect the basal
RON promoter activity. This data suggests that the 400 bp RON
promoter contains all the necessary regulatory elements. Mutation
of the NFnB1 site in both the 1.2 kb full-length and 400 bp RON
promoter resulted in f30 and 35 times decrease in the promoter
activity against the basal transcriptional activity of RON in MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively (Fig. 4B, compare
lane 2 versus lane 3). In addition, mutating the NFnB2 site also
dramatically decreased the basal promoter activity (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 versus lane 4). The transfection of a double-mutant
construct almost totally abolished the basal promoter activity of
RON constructs, suggesting the fact that both NFnB sites could be
clearly involved in basal RON promoter activation in the breast
cancer cells.
PDTC or siRNA p65 knockdown blocks RON gene expression
and MSP-induced invasion of breast cancer cells. We have
shown that the NFnB p65 subunit could transcriptionally regulate
RON gene expression. We next determined whether NFnB p65 is
indeed necessary for regulating RON expression. PDTC, a potent
chemical inhibitor of activation of NFnB or siRNAs targeting
p65, was used to decrease p65 expression and the effect of
down-regulating p65 on RON protein expression was examined.
PDTC was shown to be specific in the inhibition of NFnB expression (26). When MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different

concentrations of PDTC, p65 levels were dose-dependently
decreased by PDTC, and to our interest, RON protein levels were
also significantly reduced when compared with the untreated
control cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, when MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with chemically synthesized siRNA pools directed
against p65, not only were the cellular p65 levels decreased
effectively, but the RON protein levels were also decreased, and this
decrease was dose-dependent as well (Fig. 5B). However, neither
DMSO (Fig. 5A) nor scrambled siRNA (Fig. 5B) modulated RON
expression. Consequently, these data strongly suggest that RON
tyrosine kinase receptor could be down-regulated by blocking the
p65 component of NFnB. To show the specificity of p65 siRNAmediated RON knockdown on the blockade of MSP-mediated
invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, we have expressed control
scrambled siRNA or p65 siRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells. Forty-eight
hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated
along with untreated control cells for the Matrigel assay, either in
the presence or absence of 2.5 ng of the RON ligand, MSP. MSP
promoted the invasion of untransfected control or scrambled
siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). However, p65 siRNA-transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited almost complete blockade in invasion
because RON expression was inhibited in these cells.

Discussion
In general, tumors exhibit higher tyrosine kinase activity in
comparison to normal tissues. This correlation is also reflective in
tumor cells versus normal epithelial cells. Receptor tyrosine kinases
modulate diverse processes involved in tumor progression and
metastasis. Consequently, receptor tyrosine kinases are viewed as
attractive targets for molecular therapy. An understanding of the
molecular alterations that facilitate tumor progression and metastasis will provide insight into approaches to optimize targeted
therapies. In this context, the role of the receptor tyrosine kinase
RON in human epithelial cell malignancies is currently under active
investigation. We have recently shown that the RON ligand, MSP,
promotes the invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells and also identified the critical regulatory elements
that are required for basal RON promoter activity and RON
gene expression (24). We have followed up those studies in this
article and showed that a chemopreventive agent, curcumin
(diferuloylmethane) can effectively block RON tyrosine kinase–
mediated invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.
RON is expressed at relatively low levels in normal epithelial cells
and is absent in fibroblasts. The levels of RON expression in

malignant epithelial cells was shown to be increased by several fold
in comparison to benign epithelium (27). RON expression was an
independent predictor of distant relapse in node-negative breast
cancer (28). Mammary-specific RON receptor overexpression
induced metastatic mammary tumors, which has been shown to
involve h-catenin activation (29). Our recent data clearly showed
that RON promotes MSP-stimulated invasion of MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells (24). The acquisition of invasive phenotype is
directly correlated to the expression of oncogenic RON tyrosine
kinase. These studies suggest that blocking RON expression will
have therapeutic benefits. RT-PCR and Western analysis indicated
that curcumin, a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent,
reduces RON message and RON protein in MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells, respectively (Fig. 1A and C). However, the decrease in
RON message was not due to the decrease in RON mRNA stability
(Supplemental Fig. S1). Most significantly, curcumin-mediated
down-regulation of RON expression resulted in the abrogation of
RON ligand, MSP-induced invasion of these breast cancer cells.
Previous reports indicated that curcumin also blocks the invasion
and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells through the inhibition of
matrix metalloproteinases (30, 31).
Overexpression and activation of RON in epithelial cancers in
contrast to normal epithelium suggests that cellular mechanisms
that control RON expression are dysregulated in primary tumors
and tumor cell lines. The RON gene promoter has been partially
characterized (24). The RON promoter lacks a distinct TATA box or
CCAAT sequence. However, it is GC-rich and contains consensus
sequences for seven Sp1-binding sites. We have recently shown that
out of these seven Sp1 sites, Sp1 site at 113 bp and an overlapping
Sp1 site at 94 bp relative to the transcription start site are
involved in the basal RON promoter activity and RON gene
expression (24). However, curcumin reduced RON expression
without affecting Sp1 expression levels or Sp1 transcriptional

activity (data not shown). This result was not surprising because it
was previously reported that curcumin did not affect Sp1 activity
(16, 32). Our data indicated that curcumin shows a dose-dependent
decrease in the RON promoter activity (Fig. 1D). Numerous studies
indicate that curcumin’s anticarcinogenic effects have been
attributed to its ability to inhibit transcription factors such as
NFnB and AP-1 (16, 33–35). Curcumin inhibits NFnB activation and
NFnB-regulated gene expression through inhibition of IKK
activation (21). We have seen similar results (Supplemental Fig. S3).
Using two different software programs (TFSearch, Genomatix),
we have identified two putative NFnB-binding sites at 133 bp and
156 bp relative to the transcription start site on the RON
promoter. There is one AP-1 binding site at 1183 bp relative to
the transcription start site. In vivo ChIP analysis clearly indicated
the binding of the NFnB p65 subunit to native RON promoters in
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells which express RON protein
(Fig. 4A). MCF-7 cells that do not express RON protein and are
noninvasive when stimulated with RON ligand, MSP, do not exhibit
the binding of NFnB p65 subunit to the RON promoter, thus
suggesting the authenticity of the two novel NFnB p65 subunit
binding sites on the RON promoter in the RON expression–positive
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. We have recently shown that
the 1.2 kb full-length and 400 bp RON promoter deletion
construct exhibited similar activities in MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells, suggesting that the 400 bp region of the promoter
contains all the necessary regulatory elements required for the
RON promoter activity and RON gene expression (24). The 400 bp
RON promoter region does not contain the AP-1 element, thus
ruling out the involvement of AP-1 in the regulation of RON gene
expression. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both the NFnB
binding sites at 133 bp and 156 bp are equally important in the
regulation of RON promoter activity (Fig. 4B). Phorbol ester, TPA,
an inducer of NFnB activity stimulated RON promoter activity

in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, which was effectively
blocked by curcumin (data not shown). Also, ectopic p65 induced
RON promoter activity, RON mRNA, and RON protein expression,
which was effectively abrogated by the curcumin treatment
(Fig. 3A and B; Supplemental Fig. S2).
Curcumin decreased the p65 protein expression as well as
p65-dependent NFnB cis-element transcriptional activity in both
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2A and B). The mechanism of p65 protein down-regulation following curcumin treatment
is unclear. One possibility is that curcumin treatment directly
or indirectly leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation of p65. Another possibility is that curcumin affects
the transcriptional regulation of p65 promoter. The decrease in
p65 protein levels was a consequence of the decrease in p65 mRNA
as reported previously in the curcumin-treated MDA-MB-231
cells (33). Studies using PDTC, a specific inhibitor of NFnB p65
subunit activity or siRNA-mediated p65 knockdown, confirmed the
requirement of p65 for RON gene expression (Fig. 5A). The loss of
p65 protein expression in the presence of PDTC might be the
consequence of the effects of PDTC on the inhibition of InB activity
(Supplemental Fig. S4) or due to the decrease in p65 mRNA as

the results presented in this report identified the NFnB p65 subunit
