BACKGROUND: A set of common cancer-related and treatment-related symptoms has been proposed for quality of care assessment
and clinical research. Using data from a large, multicenter, prospective study, the authors assessed the effects of disease site and
stage on the percentages of patients rating these proposed symptoms as moderate to severe. METHODS: The severity of 13 symptoms proposed to represent “core” oncology symptoms was rated by 3106 ambulatory patients with cancer of the breast, prostate,
colon/rectum, or lung, regardless of disease stage or phase of care; 2801 patients (90%) repeated the assessment 4 to 5 weeks later.
RESULTS: At the time of the initial assessment, approximately 33% of the patients reported  3 symptoms in the moderate-to-severe
range; 11 of the 13 symptoms were rated as moderate to severe by at least 10% of all patients and 6 were rated as moderate to severe
by at least 20% of those receiving active treatment. Fatigue/tiredness was the most severe symptom, followed by disturbed sleep,
pain, dry mouth, and numbness/tingling. More patients with lung cancer and patients receiving active treatment reported moderate
to severe symptoms. Percentages of symptomatic patients increased by disease stage, less adequate response to therapy, and declining Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The percentages of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms
were stable across both assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study support a core set of moderate to severe
symptoms that are common across outpatients with solid tumors, that can guide consideration of progression-free survival as a trial
outcome, and that should be considered in clinical care and in assessments of quality of care and treatment benefit. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The control of disease-related and treatment-related symptoms is an integral component of cancer care, and symptom
reduction is essential for patients with advanced disease. Substantial research has described the prevalence and severity of
cancer-related pain and has identified factors associated with its expression and the adequacy of its treatment.1-3 However,
patients with cancer often rate other symptoms, including fatigue, poor appetite, and disrupted sleep, as equally or even
more distressing4,5; reducing or delaying the onset of such symptoms would be a significant treatment benefit. Similarly,
progression-free survival is becoming a standard endpoint in oncology, yet the critical association between it and symptoms is difficult to estimate because the symptomatic status of patients who develop disease progression has not to our
knowledge been well defined.
Studies have identified various symptoms as commonly occurring and attributable both to the disease itself and to
the toxicities of cancer therapy,6,7 and there is great interest in having a set of “core” symptoms to guide oncology research6

and clinical care.8 A panel of symptom assessment experts
from the Center for Medical Technology Policy (CMTP)
has developed recommendations for a core set of common
cancer-related and treatment-related symptoms to be
included in adult oncology clinical effectiveness studies,
especially studies of patients with advanced disease or who
are undergoing aggressive therapy.9 The concept of a core
set of symptoms is supported by systematic reviews of
studies with large patient samples (both inpatients and
outpatients) and various disease sites.4,5 The CMTP panel
identified 12 common symptoms that affect patients to a
meaningful degree: anorexia, anxiety, constipation,
depression, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, insomnia, nausea,
pain, neuropathy, and vomiting.
In 2002, a National Institutes of Health State-ofthe-Science panel10 called for more data regarding the
occurrence and treatment of pain, depression, and fatigue in adequately powered prospective studies. In
response to this call, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) designed the large, multisite Symptom
Outcomes and Practice Patterns (SOAPP) study to
characterize common treatment-related and diseaserelated symptoms in oncology outpatient practice and
to identify the relative influence of factors such as disease site, disease stage, disease status, active treatment,
and performance status on patients’ symptomatic status.
Outpatients with cancers of high prevalence (breast,
colorectal, prostate, and lung) were selected for the current study.
We analyzed SOAPP data to characterize the prevalence of the core symptoms proposed by the CMTP panel
at moderate to severe levels across the 4 disease sites and to
examine clinical characteristics that influence symptom
severity. We hypothesized that symptoms would be substantially more severe in patients with progressive disease,
later-stage cancer, or worse performance status. We also
expected that, due to treatment toxicities, symptoms
would be worse for patients currently receiving cancer
therapy and that more patients with lung cancer would
report severe symptoms compared with patients in the
other 3 disease groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

From March 3, 2006 to May 19, 2008, a total of 3123
outpatients with invasive breast, colorectal, prostate, or
lung cancer were enrolled in the SOAPP study at any
point in the trajectory of their care. Patients were registered at 38 ECOG-affiliated institutions, including 6 aca4334

demic sites and 32 community clinics. To reduce
selection bias, each site devised an ECOG-approved
recruitment algorithm that was not biased toward symptom management issues. Eligible patients were aged  18
years, willing to complete the follow-up survey, and
judged by the study screener to have adequate cognitive
function to complete study surveys.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards at each registering institution. The protocol and case report forms are accessible at ecogsoapp.org.
Procedures

Patients were recruited at the time of check-in for their
clinic appointments and provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment. Basic clinical and demographic information, including disease stage, current
treatment, disease status, and ECOG performance status
(ECOG PS), was then collected by study staff, before the
clinician’s visit. ECOG PS is a physician-rated measure of
functional ability, ranging from 0 (fully functional) to 4
(completely disabled).11
Symptom assessment was completed at the time of
the initial visit and at a follow-up visit 28 to 35 days later.
Patients were asked to complete all questionnaire items
according to their experience during the preceding 24
hours. Patients who were too ill to complete the follow-up
questionnaire were given the option to mail the forms to
the treating clinic by day 42 after the initial visit.
Symptom Assessment

Patients reported symptom intensity using an expanded
version of the 19-item M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).12 Symptoms are rated “at their worst” in
the previous 24 hours on an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“not present”) to 10 (“as bad as you can imagine”). For the SOAPP study, diarrhea, constipation, sore
mouth, rash, hair loss, and coughing were added to the 13
MDASI symptoms. Of these, diarrhea and constipation
comprised the 2 remaining proposed core symptoms from
the CMTP panel.
In this report, we focused on 13 of the 19 symptoms
assessed in the SOAPP study: the 12 symptoms suggested
by the CMTP group9 (fatigue [MDASI fatigue/tiredness],
insomnia [MDASI disturbed sleep], pain, anxiety
[MDASI distress], neuropathy [MDASI numbness/tingling], dyspnea [MDASI shortness of breath], anorexia
[MDASI lack of appetite], depression [MDASI sadness],
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) plus xerostomia (MDASI dry mouth), which systematic reviews
reported as highly prevalent.4,5

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics present estimates of the prevalence of
moderate to severe symptoms across disease sites (breast,
colorectal, prostate, and lung) and in the presence of other
variables, including current therapy (yes or no), ECOG
PS (0, 1, or 2-4), disease status (complete remission, partial remission, stable disease, or progressive disease), and
disease stage (no evidence of disease [NED], locoregional,
metastatic, or locoregional/metastatic). Chi-square tests
were used for subgroup comparisons. The chi-square test
for trend was used to test the overall trend of change in the
percentage of moderate to severe symptoms by change in
disease stage, disease status, and ECOG PS. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. All P values
were 2-sided and a P value < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Stata statistical software (version 11.2)
was used for all data analysis.13
We defined a moderate to severe symptom as one
rated  5 on the MDASI’s scale of 0 to 10, on the basis of
results from various studies, primarily of cancer-related
pain. “Pain at its worst” rated  5 causes disproportionately
greater interference with function, as measured in patients
with cancer14,15 and community samples.16 Although the
cutpoint used to delineate “moderate to severe” has varied
somewhat across studies and even among symptoms (ranging from 4 to 6), we reasoned that using 5 across the board
would be a simplifying compromise that offered analytical
consistency across all symptoms.
RESULTS
Of the 3123 patients enrolled, 3106 completed the initial
MDASI and were included in the current analysis. The
sample included 1544 patients with breast cancer (50%),
718 patients with colorectal cancer (23%), 320 patients
with prostate cancer (10%), and 524 patients with lung
cancer (17%) (Table 1). The median age was 61 years.
The sample was predominantly white (86%), nonHispanic (90%), and female (70%). The median time
from the initial cancer diagnosis to study registration was
1.2 years; 2299 patients (74%) were receiving cancer
treatment. At the follow-up assessment, 2801 patients
completed the MDASI; retention rates were 90% for
patients with breast cancer, 93% for patients with colorectal cancer, 90% for patients with prostate cancer, and
87% for patients with lung cancer.

achieved a complete response (all P < .05). Patients with an
ECOG PS  2 were highly symptomatic. The percentages
of patients with an ECOG PS of 1 reporting moderate to
severe symptoms were significantly greater than the percentages of patients with an ECOG PS of 0 reporting moderate to severe symptoms (P < .001 for all 13 symptoms).

percentages were significantly higher for patients receiving
treatment (both P < .001) (Table 3). Significantly more
patients receiving treatment also reported moderate to
severe nausea, lack of appetite, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation (all P < .05). Prior systemic therapy was associated with increased pain (16.1%
vs 21.4%; P < .001) and numbness/tingling (15.1% vs
21.6%; P < .001).

Symptom Severity at Follow-Up

In the aggregate, severity ratings made by patients at the
follow-up visit were similar to those made at the time of the
initial assessment, even though many individual patients
did demonstrate changes in symptom ratings between the 2
visits. For all disease sites, the change in the percentages of
patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms was within
5.4%. The largest discrepancy between baseline and
follow-up was an increase in patients with lung cancer
reporting moderate to severe pain. The majority of the top
5 symptoms remained consistent over time, in all patients
as a group and by disease site, current therapy, disease stage,
disease status, and ECOG PS (Table 5).

By Disease Stage, Disease Status, and ECOG PS

Overall, the percentage of patients reporting each symptom as moderate to severe increased as the disease stage
worsened (Table 4). However, > 20% of patients with
NED reported moderate to severe fatigue/tiredness and
disturbed sleep.
A similar pattern of increasing symptom severity was
noted when patients were characterized by disease status
and ECOG PS (Table 4). Higher percentages of patients
with stable or progressive disease reported moderate to
severe levels for all symptoms compared with patients who

Core Set of Cancer-Related Symptoms/Cleeland et al

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study illustrate that patients
with cancer are at risk for experiencing multiple moderate
to severe symptoms simultaneously and support the use of
routine clinical screening for a core set of symptoms in
addition to pain, especially for patients receiving active
treatment, those with diminished ECOG PS, or those
with metastatic disease.
Greater than 25% (prostate cancer) to nearly 50%
(lung cancer) of the sample rated  3 core symptoms as
moderate to severe. Fatigue/tiredness was rated as moderate to severe by the greatest percentages of patients across
the 4 disease groups. Disturbed sleep and pain also were
prevalent. Dry mouth, which was not among the core
symptoms proposed by the CMTP,9 was among the most
frequent moderate to severe symptoms reported in the
current study. Numbness/tingling was second in prevalence for patients with colorectal cancer, and most likely is
a product of the neurotoxic therapies used to treat this
cancer type. Although moderate to severe nausea was
reported by >10% of patients with an ECOG PS of > 0
or metastatic disease, vomiting was rarely reported. Overall, 11 of the 12 CMTP symptoms (excluding vomiting)
were rated as moderate or severe by  10% of at least 1 of
the disease groups, suggesting that they are candidates for
routine clinic screening.
Although individual patients demonstrated an
improvement or worsening of their symptoms between
the initial and follow-up assessments, the overall percentages of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms
for each disease group and by disease stage, disease status,
and ECOG PS were quite stable between the 2 assessments. The stability of the ratings supports the representativeness of the selected symptoms and their ordering by
severity.
Expectations for associations between greater symptom burden and more advanced disease, poor response to
therapy, poor ECOG PS ( 2), and lung cancer were supported by the data. Less expected was the substantial
symptomatic difference noted between patients with an
ECOG PS of 1 (ambulatory, able to perform light work)
and those with an ECOG PS of 0 (fully active). At least
20% of patients with an ECOG PS of 1 reported moderate to severe levels for 9 of the 13 symptoms, as opposed
to only 2 symptoms (fatigue/tiredness and disturbed
sleep) for those with an ECOG PS of 0. This suggests that
performance status may need to be included as a stratification or eligibility factor in addition to disease status and
stage in trials in which change in symptom status is a
variable of interest. In contrast to results from previous
Cancer

studies,1,17 we found no differences in symptom severity
by patient sex (data not shown).
Our use of a fixed cutpoint of  5 to define a moderate to severe symptom is a potential limitation. Others
have suggested that different symptoms may become
moderate to severe at different ratings on a scale of 0 to
10.18 Practice guidelines for the management of cancerrelated pain, fatigue, and distress19 suggest that these
symptoms are moderate when rated as 4. It is not our
intention to indicate that symptoms rated < 5 are not
clinically significant and do not warrant clinical care; we
chose a cutpoint of 5 because it was not likely to exclude
those patients with significant symptoms. More research
on cutpoints for severity ratings across symptoms is
needed.
Second, we did not factor in comorbid conditions
(such as arthritis or cardiovascular disease) that may have
contributed to symptom burden. However, it is likely that
any such comorbid conditions would have equally
affected the cancer-free patients (those with NED) in this
sample, > 10% of whom rated 7 of the 13 symptoms as
moderate or severe (Table 4). Similarly, we purposely
made no attempt to attribute symptoms to treatment or
disease, because making such attribution is difficult at best
and unreliable at worst.6,20
Finally, we restricted our investigation to the 12 core
symptoms recommended by the CMTP expert panel9 and
1 additional symptom (dry mouth) that was shown to be
prevalent in 2 extensive systematic reviews.4,5 The SOAPP
data were generally consistent with the systematic reviews
and supported the CMTP core symptom list with the
exception of vomiting, which was rarely reported, even by
the patients with the most advanced disease. In addition,
the high percentage of patients reporting moderate to
severe dry mouth suggests that it is a candidate for inclusion in a core list. MDASI symptoms not identified as
prevalent by either the CMTP panel or the systematic
reviews, and therefore not included in the current analysis,
were drowsiness and difficulty remembering. These symptoms were rated as moderate to severe by 22.9% and
17.2% of patients, respectively, in the SOAPP sample,
indicating that they also may warrant inclusion in a core
list. It is possible that other symptoms not contemplated
here could be prevalent at moderate to severe levels in
patients with cancer. Future studies may resolve such discrepancies; notwithstanding, we believe that the 12 symptoms corroborated in the current study form a reliable
representation of symptom burden that would aid qualityof-care evaluations and clarify the patient’s perspective on
the symptomatic consequences of disease progression.

It is increasingly routine to have patients rate pain
on a scale of 0 to 10 at clinic visits. Adding a limited number of core symptoms would not appreciably increase
patient burden, and doing so might capture symptoms
that are even more distressing than pain and could provide
clinical teams with more robust information with which
to understand the patient within the context of cancer
care, especially if high levels of symptoms are documented
and trigger an evaluation and management plan.8
