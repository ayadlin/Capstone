Abstract
The identification of the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment
of the resistant phenotype represents a critical need for the development of new
strategies to prevent or overcome cancer resistance to anti-neoplastic treatments.
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, and
resistance to chemotherapy negatively affects patient outcomes. Here, we investigated
the potential role of miR-302b in the modulation of breast cancer cell resistance to
cisplatin.
miR-302b overexpression enhances sensitivity to cisplatin in breast cancer cell
lines, reducing cell viability and proliferation in response to the treatment. We also
identified E2F1, a master regulator of the G1/S transition, as a direct target gene
of miR-302b. E2F1 transcriptionally activates ATM, the main cellular sensor of DNA
damage. Through the negative regulation of E2F1, miR-302b indirectly affects ATM
expression, abrogating cell-cycle progression upon cisplatin treatment. Moreover
miR-302b, impairs the ability of breast cancer cells to repair damaged DNA, enhancing
apoptosis activation following cisplatin treatment.
These findings indicate that miR-302b plays a relevant role in breast cancer cell
response to cisplatin through the modulation of the E2F1/ATM axis, representing a
valid candidate as therapeutic tool to overcome chemotherapy resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Patients usually display a good initial response to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, drug resistance
is a fundamental problem in breast cancer management,
and is responsible for most cases of treatment failure
in patients with metastatic cancer [4, 5]. Cisplatin
cytotoxicity to normal tissues and cancer cell acquired
resistance reduce the clinical efficacy of this drug [6].
However, the molecular mechanisms determining breast
cancer resistance to this drug still remain not completely
understood.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (19-22 nucleotide)
non-coding RNAs known to alter gene expression at the

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in women [1]. Clinically, this heterogeneous
disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes:
Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 type and triple-negative/
basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
constitutes approximately 15 to 20% of all breast cancer
cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes [2]. For
patients affected by TNBC, targeted therapies are not
available and chemotherapy has a limited duration of
effect in later stages of the disease [3].

post-transcriptional level [7, 8]. MicroRNA expression
profiling was shown to be associated with tumor
development, progression and response to therapy,
suggesting their possible use as diagnostic, prognostic
and predictive biomarkers [9]. Presumably, miRNAs
evolved to allow organisms and cells to effectively deal
with cellular stress[10]. Recent studies demonstrated
that a single miRNA can impact hundreds of targets [11],
and that multiple miRNAs can affect a single target [12],
pointing out to the broad implications of miRNAs in
the modulation of important cellular processes. Indeed,
several experimental and clinical findings have also
implicated miRNAs in the response to chemotherapy
[13], demonstrating a role for miRNAs in the modulation
of genes involved in DNA repair [14, 15].
The miR-302 cluster, which consists of miR-302a,
-302a*, -302b, -302b* -302c, -302c*, -302d, -367 and
-367*, was first found to be functionally correlated with
self-renewal and proliferation properties in the stemness
maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [16, 17].
Furthermore, tumor-related miRNA studies proved
the potential role of miR-302b as tumor-suppressor in
different cancer models [18-25]. miR-302b is also reported
to be down modulated, compared to normal tissues, in
breast cancer [26]. Recently, by microarray analysis,
miR-302b was identified as closely associated with

the occurrence and development of breast cancer [27].
Moreover, Liang Z. et al. demonstrated that miR-302a
sensitized radioresistant breast cancer cells to radiation
therapy in vitro and in vivo and reduced the expression of
AKT1 and RAD52 [28].
In a previous work, we demonstrated that miR-302b
represents a biomarker in human ovarian carcinoma cells
able to predict response to cisplatin treatment [29]. In this
study we aimed to demonstrate that miR-302b sensitizes
breast cell lines to cisplatin treatment by regulating E2F1
expression and cellular DNA Damage Response (DDR)
mechanisms.

RESULTS
miR-302b sensitizes breast cancer cell lines to
cisplatin treatment
Our previous findings demonstrated that high levels
of miR-302b represent a predictive biomarker for the
response to cisplatin treatment of ovarian cancer cells.
Moreover, reduced levels of miR-302b in breast cancer
tumors suggest a potential role for this microRNA as a
tumor suppressor. Based on these observations, we first

aimed to assess the ability of miR-302b to mediate breast
cancer sensitivity to cisplatin.
To this aim, MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were
transiently transfected with miR-302b precursor or
scrambled control (miR-302b and scr). Forty-eight hours
following transfection, cells were treated with cisplatin
(100µM) or left untreated for 4 or 24 hours. Transfection
efficiency was evaluated by RealTime PCR as shown in
Supplementary Figure 1A. As shown in Figure 1A, miR302b transfection enhanced breast cancer cell sensitivity to
cisplatin. Similar results were also obtained using different
TNBC (BT549) and luminal breast cancer (T47D) cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C), indicating that
miR-302b modulates cisplatin resistance in different in
vitro models of breast cancer. MTS assay performed on
MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed the inhibitory effects of
miR-302b on cell growth following cisplatin treatment
(Figure 1B).
To further confirm that miR-302b overexpression

enhances cisplatin sensitivity of breast cancer cells, colony
assay was also performed. MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with miR-302b expression vector or with the
corresponding empty vector, and treated with cisplatin for
4 and 24 hours. As shown in Figure 1C-1D, a significant
reduction in the number of colonies was observed when
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-302b,
compared to empty-transfected cells, following cisplatin
treatment.
These results demonstrate that miR-302b sensitizes
breast cancer cells to cisplatin treatment.

miR-302b directly targets E2F1
To identify the mechanisms by which miR-302b
sensitizes breast cancer cells to cisplatin treatment, we
performed an in silico analysis of the potential target genes
of this microRNA. TargetScan algorithm (www.targetscan.

org) identified E2 transcriptor factor 1 (E2F1) as predicted
target gene for miR-302b (Figure 2A). The E2F family of
transcription factors plays a crucial role in the control of
cell proliferation, regulating the expression of many genes
required for entry and progression through the S phase of
the cell cycle [30]. Moreover, E2F1 protein is stabilized
and its levels are increased in response to DNA damage
[31-33].
As shown in Figure 2B-2C, miR-302b
overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in the
decrease of E2F1 expression both at the mRNA (Figure
2B) and protein (Figure 2C) levels.
To demonstrate the direct targeting of E2F1 3’-UTR
by miR-302b, a luciferase reporter assay was performed.
To this aim, the 3’-UTR region of E2F1 including
the predicted binding site for miR-302b was cloned
downstream the luciferase reporter gene. MDA-MB-231
cells were co-transfected with miR-302b precursor or
scrambled negative control and the reporter vector. As
shown in Figure 2D, a significant decrease in luciferase
activity was observed in miR-302b transfected cells as

compared to scrambled transfected cells. Of note, deletion
of the miR-302b binding site on the E2F1 3’-UTR reporter
vector (Figure 2A) partially rescued the inhibitory effect
of miR-302b on luciferase expression (Figure 2D).
Taken together, these findings indicate that E2F1 is
a new target of miR-302b.

miR-302b regulates ATM through E2F1
ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated) is one of the
most important serine/theronine kinase that transduces
DNA damage signals to downstream mediators involved
in the cellular DDR [34, 35]. ATM is primarily activated
in response to DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs)
due to cisplatin treatment, mediating cell cycle arrest,
repair of damaged DNA and cellular apoptosis [14]. It
was previously demonstrated that E2F1 activates ATM
promoter activity, resulting in increased ATM mRNA
and protein levels [36]. Since miR-302b negatively
regulates E2F1, we hypothesized that up-regulation of

this microRNA could result in reduced transcriptional
activation of ATM promoter. Accordingly, we observed
a significant decrease of both ATM mRNA and protein
levels when miR-302b was expressed in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 3A and 3B). However, in silico analysis
of ATM 3’UTR did not identify potential binding sites
for miR-302b (data not shown). Then, we hypothesized
that miR-302b could indirectly affect ATM expression
through E2F1. To validate this hypothesis, we performed a
luciferase assay by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with
a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under
the transcriptional control of human ATM gene [36] in the
presence of miR-302b precursor or a scrambled negative

control. Figure 3C shows that the transcriptional activity
of ATM promoter was significantly reduced by miR302b transfection compared to scrambled transfected
cells (Figure 3C). To confirm that miR-302b-mediated
regulation of ATM gene expression was dependent on
E2F1 transcriptional activity, MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with miR-302b precursor or a scrambled
negative control following transfection of E2F1
expression vector (not including its 3’-UTR) or its empty
negative control (Supplementary Figure 2A-2B). Real
Time analysis confirmed the down regulation of ATM
expression following miR-302b transfection. Conversely,
exogenous expression of E2F1 rescued the expression of

ATM also in the presence of miR-302b.
Finally, we demonstrated that miR-302b negatively
regulates E2F1 and, indirectly, ATM, using two different
cellular models of breast cancer, BT-549 (TNBC) and
T47D (luminal breast cancer). As shown in Supplementary
Figure 2C-2E, exogenous expression of miR-302b resulted
in downregulation of E2F1 and ATM also in these systems.
Taken together, these data indicate that miR-302b,
by targeting E2F1, negatively affects ATM expression
levels in breast cancer cells of different origin.

cancer cells were transiently transfected with miR-302b
precursor or scrambled negative control, treated for 4h
with cisplatin, collected at 24h from the treatment and
analyzed by flow-cytometry following propidium-iodide
staining. No significant alteration of cell cycle distribution
was observed between untreated miR-302b-transfected or
scrambled-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely,
following cisplatin treatment, miR-302b-transfected cells
displayed a higher accumulation in the S phase of the cell
cycle higher compared to negative control-transfected
cells (61% vs 50%). Similar results were obtained using
BT549 cells following miR-302b transfection and cisplatin
treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). These results indicate
that overexpression of miR-302b inhibits cell-cycle
transition through S-phase following cisplatin treatment
of breast cancer cells.

miR-302b affects cell cycle progression after
cisplatin treatment
Since E2F1 regulates cell proliferation by
modulating S-phase entry and progression, we decided
to investigate the potential role of miR-302b in cell cycle
control in response to cisplatin treatment. MDA-MB-231

miR-302b overexpression impairs Homologus
Recombination and Non-Homologus End Joining
DNA repair mechanisms

Accordingly, as shown in Figure 6B and 6C, western
blot analysis of MDA-MB-231 transiently transfected
with miR-302b and treated with cisplatin 24h showed a
significant PARP degradation and Caspase-3 activation
compared to scrambled negative control transfected cells.
These results demonstrated that miR-302b
overexpression enhances cisplatin sensibility of breast
cancer cells, by inducing apoptosis.

Our data so far demonstrated that miR-302b
overexpression in breast cancer cell lines leads to
sensitization to cisplatin treatment, by targeting E2F1
and ATM. Since ATM plays a key role in the molecular
mechanisms of DNA repair, we also investigated whether
miR-302b overexpression could result in the impairment
of these mechanisms, cycle checkpoint activation and,
eventually, apoptosis or senescence [37]. Following
DNA DSBs, the two major pathways involved in DNA
repair are Homologous Recombination (HR) and NonHomologous End Joining (NHEJ) [38]. We evaluated
the effects of miR-302b overexpression on both DDR
mechanisms using two established assays based on HeLa
derived cells (HeLa-DR 13-9 and HeLa-EJ-5 for HR
and NHEJ, respectively) with the specific recombination
substrate DNA integrated in the genome to study each
DSB repair pathway [39, 40]. In both systems, if HRmediated or NHEJ DNA-repair occurs, the recombination
generates an active GFP allele that can be revealed by
detection and quantification of green-fluorescent cells. We
transfected HeLa-DR13-9 and HeLa-EJ5 cells with either
a miR-302b precursor or scrambled control and, two days
later, with plasmid encoding for the I-SceI endonuclease
to induce DNA damage. The percentage of GFP-positive
cells (reflecting the efficiency of HR-mediated and NHEJ
DNA-repair) was then assessed by flow cytometry at 72
h after the second transfection. As shown in Figure 5A
and 5B, miR-302b expression resulted in about 30%
and 15% reduction of GFP-positive cells. RNA was
extracted from HeLa-DR13-9 cells to verify miR-302b
transfection and down-regulation of E2F1 and ATM
mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure 4). All together
these results indicate that miR-302b improve sensitivity
to chemotherapy in breast cancer cell lines negatively
affecting DNA-repair.

DISCUSSION
Breast cancer patients usually have a good initial
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy but the
insurgence of drug resistance represents one of the major
causes of treatment failure, especially for patients with
metastatic disease [4, 5].
A growing body of evidence demonstrated a
correlation between miRNAs expression and tumor
chemo- and radiosensitivity [28, 41, 42], further
supporting the strong clinical relevance of microRNAs.
In a previous study, we demonstrated that miR-302b
acts as chemo-sensitizer in human ovarian carcinoma cell
lines by targeting HDAC4, and may represent a biomarker
able to predict response to cisplatin [29].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role
of miR-302b in the modulation of breast cancer cell
sensitivity to cisplatin, also investigating the molecular
mechanisms affected by this microRNA and involved in
cancer cell resistance to these treatments.
Here, we first analyzed cisplatin sensitivity of
three different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231
and BT549 (triple negative) and T47D (luminal), upon
miR-302b overexpression. Our results indicate that miR302b overexpression induces a significant decrease of cell
viability and proliferation following cisplatin treatment
in different breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that miR302b could play an important role in mediating cisplatin
sensitivity of both TNBC and luminal breast cancer cells.
In silico analysis allowed us to the identify E2F1, a
master regulator of the G1/S transition, as a new potential
miR-302b target. Our experimental data demonstrated that
miR-302b negatively modulates E2F1 expression at both
mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase assays confirmed the
direct targeting of E2F1 3’-UTR by miR-302b. However,
mutation of E2F1 3’-UTR sequence in the potential miR302b target site only partially abrogated miR-302b control
of E2F1 expression, suggesting that other non-canonical
binding sites for this microRNA could be present.
Accordingly with the role of E2F1 in the control of
cell-cycle progression, we confirmed that down-regulation
of this protein upon miR-302b overexpression results in
a slower transition through the S-phase of the cell cycle,
following cisplatin treatment. Of note, major alterations of
the cell cycle progression were not observed in untreated
cells, suggesting that other factors, such as the other
members of the E2F family, might compensate for the

miR-302b overexpression and cisplatin treatment
induce apoptosis
We have demonstrated that miR-302b sensitizes
breast cancer cell lines to cisplatin treatment by targeting
directly E2F1 and indirectly ATM, reducing cell growth. To
evaluate whether miR-302b expression could also activate
apoptosis in response to cisplatin treatment, we performed
Caspase 3/7 activation following transient transfection of
miR-302b in MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Figure
6A, significant Caspase activation induction was observed
at 4 and 24 hours upon cisplatin treatment (Figure 6A).
Similarly, miR-302b overexpression resulted in enhanced
Caspase 3/7 activation also in BT549 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5).

absence of E2F1 following miR-302b overexpression.
However, following cisplatin treatment, the stronger
accumulation in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle mediated
by miR-302b suggests the presence of specific molecular
pathways relying on E2F1.
It has been widely demonstrated that E2F1 elevates
ATM promoter activity and enhances ATM mRNA and
protein levels [36]. This protein activates a signaling
cascade that leads to the immediate triggering of DNArepair mechanisms, [34, 43] and it is primarily activated in
response to DSBs due to cisplatin treatment [14]. Usually,
cells activate multiple DNA repair mechanisms to remove
cisplatin-damaged DNA. These DNA repair systems are
detrimental to the cytotoxic efficacy of the drug. Indeed,
increased DNA repair capacity of cancer cells is a key
mechanism involved in cisplatin resistance [44]. Since our
data demonstrated that miR-302b directly targets E2F1, we
also analyzed ATM expression. Interestingly we found that
miR-302b negatively regulates ATM expression indirectly,
at least in part through the direct down-regulation of E2F1
expression. In the presence of higher levels of miR-302b,
reduced levels of E2F1 result in the partial abrogation of
ATM activation, affecting cancer cell ability to repair DNA
and proliferate. Accordingly, here we show that exogenous
expression of miR-302b negatively affects the ability of
breast cancer cells to repair damaged DNA by NHEJ and
HR, which suggests that miR-302b correspond to cellular
alteration following DNA-damaging agents treatment.
Consequently, down-regulation of ATM-dependent
mechanisms of DDR leads to enhanced cell death
following cisplatin treatment. In fact, our results show
apoptosis activation following miR-302b overexpression
and cisplatin treatment, as indicated by Caspase-3 and
PARP cleavage.
The advantage of miRNAs is their ability to
affect multiple targets with a single hit, thus resulting a
whole network of interacting molecules. However, we
found that miR-302b, through the negative regulation
of E2F1, targets ATM and we could confirm that miR302b replacement therapy might enhance sensitivity
to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells, targeting genes
involved in mechanisms such as cell cycle and DDR
frequently altered in cancer.
In conclusion our study demonstrates that miR302b overexpression increases sensitivity of breast cancer
cell lines to cisplatin by targeting E2F1 and ATM, further
compromising the control of cell-cycle progression and
DDR mechanisms.
These findings indicate that miR-302b might
represent a biomarker to predict response to cisplatin
treatment in breast cancer patients, supporting this
microRNA as potential therapeutic tool to overcome
chemotherapy resistance.

(Invitrogen) was added at the final concentration of 500
μg/mL. Three weeks after the onset of drug selection,
colonies were stained with crystal violet acquired using
the QuantityOne software (Biorad) and counted. Data are
representative of one experiment performed in triplicate
and mean + SD is reported. Statistical significance was
analyzed by the unpaired Student t-test.

Protein extraction and western blots were performed
as previously described [47]. Protein concentration was
detected with Bradford method. The antibodies used were:
anti-E2F1 (sc-251, Santa Cruz Inc), anti-ATM (sc-23921,
Santa Cruz Inc), anti-PARP (9532, Cell Signaling), antiCaspase-3 (9662, Cell Signaling) anti-β actin (sc-47778,
Santa Cruz Inc), anti-vinculin (sc-73614, Santa Cruz Inc).

Apoptosis assay

Plasmid construction

Apoptosis was quantified using Caspase-Glo
3/7 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions on a Bio-Tek Synergy HT multi detection
microplate reader. The assay was performed three times
in triplicate and the mean + S.D. was reported. Statistical
significance was analyzed by the unpaired Student t-test.

The E2F1 3′ untranslated region (UTR) reporter
construct, including the binding site for miR-302b and
cloned into the pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison,
WI) downstream of the luciferase gene was previously
described [45]. Mutations of the miR-302b binding site
in the E2F1 3′-UTR were introduced using the QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Primers for plasmid construction and mutagenesis
were:

FACS analysis
Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS and fixed
in 70% ethanol for 2h at -20°. After fixation, cells were
washed in PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm.
Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 10mg/ml
propidium iodide (Roche) and incubated for 20 min at
37°C. Cells were analyzed using FACS-Calibur flow
cytometer and the results were further analyzed with the
ModFit software, v3.2 (Verity Software House). The assay
was performed three times in triplicate and the mean +
S.D. was reported. Statistical significance was analyzed
by the unpaired Student t-test.

References

HR (Homologous Recombination) and NHEJ
(Non-Homologous End Joining) assays were performed
as previously described [39, 40]. Briefly, HeLA-DR13-9
or HeLa-EJ-5 cells were transfected with 30pmol of hsamiR-302b-3p Pre-miRTM miRNA Precursor (Ambion)
or Pre-miRTM Negative Control #1 (Ambion). On day 2,
cells were transferred to 35 mm dishes. On day 3, cells
were transfected with 50 pmol of hsa-miR-302b-3p PremiRTM miRNA Precursor (Ambion) or Pre-miRTM Negative
Control #1 (Ambion) along with I-SceI expression vector
to induce DNA DSB. On day 6, cells were harvested
and GFP positive cells were counted using a FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). For each
experimental point, at least 10,000 cells were analyzed.
Data are representative of two independent experiments
performed in triplicate and mean + SD is reported.
