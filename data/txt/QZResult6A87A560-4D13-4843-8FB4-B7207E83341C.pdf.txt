Abstract
Many of the gene mutations found in genetic disorders, including cancer, result in premature termination
codons (PTC) and the rapid degradation of their mRNAs by nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). We used virtual
library screening, targeting a pocket in the SMG7 protein, a key component of the NMD mechanism, to identify
compounds that disrupt the SMG7–UPF1 complex and inhibit NMD. Several of these compounds upregulated
NMD-targeted mRNAs at nanomolar concentrations, with minimal toxicity in cell-based assays. As expected,
pharmacologic NMD inhibition disrupted SMG7–UPF1 interactions. When used in cells with PTC-mutated p53,
pharmacologic NMD inhibition combined with a PTC "read-through" drug led to restoration of full-length p53
protein, upregulation of p53 downstream transcripts, and cell death. These studies serve as proof-of-concept that
pharmacologic NMD inhibitors can restore mRNA integrity in the presence of PTC and can be used as part of a
strategy to restore full-length protein in a variety of genetic diseases. Cancer Res; 74(11); 3104–13. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Human genetic disorders are caused by diverse types of
mutations. Many of these mutations, including nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and mutations that cause alternative splicing events, result in premature termination codons
(PTC). For example, approximately 15% of the mutations
leading to Duchenne muscular dystophy, 10% of the mutations
responsible for cystic ﬁbrosis, and common b-globin mutations
responsible for thalassemia are PTC mutations (1–3). It has
been estimated that up to 30% of all mutations resulting in
human genetic disorders result in PTCs (4). In addition, many
acquired mutations in cancer, including those that disable p53
and BRCA1, ATM, VHL, and NF1 and NF2, result in PTCs (5).
Many transcripts carrying a PTC are targeted for rapid
degradation before they can be translated into protein through
a multistep process termed nonsense-mediated RNA decay
(NMD). The molecular mechanism of NMD has not been fully
delineated, though working models have been proposed. During the processing of mammalian pre-mRNA, introns are
excised and marked by a multiprotein exon junction complex
(EJC; refs. 6–8). When the translation complex pauses at a PTC
that is upstream of an EJC, eukaryotic release factors recruit

the RNA helicase UPF1, a vital component of the NMD mechanism (9). UPF1 then associates with UPF2, a component of the
EJC, and is phosphorylated at several sites by SMG1 (10).
Phosphorylated UPF1 recruits SMG7 and SMG5, two 14-3-3
proteins that each bind to UPF1 and form a heterodimer, and
results in the dephosphorylation of UPF-1 by PP2A (11, 12). The
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of UPF1 are necessary
steps before the degradation of the transcript by exonucleases
(12, 13).
One approach to treat genetic disorders and to restore
tumor-suppressor genes with PTC mutations is to pharmacologically promote ribosomes to read-through a PTC and produce a full-length protein (14). For example, treating cells with
the antibiotic gentamicin increases the full-length expression
of both PTC-mutated b-globin and PTC-mutated p53 (15, 16).
Gentamicin treatment of cells with PTC mutations of the cystic
ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) can
increase cellular chloride transport (17, 18) and patients with
PTC mutations treated with intranasal gentamicin increase
CFTR protein expression and improve the potential difference
of nasal epithelial cells (19). Although application of gentamicin or the closely related geneticin (G418) is not practical
clinically, a recent high-throughput screen identiﬁed a small
molecule, Ataluren, which has similar properties but seems to
be more potent and less toxic (20), and the use of antisense
oligonucleotides to promote exon skipping are also being
tested in muscular dystrophy (reviewed in ref. 21). The clinical
activities of these approaches are likely to be enhanced with
higher cellular concentrations of PTC-mutated mRNA. Indeed,
in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the expression of
PTC-mutated CFTR, as well as CFTR-mediated chloride transport, is improved in gentamicin-treated cells when UPF1 or
UPF2 are also depleted (22).

Pharmacologic Inhibition of NMD

Because translation is necessary for NMD (23), inhibitors of
translation are effective inhibitors of NMD (24). Unfortunately
these drugs are not candidates for clinical therapies because of
general toxicity and, as translation is inhibited, the ultimate
goal of restoring protein expression is not achieved. We have
recently demonstrated that NMD inhibition can be achieved
via other mechanisms. Speciﬁcally, we have shown that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a by a
variety of cellular stresses inhibits NMD (5, 25, 26). We have
also determined that modest (80%) depletion of UPF1 or UPF2
can suppress NMD activity without diminishing the proliferation or survival of cells (26). These observations suggest that
the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD can be achieved with
limited toxicity or adverse effects. We hypothesized that the
combination of a drug that can bypass a PTC and/or promote
exon skipping in combination with a drug that inhibits NMD
would be a synergistic combination and serve as an effective
platform to treat genetic diseases. To pursue this approach, we
performed a virtual screen to identify commercially available
compounds predicted to dock within a SMG7 pocket previously shown to be vital in the binding of UPF1. We then tested
whether these compounds interfere with NMD, and using PTCmutated p53 as a proof-of-principle model, whether the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD would make ribosomal readthrough strategies more effective in producing full-length
proteins.

Materials and Methods
Virtual library screening
The crystallographic structure of SMG7 (PDB ID, 1ya0) was
analyzed using the PocketFinder algorithm available in the
Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) software program (Molsoft, LLC). An appropriately sized pocket (based on criteria
previously reported in ref. 27) was selected as the target site for
virtual library screening (VLS) using ICM-VLS software (Molsoft, LLC). ICM-VLS uses global optimization with a biased
probability Monte Carlo conformational search to rapidly dock
fully ﬂexible, full-atom models of the ligands to a set of grid
potential maps calculated from the coordinates of the atoms in
the protein receptor. Each ligand-docking conformation is
then evaluated with a scoring function. The ICM-scoring
function integrates van der Waals energy, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, conformational entropy loss, and solvation electrostatic energy change (28). ICM-VLS was used to dock the
entire set of 436,115 compounds from the ChemBridge Express
Library using default ICM-docking parameters on three 3.0GHz Intel Xeon processors.
Cell lines and reagents
U2OS, Hela, 293, BJ-hTERT (BJ-human telomerase reverse
transcriptase), PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell),
MDA231, DU145, T98G, and HCT116 cells were grown as
previously described (29, 30). N417 cells were grown in RPMI
containing 10% FBS. Calu-6 (gift of E. Welch) and HDQP1 cell
lines (DSMZ German Collection of Microorganism and Cell
Cultures) were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
with 10% FBS. Pools of b-globin mRNA–expressing cells were
generated as previously described (25). Compounds were

obtained from Chembridge. UPF1 shRNA (short hairpin RNA;
ref. 26) and SMG7 shRNA (TRCN0000127998) were obtained
from Sigma. Primer sequences for b-globin, endogenous NMD
targets, p53, and p53 downstream targets are available upon
request.
Immunoblots and RNA assessment
Immunoblots were prepared as previously described (29)
and membranes were probed with antibodies against p53
(Abcam Inc.; ab26), SMG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.;
6-RE13), UPF1/Rent1 (SC H-300), SMG7 (A302-170A; Bethyl
Laboratories, Inc.). Immunoprecipitations were performed as
described previously (10). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed and incubated 30 minutes at 4 C with buffer containing 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCL at pH 7.4, 50 mmol/L NaCL, 0.05% Tween-20, 10
mmol/L tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/L NaF, 17.5
mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, and protease inhibitor (Roche). Lysates were clariﬁed
and incubated with 200 mg/mL RNaseA (Qiagen) at room
temperature for 15 minutes with gentle rotation before 4 C
overnight immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. Isolation of RNA for cDNA generation, real-time PCR (RTPCR), DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole)
treatment, RNA stability experiment, expression proﬁling, and
expression array data analysis were as described previously (25,
26). For unbiased gene expression experiments, cells were
treated with 50 mmol/L NMDI14 for 6 hours, 100 mg/mL
emetine for 3 hours, or depleted of UPF1 and RNA was
harvested, prepared, hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus
2.0 GeneChips and analyzed as previously described (26).
Cell viability assay and proliferation assay
To assess viability, cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and
incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), G418, NMDI (NMD
inhibitor) alone, or G418 with NMDI together for the indicated
hours. After incubations, cells and media were collected and
cells viability was measured as described (31). To assess cell
proliferation U2OS, Hela, and BJ-hTERT cells were cultured in
6-well plates and, after 24 hours, treated with NMDI14 for 0, 24,
48, and 72 hours. The cells were collected and viable cells were
counted by using the Countess Automated Cell Counter
(Invitrogen).
Protein synthesis (35S incorporation assay)
U2OS, Hela, and BJ-hTERT cells were incubated with DMSO,
NMDI14, or emetine as indicated. The cells were labeled with
100 mCi/mL [35S] Methionine for 30 minutes and the protein
were precipitated using the standard trichloroacetic acid
precipitation method as described previously (26). The precipitated protein was collected in glass ﬁber ﬁlters and
[35S]Methionine incorporation was measured by using liquid
scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Inc.).

Results
Identiﬁcation of potential NMD inhibitors
Prior studies have demonstrated that NMD activity is
dependent on the formation of a UPF1–SMG7 complex
(Fig. 1A), which has been crystallographically resolved (11).

Materials and Methods) were further ﬁltered by selecting those
with extensive hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts,
followed by hierarchical clustering for a diversity of scaffolds,
resulting in the identiﬁcation of 31 diverse compounds highly
structurally and chemically compatible with the target SMG7
pocket (Fig. 1C and D).

Though UPF1 and SMG7 may have additional non-NMD roles,
the interaction between the two seems to be unique for NMD.
Thus, the disruption of this complex is an ideal target for NMD
inhibition while minimizing the toxicity that might be seen
with other known mechanism of NMDIs, including translation
inhibitors and inducers of eIF2a phosphorylation (24, 25).
We elected to take a three-dimensional (3D) structure
activity approach to NMDI discovery by targeting this protein
interface. Only one pocket on the 3D structure of SMG7 was
both of suitable size and volume (between 150 and 550A3) and
was lined with functionally sensitive amino acid side chains
that mediate the interaction with UPF1 (Fig. 1B; ref. 11). This
pocket was selected as the target site for VLS of a collection of
436,115 compounds from the ChemBridge Express Library. The
resulting compounds achieving a docking score of <32 (see

PTC 39-mutated b-globin gene construct well established to be
degraded by NMD (32). In our initial screen, we treated cells

Pharmacologic Inhibition of NMD

gross toxicity in these cells. RNA was then harvested and
expression of PTC b-globin and wild-type b-globin mRNA was
determined using RT-PCR.
We identiﬁed 10 compounds that selectively increased the
expression level of PTC 39 b-globin greater than two-fold,
without affecting wild-type b-globin expression, with a P value
of <0.05 (Fig. 2A). Because of rapid degradation by NMD, the
steady-state mRNA expression of the PTC39 b-globin was
approximately 3% of the wild-type b-globin expression. Treating cells with NMDI14 for 6 hours, for example, led to an
increase of PTC 39 b-globin to 12%, a relative four-fold increase
that, if resulting in biologically active hemoglobin, would be
sufﬁcient to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of thalassemia
(Fig. 2B). When these 10 compounds were tested at decreasing
concentrations, we identiﬁed several NMDIs active at nano-

molar concentrations, with some active over a wide range of
concentrations and others exhibiting more narrow effective
concentration, which peaked at micromolar concentrations
and displayed even a biphasic effect (Fig. 2C and data not
shown). These compounds, previously not reported to affect
NMD, represent a diverse group of chemical scaffolds (Fig. 2D
and data not shown). We chose to focus the majority of our
further studies on one of these compounds, ethyl 2-{[(6,7–
dimethyl–3-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-quinoxalinyl)acetyl]amino}-4,5-dimethyl-3-thiophenecarboxylate (NMDI14),
which demonstrated dose-dependent activity, with signiﬁcant activity at low concentrations.
Although the activity of our identiﬁed NMDIs does not
depend on the mechanism of action, because these drugs were
screened in silico to ﬁt into the SMG7 pocket necessary to bind

UPF1, we expected that NMDI14 would interfere with the
interaction of UPF1 and SMG7. We immunoprecipitated
SMG7, in the presence of RNAse and conﬁrmed that both
overexpressed (Fig. 2E, left) and endogenous (Fig. 2E, right)
SMG7 interacted with overexpressed and endogenous UPF1,
respectively, and observed that this interaction was disrupted
when cells were treated with NMDI14.
NMDI can be achieved with minimal cellular toxicity in
multiple cell lines
NMD inhibition can result in the upregulation of nonmutated, mutated, and alternatively spliced mRNAs (5). Thus, NMD
inhibition might be predicted to result in widespread biologic
effects. In fact, we have recently reported that the genetic
inhibition of NMD subtly but signiﬁcantly increases autophagy,
presumably in an attempt to rid the cell of mutated and
misfolded proteins that accumulate with NMD suppression
(31). To determine the cellular toxicity of select NMDIs, we
assessed viability in treated Hela, U2OS, and Calu-6 cell lines,
and in immortalized/nontransformed human ﬁbroblasts.
These cells were treated with 50 mmol/L of NMDI14 and two
other effective NMDIs, as an assessment of any class toxicity
effects, for 48 hours, and viability was assessed. We noted almost
no toxicity with NMDI14 and NMDI25, and minimal toxicity
with NMDI9, suggesting the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD
is not unduly toxic in contrast with 24 hours of treatment with
emetine, which blocks NMD by inhibiting translation (Fig. 3A).
To determine whether the effective pharmacologic inhibition of NMD exerted a sublethal effect on proliferation, we
assessed proliferation in NMDI14-treated transformed and
nontransformed cell lines (Fig. 3B). Three days of treatment

resulted in no decrease in cell counts, demonstrating that the
pharmacologic inhibition of NMD can be achieved without
subtle changes in proliferation.
Because suppression of translation is a potent mechanism to
inhibit NMD, previously described inhibitors of NMD also
inhibit translation. Although we did not predict this mechanism of action for our compounds, we tested protein synthesis
after 6 to 24 hours of NMDI14 treatment. During the last hour of
treatment cells were pulsed with S35 methionine, and protein
was then precipitated and the incorporated S35 assessed.
NMDI14 had no effect on S35 incorporation (Fig. 3C). Together,
these data suggest that the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD
can be achieved without cellular toxicity.
NMDI14 increases the expression of endogenous NMD
targets
The effectiveness of NMDI14 in inhibiting NMD was
originally determined by assessing the expression of an
NMD-degraded reporter transcript that harbors a premature
stop codon (Fig. 2). Although NMD has been primarily
appreciated as a mechanism to rapidly degrade mutated
transcripts, we and others have demonstrated that a wide
variety of nonmutated transcripts are also degraded by
NMD, which have several distinct motifs, as well as unknown
features, which render them sensitive to NMD (25, 26, 33).
We noted that the steady-state mRNA expression, reﬂective
of both the rate of synthesis and the rate of decay, of seven
nonmutated NMD targets that we have validated (26)
increased in U2OS and/or Hela cells after treatment with
NMDI14, whereas no such increase was seen in non–NMDtargeted mRNAs (Fig. 4A).

Figure 3. NMDIs are not unduly toxic. A, U2OS, Hela, Calu-6, and BJ-hTERT cells were treated with three NMDIs at 50 mmol/L for 48 hours, and viability was
assessed. Toxicity with translation/NMDI emetine is shown as control. Average of three readings shown. B, U2OS, Hela, and BJ-hTERT cells were treated

of NMDI14 for 6 and 24 hours. The cells were pulsed with S methionine (100 mCi/mL) for last 1 hour and protein synthesis was measured by S incorporation.
The protein synthesis with translation/NMDI emetine is shown as control.

Pharmacologic Inhibition of NMD

Figure 4. NMDIs stabilize endogenous mRNA. A, U2OS Hela cells were treated with 50 mmol/L of NMDI14 for 6 hours, and endogenous nonmutated NMD
target expression was assessed by RT-PCR. Actin and eIF2B4 serve as negative controls.  , P < 0.05 by the Student t test vs. control. B, U2OS cells treated
with NMDI14 at 50 mmol/L for 6 hours. The whole gene expression was determined and compared with UPF1 knockdown and emetine-treated U2OS
cells. C, N417 cells, with a PTC-mutated p53, were treated with 5 mmol/L of NMDI14 for 24 hours and p53 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR.
Experiments were repeated three times and average  SE is displayed.  , P < 0.05 by the Student t test vs. DMSO. D, relative p53 mRNA expression
in U2OS cells and N417 cells treated with DMSO, and N417 cells treated with NMDI14 for 6 hours. Experiments were repeated three times and average  SE
displayed. E, p53 mRNA stability was determined, as described in text, in N417 and U2OS cells treated with DMSO or NMDI14 for 6 hours. Experiments
were repeated twice, with average  SE for each time point shown.

To assess potential off-target effects of NMDI14, we used
expression arrays to globally assess gene expression in U2OS
cells treated with NMDI14, emetine, or with UPF1 depletion
and compared this with gene expression in control U2OS cells.
Of note, 941 genes were increased >1.5-fold with NMDI14 (Fig.
4B). There was a signiﬁcant overlap (22%, P ¼ 1.2E25, c2 test) of
genes upregulated by NMDI with genes upregulated by emetine
treatment (which inhibits NMD potently but clearly has other
effects), and with UPF1 depletion (11%). In comparison, 20% of
the 5,290 genes upregulated by emetine were also upregulated
in UPF1-depleted cells. The overlap of genes regulated by
NMDI14 and those regulated by either emetine or UPF1 depletion is signiﬁcantly higher than what would be expected by
chance (3%). Genes upregulated by NMDI14 but not regulated by UPF1 or emetine, likely representative of off-target
effects, were not particularly enriched in any speciﬁc functional
group, and only demonstrated a greater than two-fold enrichment in ossiﬁcation, actin binding, and cytoskeletal binding,
suggesting that NMDI14 may not have speciﬁc toxicities.
We next determined whether our NMDIs are effective in
upregulating mutated endogenously expressed mRNAs. The
small-cell lung cancer cell line N417 has a p53 tumor-suppressor
gene that is deleted on one allele and on the other allele carries a
PTC mutation in the 298th codon that renders it a target for
NMD (34). When treated with an NMDI, we noted increased
expression of the mutated p53 mRNA (Fig. 4C). Similar effects
were seen in the breast cancer HDQP-I cell line, which carries a

www.aacrjournals.org

PTC mutation in the 213th codon of the p53 gene (35), and
the lung adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-6, which carries a
codon 196 PTC-mutated p53 (36). The treatment of N417
cells with NMDI14 for 6 hours led to a steady-state expression of p53 similar to that seen in U2OS cells (Fig. 4D). No
such effect was seen in cells expressing wild-type p53 in two
other cell lines (Fig. 4C). To directly assess p53 mRNA
stability, N417 and U2OS cells were treated with vehicle or
NMDI14 for 6 hours, and the RNA polymerase II inhibitor
DRB was added to stop mRNA synthesis. RNA was collected
at 0, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 hours after addition of DRB, and
expression of p53 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. NMDI14
signiﬁcantly increased the stability of PTC-mutated p53
mRNA in N417 cells, without altering the stability of wildtype p53 in NMDI-treated U2OS cells (Fig. 4E).
NMDI, along with a PTC "read-through" drug, increases
the protein expression of endogenous NMD targets
Although NMDI14 increases the stability and expression of
NMD-targeted mRNAs, a clinically effective strategy demands
the expression of a full-length, biologically active protein. As
noted previously, there are several drugs that can promote
read-through of PTCs. Although G418 has a modest effect of
suppressing NMD, the most effective agent at nontoxic concentrations, Ataluren, does not protect mRNAs from NMD (20).
We reasoned that if there were more mutated mRNA present,
PTC read-through drugs might be more effective.

Pharmacologic Inhibition of NMD

We noted minimal expression of full-length p53 in N417 cells
treated with G418, but signiﬁcantly more in cells treated with
both G418 and NMDI14 (Fig. 5A). This increase was seen over a
variety of dose concentrations of G418, demonstrating that in
the presence of NMDI14 higher full-length p53 expression can
be achieved at lower and potentially less toxic G418 concentrations (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the HDQP-I and Calu-6 cell lines,
which carry p53 PTC mutations, showed signiﬁcant increased
full-length p53 expression with the combination of G418 and
NMDI14 (Fig. 5A). The expression of wild-type p53 in HCT116
cells was unaltered by these treatments (Fig. 5A). The effectiveness of the two drugs varied among cell lines, which could
either reﬂect variability in ribosomal read-through (which
depends on the termination codon sequence; ref. 20), or
cell-type–dependent NMDI14 metabolism. Consistent with an
increase in full-length/active p53 restoration, the combination
of both drugs led to a synergistic increase in multiple p53 target
genes mRNAs, including p21, BAX, and PUMA in N417 and cells
(Fig. 5C). This led to an increase in the mRNA levels of the
proapoptotic BAX and PUMA similar to those seen in U2OS
cells (Fig. 5D). As expected by the lack of p53 mRNA induction
in nonmutated p53 cells with NMDI14 (Fig. 4C), in p53 wildtype cell lines HCT116 and U2OS NMDIs had no effect on p53
protein expression or p53 target gene expression over a wide
range of concentrations (Fig. 5A, C and data not shown).
Together, these data indicate that NMDIs can increase endogenous mutated mRNAs and, in combination with a PTC bypass
drug, can result in full-length protein production.

The restoration of full-length p53 with NMD inhibition
and a "read-through" drug leads to cell death in cells with
a PTC-mutated p53
The frequently mutated p53 gene is a tumor suppressor that
can induce apoptosis. The reestablishment of p53 in cancer
cells, with or without chemo/radiation, has been a therapeutic
strategy pursued in a wide variety of cancer for almost two
decades, but this approach has been hampered by problems in
delivery of wild-type p53 (37, 38). Although NMDIs are relatively nontoxic, we hypothesized that the combination of
NMDI with a "read-through" drug would restore full-length
p53 and result in a p53-mediated cell death. We treated N417
and HDQP-I cells with a combination of read-through drug and
a dose of NMDI14 that results in full-length p53 expression. We
noted a synergistic cell death only with the combination of
drugs that led to full-length p53 expression (Fig. 5E). No such
death was seen when G418 and NMDI14 was used on cells with
wild-type p53, including U2OS and primary PBMCs (Fig. 5E).

Although the combination of G418 and NMDI14 was not
toxic in p53 wild-type cells, we examined a number of additional cell lines as controls (Fig. 5F). These included HCT116
p53 wild-type and isogenic HCT116 p53 null cells, to determine
whether the combination of NMDI14 and G418 is toxic only to
cells without a functional p53. We also tested the breast cancer
cell line MDA-231, the prostate cancer cell line DU145, and the
glioblastoma cell line T98G, all of which carry single-nucleotide
p53 mutations that do not result in PTCs and are, thus, not
NMD targets. As with other cell lines we examined, 48 hours
treatment with NMDI14 alone was minimally toxic (<5% cell
death) in these cell lines. G418 alone showed variable toxicity.
However, similar to the p53 wild-type cells and in contrast with
those cell lines with NMD-provoking p53 mutations. In no case
did the addition of NMDI14 and G418 lead to a synergistic cell
death.

Discussion
We have used a virtual screening strategy to identify small
compounds that inhibit NMD. The inhibition of NMD augments the expression of PTC-mutated mRNAs and nonmutated mRNAs normally targeted by NMD. Several of these
identiﬁed NMDIs, representing diverse chemical backbones,
are active at the nanomolar level even without further chemical
modiﬁcation to optimize their solubilities or pharmacokinetic
properties. The few pharmacologic inhibitors previously
described have been useful in delineating the mechanism of
NMD, but either inhibit translation, interfere with mRNA
splicing, have not been demonstrated to upregulate enogenous
NMD targets, have weak activity, do not synergize with readthrough drugs, were identiﬁed through functional screening
assays, and/or have unknown mechanisms of action (24, 39–
41). The rational design of our screening makes it likely that our
identiﬁed compounds are more speciﬁc with less off-target
effects than these. Although several of our NMDIs do not seem
excessively toxic in a variety of cell lines and have no effect on
the expression of mRNAs that are not targeted by NMD, further
work is needed to document and potentially improve the
speciﬁcity, in vivo effectiveness, and off-target toxicity of these
lead compounds.
Because of the important role NMD plays in degrading many
mutated, alternatively spliced, and physiologically expressed
mRNAs, even speciﬁc inhibition of NMD without any off-target
effects might be theorized to be toxic. Indeed, the complete
depletion of UPF2 in mice results in nonviability (42). However,
we and others have demonstrated that the more modest
depletion of UPF1 and UPF2, through shRNA, does not adversely affect cell proliferation or survival (26). In addition,

inhibition of NMD by UPF2 deletion in murine hematopoietic
cells results only in diminished hematopoietic progenitor cells
with almost no effect on differentiated hematopoietic cells
(42), and widespread constitutive expression of a dominant
negative UPF1 only modestly affects the differentiating mouse
thymus and spleen (43). Although the inhibition of NMD by
these stresses normally occurs in growing tumors and in fact is
necessary for the 3D growth of cells in soft agar and as explants,
the depletion of UPF1 from cells with shRNA does not increase
their 3D growth, and, thus, we would not expect inhibition of
NMD to necessarily augment tumorigenesis (26). The future
clinical use of these or other NMDIs, however, will obviously
require further studies to determine the short- and long-term
effects of potent NMD inhibition.
Although NMD requires the pausing of a ribosome at a
PTC, the use of the PTC read-through drug Ataluren does
not inhibit NMD, potentially because only a small percentage of mutated mRNAs are read-through by Ataluren. Thus,
we have predicted that Ataluren, as well as other strategies,
would be more effective in the presence of more substrate
mRNA. We have validated this approach by demonstrating
that the combination of a read-through drug and NMDI
results in the increased protein expression of a PTC-mutated
p53, resulting in improved p53 function. Many genetic disorders have mutations that either directly (nonsense) or
indirectly (e.g., splicing mutations, additions or deletions
that alter reading frame, alternations in poly-A processing)
can render an mRNA sensitive to NMD. These include cancer
(e.g., p53 and BRCA1). Because truncated proteins may be
able to replicate the function of the full-length protein, may
be completely nonfunctional, or may act as dominant negatives against the full-normal allele, the effects of inhibiting
NMD will have to be carefully considered, particularly with-

out a simultaneous consideration of restoring a full-length
protein with ribosome read-though. However, based on our
data the concomitant pharmacologic inhibition of NMD
remains an attractive therapeutic strategy for many genetic
diseases, including cancer.
