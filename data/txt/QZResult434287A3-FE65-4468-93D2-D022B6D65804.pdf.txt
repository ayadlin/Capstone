Abstract
Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor that reduces the risk of colon cancer. However, the basis for its cancer
chemopreventive activity is not fully understood. In this study, we defined a mechanism of celecoxib action
based on degradation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a major regulator of the death receptor
pathway of apoptosis. c-FLIP protein levels are regulated by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation. We found that celecoxib controlled c-FLIP ubiquitination through Akt-independent inhibition
of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), itself a candidate therapeutic target of interest in colon cancer. Celecoxib
increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3, including the a and b forms, even in cell lines, where
phosphorylated Akt levels were not increased. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors abrogated Akt phosphorylation as expected but had no effect on celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation. In contrast, protein kinase
C (PKC) inhibitors abolished celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation, implying that celecoxib influenced GSK3
phosphorylation through a mechanism that relied upon PKC and not Akt. GSK3 blockade either by siRNA or
kinase inhibitors was sufficient to attenuate c-FLIP levels. Combining celecoxib with GSK3 inhibition enhanced
attenuation of c-FLIP and increased apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the effects of GSK3
inhibition and increased c-FLIP ubiquitination, confirming that c-FLIP attenuation was mediated by proteasomal turnover as expected. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism through which the regulatory effects of
c-FLIP on death receptor signaling are controlled by GSK3, which celecoxib acts at an upstream level to control
independently of Akt. Cancer Res; 71(19); 6270–81. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is the major
inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase-8 activation (1). c-FLIP has multiple splice
variants, and 2 main forms have been well characterized: short
form (c-FLIPS) and long form (c-FLIPL) c-FLIP (1). Generally
speaking, elevated c-FLIP expression protects cells from death
receptor–mediated apoptosis, whereas downregulation of
c-FLIP by chemicals or siRNA augments death receptor–
mediated apoptosis (1). Moreover, overexpression of c-FLIP

protects cells from apoptosis induced by certain cancer
therapeutic agents such as etoposide and cisplatin (2–4).
c-FLIP is known to be subjected to rapid turnover, regulated
by an ubiquitin–proteasome mechanism (5, 6). Certain cancer
therapeutic agents stimulate downregulation of c-FLIP expression through this mechanism (5). However, the mechanism underlying drug-induced c-FLIP degradation is unclear.
A recent study has shown that c-jun-NH2-kinase–mediated
activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch specifically ubiquitinates c-FLIPL and induces its proteasomal degradation (7).
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a ubiquitous
serine/threonine kinase that is present in mammals in 2
isoforms: a and b (8, 9). GSK3 was initially identified as an
enzyme involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism.
Increasing evidence during the past decades indicates that
GSK3 has a key role in regulating a diverse range of cellular
functions including cell survival and death (8, 9). Thus, GSK3
inhibition has been considered an attractive therapeutic
strategy for certain diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental disorders (10, 11). It has been
documented that GSK3 exerts opposing apoptosis-regulating
effects: It inhibits the death receptor–mediated extrinsic
apoptotic pathway while promoting cell death caused by
the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway (8). Inhibition
of GSK3 with either small-molecule inhibitors or siRNA
sensitizes cancer cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)-induced or agonistic death receptor 5 (DR5)

GSK3 Regulation of c-FLIP Degradation

antibody-induced apoptosis (12–14). However, it is largely
unclear how GSK3 inhibition enhances death receptor–induced apoptosis (8). Recently, a study showed that GSK3 is
involved in forming an antiapoptotic protein complex with
DDX3 and cIAP-1, leading to inhibition of apoptotic signaling
by preventing formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and caspase-8 activation (14). However, linkage between
GSK3 and c-FLIP regulation has not been suggested.
Celecoxib, a marketed anti-inflammatory and anti-pain
drug, is being tested in clinical trials for its chemopreventive
and therapeutic effects against a broad spectrum of epithelial
malignancies either as a single agent or in combination with
other agents. The antitumor activity of celecoxib is thought to
be associated with its ability to induce apoptosis in a variety of
cancer cells (15). The molecular mechanisms underlying
celecoxib-mediated apoptosis have not been fully elucidated,
although it seems to be associated with the inactivation of
PDK1/Akt, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress involving upregulation of CHOP/GADD153, and increase in Ca2þ
levels, or downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin
(16). Our previous results have shown that celecoxib induces
apoptosis in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines
involving the activation of the extrinsic death receptor pathway through both DR5 induction and c-FLIP downregulation
(17, 18).
We have shown that celecoxib downregulates c-FLIP
through facilitating ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent protein
degradation (18). However, the signaling process leading to
celecoxib-induced c-FLIP degradation is unknown. In an effort
to show the mechanism underlying celecoxib-induced c-FLIP
degradation, we have revealed a novel mechanism of c-FLIP
degradation through GSK3 inhibition. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study showing a linkage between
GSK3 inhibition and c-FLIP downregulation, thus highlighting
a new mechanism by which GSK3 modulates the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway.

manual. Gene-silencing effects were evaluated by Western blot
analysis.
Reverse transcription PCR for detection of c-FLIP
mRNA
Total cellular RNA was extracted from a given cell line
with TRI-Reagent (Sigma Chemicals) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions.
The cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the following
primers: FLIP sense 50 -ACAGAGTGAGGCGATTTGAC-30 ;
FLIP antisense 50 -GAACAGACTGCTTGTACTTCT-30 ; actin
sense 50 -GGCACCCAGCACAATGAAGATCAA-30 and actin
antisense 50 -ACTCGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGA-30 . The
25-mL amplification mixture contained 1 mL of the cDNA,
0.5 mL of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (25 mmol/L each), 1
mL each of the sense and antisense primers (20 mmol/L
each), 5 mL of TaqMaster PCR enhancer, 1 mL of Taq DNA
polymerase (5 units/mL; Eppendorf), 2.5 mL 10 reaction
buffer, and sterile H2O. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles.
After an initial step at 95 C for 3 minutes, each cycle
consisted of 1 minute of denaturation at 94 C, 1 minute
of annealing at 55 C, and 1 minute of extension at 72 C. This
was followed by an additional extension step at 72 C for 7
minutes. The housekeeping gene actin was also amplified as
an internal reference. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel, stained, and directly visualized under UV illumination.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significances among treatment groups were
analyzed with 1-way ANOVA with GraphPad InStat 3 software
(GraphPad Software). Results were considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Celecoxib increases Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation in
human NSCLC cells
It has been suggested that phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt signaling positively regulates c-FLIP expression
in tumor cells (24, 25). Given that celecoxib was shown in
some studies to inhibit PDK1/Akt signaling in certain types
of cancer cells such as prostate cancer cells (26–29), we
questioned whether there is a link between celecoxib-induced c-FLIP downregulation and Akt inhibition. To this
end, we first determined whether celecoxib affects Akt
phosphorylation in a panel of human NSCLC cell lines. In
our cell systems, we did not find that celecoxib inhibited Akt
phosphorylation in any tested NSCLC cell lines. Instead, we
detected increased levels of p-Akt in some cell lines exposed
to celecoxib (e.g., H157, Calu-1, and H358; Fig. 1A). In some
cell lines such as H1792, we did not detect either basal levels
or increased levels of p-Akt upon treatment with celecoxib
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we examined the effects of celecoxib
on the phosphorylation of 2 well-known Akt substrates,
GSK3b and FOXO3a. As presented in Fig. 1A, celecoxib

6272

Cancer Res; 71(19) October 1, 2011

weakly increased p-FOXO1a levels in only 1 of 5 cell lines
(i.e., Calu-1), whereas it increased p-GSK3b levels in all the
tested cell lines. Through detailed time course analysis, we
found that the observed increase in p-Akt levels occurred 3
hours after celecoxib treatment and was sustained to 16
hours in both Calu-1 and H358 cell lines. Accordingly,
p-FOXO1a levels were weakly increased after 3 hours in
Calu-1 cells and after 10 hours in H358 cells after exposure to
celecoxib. In Calu-1 cells, celecoxib increased the levels of pGSK3b or a/b in a fashion similar to the p-Akt increase;
however, in H358 cells, celecoxib increased p-GSK3 levels
even at 1 hour posttreatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, these data
clearly indicate that celecoxib exerts more pronounced
effects on increasing the phosphorylation of GSK3 (both a
and b) than on Akt in human NSCLC cells.
DMC is a celecoxib derivative lacking COX-2–inhibitory
activity (30). It possesses more potent effects than celecoxib
on induction of apoptosis, downregulation of c-FLIP, and
enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (19). DMC even
at 15 mmol/L increased the levels of p-GSK3b in H157, H460,
and Calu-1 cells, whereas it increased p-Akt levels only at 30
mmol/L in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Celecoxib increases GSK3 phosphorylation
independent of Akt and mTOR/p70S6K signaling
It is well known that Akt phosphorylates GSK3 resulting
in its inactivation (31). To show whether the celecoxibinduced increase in GSK3 phosphorylation is due to an
increase in Akt phosphorylation, we compared the effects
of celecoxib on GSK3 phosphorylation in the absence and
presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or wortmannin.
Both LY294002 and wortmannin abrogated celecoxib-induced Akt phosphorylation but failed to prevent the increase in GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Similarly,
LY294002 blocked DMC-induced Akt phosphorylation but
failed to affect DMC-induced increase in p-GSK3b (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results indicate that celecoxib and
DMC increase GSK3 phosphorylation independent of Akt.
It has been suggested that p70S6K also regulates or
phosphorylates GSK3 under certain conditions (32, 33).
Thus, we next asked whether this mechanism is involved
in mediating celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation. To
this end, we treated 2 NSCLC cell lines with celecoxib in the
absence and presence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin,
which is known to shut down mTOR/p70S6K signaling (34),
and detected p-GSK3 and p-S6 (a readout of p70S6K activity) levels. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, rapamycin
abolished basal levels of p-S6 despite the lack of increase in
p-S6 levels by celecoxib, indicating the successful inhibition
of p70S6K activity. However, rapamycin did not affect
celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation at all. These
results suggest that celecoxib also induces GSK3 phosphorylation independent of mTOR/p70S6K. We noted that rapamycin alone strongly increased p-Akt levels in both cell
lines, as we previously reported (35); however, it either did
not increase p-GSK3b levels (i.e., Calu-1) or induced a
weaker p-GSK3b elevation than celecoxib (i.e., H358; Supplementary Fig. S2).

Celecoxib induces protein kinase C–dependent GSK3
phosphorylation
Protein kinase C (PKC) has been documented to phosphorylate GSK3 (36–41). Thus, we next determined whether
PKC is involved in mediating GSK3 phosphorylation by
celecoxib. As presented in Fig. 2B, the presence of the
pan-PKC inhibitor R€
o31-8220 abolished the ability of celecoxib to increase GSK3 phosphorylation in both Calu-1 and
H358 cells. Moreover, we examined the effects of other PKC
inhibitors on celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation and
found that another pan-PKC inhibitor GF1092303X, the PKC
a and b inhibitor G€
o9679, and the PKC a–x inhibitor G€
o6983
could abolish celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation. In
contrast, the PKC d inhibitor rottlerin did not inhibit celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Collectively,
these results clearly suggest that celecoxib induces GSK3
phosphorylation through a PKC-mediated mechanism, likely
involving PKC a and b. We also examined p-Akt levels in
cells exposed to these treatments and found that the presence of these PKC inhibitors except for G€
o6976 actually
exerted enhanced effects on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B
and C). This result further supports that celecoxib-induced
GSK3 phosphorylation is separated from the increase in Akt
phosphorylation.

Inhibition of GSK3 enhances the ability of celecoxib to
downregulate c-FLIP
To determine the impact of GSK3 phosphorylation on
celecoxib-induced c-FLIP downregulation, we used GSK3
siRNAs to knock down GSK3a and GSK3b, respectively,
and then examined their effects on celecoxib-induced c-FLIP
reduction. In H358 cells, GSK3a siRNA reduced the levels of
GSK3a only whereas GSK3b siRNA (#1) reduced the levels of
not only GSK3b but also GSK3a (Fig. 3A). Silencing of GSK3
with both GSK3a and GSK3b siRNAs reduced basal levels of
FLIPL, suggesting that GSK3 regulates c-FLIP. Treatment of
these cells, particularly GSK3a siRNA- or GSK3b #1 siRNAtransfected cells, with celecoxib resulted in further reduction
of FLIPL levels, which were lower than in cells treated with
celecoxib alone or GSK3 siRNA transfection alone (Fig. 3A).
These results indicate that silencing of GSK3 enhances the
effect of celecoxib on downregulation of c-FLIP (i.e., FLIPL).
We further examined the effects of celecoxib combined with
a GSK3 inhibitor on c-FLIP downregulation. Both celecoxib
and SB216763 alone decreased the levels of c-FLIP; however,
the combination of celecoxib and SB216763 was even more
potent than either agent alone in decreasing c-FLIP levels
(Fig. 3B). Moreover, the combination of celecoxib with
SB216763 was also much more effective than either celecoxib

or SB216763 alone in increasing DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3C)
and in inducing PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D). For example, the
mean arbitrary units for DNA fragments induced by celecoxib,
SB216763, and their combination were 0.224, 0.115, and 1.320,
respectively, in comparison with 0.045 in control cells treated
with DMSO. Thus, it is clear that the combination of celecoxib
and SB216763 increases DNA fragmentation to a greater level
than the sum of that caused by celecoxib or SB216763 alone,
suggesting that celecoxib combined with a GSK3 inhibitor
results in more than additive (i.e., synergistic) apoptosisinducing effects in human NSCLC cells.
Modulation of GSK3 activity alters c-FLIP levels
The above data on reduction of c-FLIP by GSK3 inhibition
(Fig. 3) suggest that GSK3 positively regulates c-FLIP levels.

Thus, we carried out more detailed experiments to validate
this finding. To this end, we first treated 4 human NSCLC cell
lines with different pharmacologic GSK3 inhibitors including
LiCl, SB216763, and SB415286 and then detected c-FLIP levels
in cells exposed to these treatments. As shown in Fig. 4A, all 3
GSK3 inhibitors exerted dose-dependent effects on reducing
the levels of c-FLIP including FLIPL and FLIPS. Reduction of cFLIP by GSK3 inhibition with a GSK3 inhibitor such as
SB216763 occurred early, 3 hours after exposure to
SB216763 in both Calu-1 and H358 cells (Fig. 4B), indicating
that c-FLIP downregulation is an early event following GSK3
inhibition. Moreover, we further inhibited GSK3 by knocking
down its expression using GSK3 siRNAs against the a and b
forms, respectively, in both NSCLC cell lines. As presented in
Fig. 4C, silencing of GSK3a minimally decreased the levels of

enforced expression of WT, KD, and CA GSK3b in H1299 cells
and then examined their impact on c-FLIP levels. As presented
in Fig. 4D, expression of WT, particularly CA GSK3b, but not
KD GSK3b, increased the levels of c-FLIP. Thus, it seems that
activation of GSK3b elevates c-FLIP levels. Collectively, these
results clearly indicate that GSK3 positively regulates
c-FLIP.
Inhibition of GSK3 reduces c-FLIP levels by facilitating
its ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation
Given that c-FLIP protein is subjected to rapid turnover
through ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation (5, 6)
and that celecoxib downregulates c-FLIP levels through this
mechanism (18), we examined whether inhibition of GSK3
results in ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated c-FLIP degradation. Before these experiments, we determined whether inhibition of GSK3 affects c-FLIP at the mRNA level. Using RTPCR, we did not detect any changes in c-FLIP mRNA levels in
cells exposed to SB216763 (Fig. 5A), indicating that GSK3
inhibition-induced c-FLIP reduction does not occur at the
transcriptional level. In the absence of the proteasome inhib-

itor MG132, SB216763 reduced c-FLIP levels; however, this
effect was abolished by the presence of MG132 in both H157
and H358 cells (Fig. 5B). By immunoprecipitation/Western
blotting, we detected the highest levels of ubiquitinated FLIPL
in cells treated with SB216763 plus MG132 compared with
cells exposed to SB216763 alone or MG132 alone (Fig. 5C),
indicating that SB216763 increases c-FLIP ubiquitination.
Collectively, we conclude that inhibition of GSK3 facilitates
ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated c-FLIP degradation, leading
to c-FLIP downregulation.
Inhibition of GSK3 induces c-FLIP degradation
independent of the E3 ligase Itch
The E3 ligase Itch has been suggested to be involved in
TNFa-induced FLIPL degradation (7). We then asked whether Itch is involved in mediating ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of c-FLIP induced by GSK3 inhibition.
Transfection of 2 different Itch siRNAs into H157 cells
substantially reduced the levels of Itch, indicating successful
knockdown of Itch (Fig. 5D). However, knockdown of Itch
neither increased basal levels of c-FLIP nor prevented c-FLIP
reduction induced by SB216763 (Fig. 5D). Similar results
were also generated in cells exposed to celecoxib (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results clearly indicate that
Itch is unlikely to be the E3 ligase that mediates GSK3
inhibition-induced ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent c-FLIP
degradation.

Inhibition of GSK3 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis
Given that c-FLIP is the major inhibitor of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway, it is plausible to speculate that downregulation of c-FLIP by inhibition of GSK3 will sensitize cancer
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis as celecoxib does (17).
Indeed, the combination of TRAIL with a GSK3 inhibitor such
as SB415286 or SB216763 exerted much more potent effects
than TRAIL or the inhibitors alone in decreasing the survival
of human NSCLC cells (Fig. 6A and B). In agreement, the

6276

combinations were also more potent than each single agent
alone in inducing cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3,
and PARP (Fig. 6C), that is, activation of caspase cascades.
Collectively, these results indicate that inhibition of GSK3 (e.g.,
with a small-molecule inhibitor) augments TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
Moreover, we tested whether downregulation of c-FLIP by
GSK3 inhibition indeed contributes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further compared the effects of TRAIL combined

Figure 5. Inhibition of GSK3 does not alter c-FLIP mRNA levels (A), rather facilitates ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated c-FLIP degradation (B and C) independent
of Itch (D). A, the indicated cell lines were treated with the given concentrations of SB216763 for 6 hours and then subjected to preparation of total cellular
RNA and subsequent detection of c-FLIP using RT-PCR. B, the given cell lines were pretreated with 20 mmol/L MG132 for 30 minutes prior to the addition
of 20 mmol/L SB216763. After cotreatment for 4 hours, the cells were harvested for preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western
blot (WB) analysis. C, H157-FLIPL-21 cells, which stably express ectopic flag-FLIPL, were transfected with HA-ubiquitin plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection
reagent for 24 hours. The cells were then pretreated with 20 mmol/L MG132 for 30 minutes and then cotreated with 20 mmol/L SB216763 for 4 hours.
Whole-cell protein lysates were then prepared for immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody
for detection of ubiquitinated FLIPL (Ub-FLIPL) and anti-Flag antibody for detection of ectopic FLIPL. D, H157 cells were transfected with the indicated
siRNAs for 48 hours and then treated with 20 mmol/L SB216763 for additional 8 hours. The cells were harvested for preparation of whole-cell protein
lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis for detection of the indicated proteins.

with a GSK3 inhibitor, SB216763, on cell survival and caspase
activation in H157 cell lines, which express Lac Z (as a
control), FLIPS, and FLIPL. As presented in Fig. 7A, the
combination effectively decreased the survival of H157-Lac
Z-5 cells (e.g., by >50% compared with SB216763 or TRAIL
alone) but not that of H157-FLIPS-1 cells. The combination
reduced the survival of H157-FLIPL-21 cells only by less than
10% compared with SB216763 or TRAIL alone, although the
reduction was statistically significant. Consistently, the
SB216763 and TRAIL combination was more effective than
either agent alone in inducing cleavage of caspase-8, caspase9, caspase-3, and PARP in H157-Lac Z-5 cells, but this
effect was substantially attenuated in both H157-FLIPL-21
and H157-FLIPS-1 cells (Fig. 7B). Thus, enforced expression
of ectopic FLIPS or FLIPL abolished or attenuated the ability of
GSK3 inhibition to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.

Discussion
The mechanisms by which celecoxib and its analogues
induce apoptosis have long been a subject of intensive
research. One such mechanism seems to be the inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

of PDK1/Akt signaling as documented in some studies (26–
29). However, other studies have failed to show such a
mechanism (30, 42, 43), thus leaving this as a controversial
issue (16). In our studies primarily involving human NSCLC
cell lines, we have never observed inhibition of p-Akt levels by
celecoxib or its analogues such as DMC when they are used at
growth arrest and apoptosis-inducing concentration ranges
(up to 50 mmol/L). Instead, we detect increased p-Akt levels in
some cell lines when they were exposed to celecoxib, as
presented in Fig. 1. Thus, our data do not support a role
for Akt inhibition in mediating celecoxib-induced growth
arrest and apoptosis, at least in NSCLC cells.
Interestingly, the phosphorylation of GSK3 including both a
(at Ser 21) and b (at Ser 9) isoforms, which are well known to
be phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt (31, 44), was increased
by celecoxib in dose- and time-dependent manners in the
tested NSCLC cells, even in those without an increase in Akt
phosphorylation (e.g., H1792; Fig. 1). Given that phosphorylation of GSK3 at Ser 21/Ser 9 results in inactivation of GSK3
(9, 11), our findings thus imply that celecoxib actually inhibits
GSK3 function. Although celecoxib increases the phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3 in some of our tested cell lines
(e.g., H358 and Calu-1), inhibition of celecoxib-induced Akt

phosphorylation with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or wortmannin did not accordingly abrogate celecoxib-induced GSK3
phosphorylation (Fig. 2), suggesting that celecoxib induces
Akt-independent GSK3 phosphorylation or inhibition. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of celecoxib
inhibition of GSK3.
In addition to Akt, other kinases, such as p70S6K and
PKC, can also phosphorylate GSK3 (9, 32, 33, 36–41). In our
study, we did not show a role for mTOR/p70S6K in celecoxib-induced GSK phosphorylation because rapamycin
effectively inhibited the basal levels of p-S6 but did not
prevent the increase in Akt phosphorylation by celecoxib
(Fig. 2). However, both R€
o31-8220 and GF109203X, which are
pan-PKC inhibitors, abolished celecoxib-induced GSK3
phosphorylation, suggesting that celecoxib induces PKCdependent GSK3 phosphorylation or inhibition. It is well
known that PKC comprises multiple isoforms (45). Among
these isoforms, PKC a, b, and d isoforms have been suggested to regulate GSK3 phosphorylation (36, 41). In our
study, we found that both G€
o6983, a specific PKC inhibitor
lacking activity against the m isoform, and G€
o6979, a specific
PKC a/b inhibitor, but not rottlerin, a specific PKC d
inhibitor, were as effective as the pan-PKC inhibitors in
abolishing celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2).
Thus, we suggest that the PKC a/b isoforms may be
important for mediating celecoxib-induced GSK3 phosphor-

6278

ylation. These findings warrant further study in this direction. Our finding on celecoxib activation of PKC is novel,
although we have yet to define the mechanism by which
celecoxib activates PKC, warranting further investigation of
this subject.
It has been shown that GSK3b inhibition with either smallmolecule inhibitors or siRNAs potentiates TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (12). However, the
underlying mechanisms are unknown. In our study, we could
reproduce this biologic phenomenon in human NSCLC cells
(Fig. 6). Very importantly, we found that inhibition of GSK3
with either siRNAs or small-molecule inhibitors downregulated c-FLIP levels, clearly indicating that GSK3 inhibition
results in downregulation of c-FLIP levels. Complementarily,
enforced expression of CA GSK3 increased c-FLIP levels
(Fig. 4D). Thus, our findings clearly show that GSK3 regulates
c-FLIP levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study showing GSK3-dependent regulation of c-FLIP. Given
that enforced ectopic c-FLIP expression protects cells from
induction of apoptosis induced by GSK inhibition plus TRAIL
(Fig. 7), it is plausible to conclude that c-FLIP downregulation
should be a major event accounting for GSK3 inhibitionmediated enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus,
our findings on GSK3 regulation of c-FLIP provide a reasonable mechanism by which GSK inhibition potentiates TRAILinduced apoptosis.

It is known that c-FLIP proteins, including FLIPL and FLIPS,
are subjected to rapid turnover regulated through ubiquitin/
proteasome-mediated protein degradation (5–7). However,
the signaling event that triggers c-FLIP degradation has not
been characterized. Our previous studies have shown that
celecoxib and its analogue DMC downregulate c-FLIP levels
through facilitating ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation of c-FLIP (18, 19). In the current study, we found
that the inhibition of GSK3 with SB216763 did not increase
c-FLIP mRNA levels and that the presence of the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 prevented SB216763-induced c-FLIP downregulation. Moreover, SB216763 substantially increased c-FLIP
ubiquitination (Fig. 5). Collectively, these results indicate that
GSK3 inhibition–induced c-FLIP downregulation occurs at a
posttranslational level via promoting ubiquitin/proteasomemediated protein degradation. Given that celecoxib inhibits
GSK3, as discussed earlier, and reduces c-FLIP levels through
the same mechanism as we have previously shown (18), we
suggest that celecoxib inhibits GSK3, leading to facilitation of
c-FLIP degradation. The E3 ligase Itch has been suggested to
be involved in TNFa-induced c-FLIP (i.e., FLIPL) degradation
(7). In our study, we found that silencing of Itch expression
with Itch siRNAs neither increased basal levels of c-FLIP nor
blocked c-FLIP downregulation induced by either SB216763 or
celecoxib (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting
that Itch is unlikely to be involved in GSK3 inhibition–induced
c-FLIP degradation.
Previous work has shown that c-FLIP downregulation
contributes to celecoxib-induced apoptosis and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (18). In agreement, we found in
this study that siRNA-mediated silencing of GSK3b enhanced

the ability of celecoxib to downregulate c-FLIP (i.e., FLIPL).
Similar results were generated when cells were cotreated with
celecoxib and a GSK3 inhibitor (e.g., SB216763; Fig. 3). Thus,
our results further support an important role of c-FLIP downregulation, which is mediated by GSK3 inhibition, in celecoxib-induced apoptosis.
We have previously shown that celecoxib downregulates
c-FLIP independent of its COX-2 inhibitory activity by using
COX-2 siRNA and DMC, which lacks COX-2 inhibitory activity
(18, 19). In this study, we further showed that DMC also
increased p-GSK3 levels; this effect could not be abrogated
by LY294002 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, celecoxib-induced
GSK3 phosphorylation, and subsequent downregulation of
c-FLIP, is unlikely to be secondary to COX-2 inhibition.
In summary, this study shows a novel mechanism by which
celecoxib induces c-FLIP degradation through Akt-independent phosphorylation or inhibition of GSK3. Through this
study, we are able to show, for the first time, that inhibition
of GSK3 is associated with the induction of c-FLIP degradation, thus providing a reasonable explanation for how GSK3
inhibits the extrinsic death receptor–mediated apoptotic
pathway.
