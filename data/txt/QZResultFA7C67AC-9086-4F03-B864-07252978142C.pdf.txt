ABSTRACT
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGRF) are over-expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, we show significant
increase in COX-2, 5-LOX, and EGFR expression during PDAC progression. Targeting
complementary pathways will achieve better treatment efficacy than a single agent
high-dose strategy that could increase risk of side effects and tumor resistance. To
target COX-2, 5-LOX, and EGFR simultaneously, we tested effects of licofelone (dual
5-LOX-COX inhibitor), and gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), individually and in combination,
on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) and their progression to PDAC
using genetically engineered mice. Individually, licofelone (L) and gefitinib (G)
significantly inhibited incidence of PDAC in male (72% L, 90% G, p < 0.0001) and
female (90% L, 85% G, p < 0.0001) mice. The combination drug treatment produced
complete inhibition of PDAC in both genders. Pancreata of mice receiving combination
treatment showed significantly fewer Dclk1-positive cancer stem-like cells, inhibition
of COX-2, 5-LOX, PCNA, EGFR and β-catenin expression (p < 0.05–0.0002), increased
p21 expression. Significant changes in tumor immune responses and desmoplastic
reaction was observed by NGS analysis in combination treatment (p < 0.05). In
summary, early simultaneous targeting of 5-LOX-COX- and EGFR pathways may
provide additive inhibitory effects leading to complete suppression of PDAC.

The initiation of pancreatic cancer lesions and
their progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) and further metastatic invasion are associated
with inflammation. Several lines of evidence show
that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase
(5-LOX) are significantly over-expressed in cancers
[2–5]. COX-2 and 5-LOX metabolites play a pivotal role
in cell signaling and proliferation [2–5]. Their release
has been demonstrated in response to epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and growth stimuli. Preclinical studies
show that COX-2 inhibitors may inhibit pancreatic
cancer in vitro and in vivo; however, those studies have

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at late stages,
with almost uniform lethality. The five-year survival rate
for this deadly cancer is <7% [1]. Although gemcitabine
is the drug of choice, survival following treatment is
marginally improved, by only a few weeks. Hence, new
chemopreventive and therapeutic treatment strategies
are urgently needed. Research toward understanding this
disease led to the identification of major risk factors and
important molecular changes underlying pancreatic cancer
initiation and progression.

not been translated for clinical use [2–4]. Moreover, use
of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, in the prevention of
adenomatous polyps was associated with a significant
increase in risk of cardiovascular (CV) events [6, 7]. In
another study, the relative risk of CV events was 1.30
with the use of celecoxib, compared with placebo [8]. It is
widely accepted that selectively blocking COX-2 will shift
arachidonic acid metabolism towards the 5-LOX pathway,
overproducing leukotrienes and leading to increased
prothrombotic effects [2, 9]. Thus, preclinical and clinical
data underscore the importance of arachidonic acid
metabolism-related inflammatory responses in pancreatic
tumorigenesis.
Both COX-2 and EGFR are known to synergistically
activate oncogenic signaling. COX-2 and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) were found to be significantly
expressed in pancreatic tumors. The expression of COX-2
and EGFR in the majority of undifferentiated pancreatic
carcinomas suggests that COX-2 and EGFR might represent
targets for adjuvant therapy in anaplastic pancreatic cancer
[10]. The activation of the EGFR pathway promotes
transcription of the COX-2 gene. Also, EGFR transcription
and phosphorylation are activated by the COX-2 pathway.
Since both these pathways are involved in inflammation and
EGFR signaling that will lead to tumor cell growth, use of
agents that combined inhibit both pathways simultaneously
may provide synergy for improved tumor inhibition.
Although EGFR inhibitors are in use, their benefits are
limited and the use of higher doses leads to undesirable side
effects and toxicities. Clinically, targeting inflammation by
selective COX-2 inhibitors leads to increased cardiovascular
and GI toxicities. Therefore, targeting both EGFR and
5-LOX-COX- simultaneously may be an effective approach
to modulate three pathways and their downstream signaling,
which may result in an increased treatment response. In
the present study, we evaluated the potential anti-tumor
effects of licofelone, a novel dual 5-LOX-COX- inhibitor
(Fig. 1A), and gefitinib, a known EGFR inhibitor (Fig. 1B),
either individually or in combination, by simultaneously
modulating multiple targets (COX, 5-LOX, EGFR) using
a genetically engineered Kras mouse model (GEM) of
pancreatic cancer. This model has histopathology and
molecular features similar to human pancreatic cancers [11].
The use of this mouse model has played a key role in the
elucidation of the mechanisms and underlying pancreatic
tumorigenesis, and in the identification of anti-tumor agents
for the prevention of pancreatic cancer [12–18].

differences in the bodyweights of control and
licofelone-treated animals (Fig. 1D, 1E). However,
a non-significant  decrease was observed in the
bodyweights  of  animals treated with gefitinib and the
combination (Fig. 1D, 1E). Examination of the gross
anatomy of GEM and wild-type mice revealed no visible
evidence of any abnormality of the kidneys, liver, spleen,
intestines, heart, or lungs. There were no significant
differences in the weights of these organs in control and
experimental-diet-fed mice, indicating that the agents
did not produce any overt toxicity. However, pancreata
from control-diet-fed GEM developed visible tumors
and weighed significantly more than those from the
control-diet-fed wild-type mice, which were completely
free from tumor growth. Histopathological analysis of
formalin-fixed tumors confirmed the presence of PanIN
lesions and ductal adenocarcinoma in the pancreata of
GEM. Thus, we observed organ-specific tumor growth due
to specific p48Cre/+ activation of KrasG12D/+ in pancreata of
GEM, which could be monitored for the potential effects
of the test agents administered in diet.

Inhibition of pancreatic tumor weight and
PDAC incidence
Pancreatic weight is a simple marker to assess tumor
progression [17, 18]. A significant increase in pancreas
weight was observed in p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice
compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). As summarized
in Figs. 2A and 2B, the combination treatment caused a
significant decrease in the weight of pancreatic tumors
in p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice. The pancreatic tumor
weights in untreated control male and female GEM
were (Mean ± SEM) 1.33 ± 0.13 and 1.005 ± 0.16 g,
respectively. In GEM fed licofelone (L), gefitinib (G),
or L+G, the pancreas weights were Mean ± SEM 0.40
± 0.03, 0.43 ± 0.27, and 0.27 ± 0.03 g, respectively, in
males, and 0.31 ± 0.08 g, 0.38 ± 0.02 g, and 0.27 ± 0.18 g,
respectively, in females. The pancreata of wild-type mice
treated with L+G weighed 0.26 ± 0.02 g in male mice
and 0.26 ± 0.01 g in female mice. The pancreatic tumor
weights were reduced by 80% (p < 0.0001) with L+G
treatment in male mice and by 72% (p < 0.001) in female
mice (Fig. 2A, 2B). Extensive histopathologic analysis
of the pancreas using H&E-stained slides revealed no
microscopic pathologic alterations in wild-type mice
fed either AIN-76A or L+G-supplemented diets. In
contrast, AIN76A-diet-fed male and female p48Cre/+LSLKrasG12D/+ mice demonstrated 82% and 64% incidence
of PDAC, respectively (Fig. 2C and 2D). L, G, and L+G
treatments decreased PDAC incidence to 23%, 10%,
and 0%, respectively, in male GEM, and to 6%, 10%,
and 0%, respectively, in female GEM (Fig. 2C and 2D).
The combination treatment of L+G completely inhibited
carcinoma incidence in both male and female GEM.

The number of PanIN 2 and PanIN 3 lesions

combination-treated groups (Fig. 3C, 3D). A slight
increase in the number of PanIN 1 lesions was observed in
pancreata of mice treated with the combination, suggesting
a potential blockade of further progression of these lesions
to carcinoma in situ and PDAC. Carcinoma within the
pancreas was completely inhibited in male and female
GEM (Fig. 4A, 4B) receiving the combination treatment.
Up to 70% of the pancreata from mice treated with the
combination of licofelone and gefitinib appeared normal,
i.e., free from PanIN lesions and carcinoma, whereas up
to 4–5% of pancreata appeared normal in untreated GEM
(Fig. 4C, 4D).

Qualitative microscopic examination showed
a substantial increase in TUNEL-positive cells in the
pancreatic tumor tissue of mice treated with the combination.
Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells from pancreata
of control diet–fed mice showed 18 ± 1.8 (mean ± SEM)
compared with 62 ± 1.4 TUNEL-positive cells in pancreatic
tumor tissue from combination-treated mice, accounting
for a fivefold increase in the apoptotic index ( p < 0.0001,
Fig. 5D). Further, we also observed a significant decrease
in expression of PCNA, COX-2, 5-LOX, and DclK1 in the
combination treatment groups (Fig. 6A–6D, Supplementary
Fig. 1). In agreement with the apoptosis results, we
observed a significant increase in p21 expression (Fig. 6E,
Supplementary Fig. 1) and a decrease in β-catenin in the
treatment groups (Fig. 6F, Supplementary Fig. 1). IHC/IHF
analysis revealed decreased COX-2, 5-LOX, and pEGFR
expression in licofelone+gefitinib treated groups compared
with untreated groups (Fig. 7).

anti-inflammatory agents can block signals from tumor
cells, and potentially affect cancer stem cells (CSCs)

expression in treatment groups (Fig. 8). Combination
treatment significantly reduced DclK1 expression (Fig. 8,
Supplementary Fig. 1).

Gene expression profiling in pancreatic tumor
tissues
We observed a significant increase in the
inflammatory genes COX-2 and 5-LOX, along with
EGFR, in the pancreatic tumors from 44-weekold mice compared with pancreata from wild-type
mice, as determined by Next Generation Sequencing/
RNAseq analysis (Fig. 9A). However, in the individual
and combination drug treatments, these levels were
significantly reduced (Fig. 6, 7, Supplementary Fig. 1). To
investigate transcriptomic changes in actively progressing
pancreatic cancer, we performed Next Generation
Sequencing/RNAseq using the pancreatic tissues from
mice fed control diet or combination drug treatment for
25 weeks. At the endpoint, PanIN lesions and carcinomas
were recorded. The sample numbers met the requirements

was greatly reduced (>24 fold) followed by MMP23
(>21 fold). Notable changes were observed in the
genes related to immune responses and desmoplastic
reaction (Table 2) along with changes in inflammatory
genes (Fig. 9C, Table 2). Importantly, the macrophage
stimulating receptor (Mst1r) was reduced by > 40 fold
(Table 2). Other genes that were upregulated were
galanin recptor 1 (Galr1) (8.96 fold; p < 0.05), tumor

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer treatment is challenging, due to
the aggressive nature of the disease and a lack of effective
drug treatments. The commonly used FDA-approved
drug, gemcitabine, a deoxycytosine analog, represents the
current standard-of-care for advanced PC; gemcitabine
improves quality of life in a minority of patients [19] and
increases survival by few weeks. Studies showed that
median survival is extended by 14 days with the use of
EGFR inhibitor erlotinib [20]. Understanding pancreatic
cancer development and finding ways to treat this disease
at all stages are clear and imperative needs [21].

It is well-established that 95% of the pancreatic
cancers are associated with K-ras mutations. Several of the
molecular signaling changes occur as the disease progress
from initial pancreatic precursor lesions PanINs (PanIN 1
to PanIN 2 to PanIN 3) to ductal adenocarcinoma. Of
these, the most commonly observed changes are marked
dysregulation of EGFR signaling and inflammatory
pathways. EGFR dysregulation is observed in over
87% of patients with pancreatic cancer [22–24]. Both
inflammation and EGFR play a pivotal role in disease
progression. During progression of PC, COX-2, and
5-LOX are over-expressed, along with EGFR (Fig. 9).
Studies showed that the activation of the EGFR pathway
promotes transcription of the COX-2 gene [25, 26].
Likewise, the COX-2 signaling pathway activates EGFR
phosphorylation [27] and EGFR transcription [28]. The
EGFR and COX-2 pathways interact at several levels,
and are involved in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis, and
chemoresistance. The EGFR pathway plays a central role
in the regulation of COX-2 expression. Activation of the
Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB
transcription factor upregulates COX-2 gene transcription
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway stabilizes
COX-2 mRNA [25, 26]. Similarly, overexpression of
the COX-2 enzyme can potentially affect the EGFR
signaling pathway. Prostaglandins (PG) transactivate the
EGFR by induction of phosphorylation of the EGFR and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase [27]. Further, COX-2
overexpression induces EGFR expression [28]. In addition
to COX-2 inhibition, celecoxib is known to directly inhibit
the EGFR pathway through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and
NF-κB pathways [29–31]. Although EGFR inhibitors are
in use, their benefits are limited and the use of higher doses
leads to undesirable side effects and toxicities. Clinically,
targeting inflammation by selective COX-2 inhibitors leads
to increased cardiovascular and GI toxicities. Therefore,
targeting both EGFR and 5-LOX-COX- simultaneously
may be an effective approach to modulate three pathways
and their downstream signaling, which may result in
an increased treatment response. Hence, the aim of this
study was to determine whether simultaneous targeting of
inflammatory pathways (5-LOX-COX) and EGFR at early
stages would lead to blockade of progression of PanIN
lesions to carcinoma.

determined by western immunoblotting. The combination of L+G significantly decreased PCNA, COX-2, 5-LOX, DclK1, and
β-catenin expression, with an increase in p21 expression, compared with individual drug treatment.

We first used transcriptome analysis to establish
that COX-2, 5-LOX, and EGFR concurrently overexpress
in PDAC from GEM compared with pancreata from
wild-type mice (Fig. 9A). We chose licofelone as antiinflammatory agent due to its ability to simultaneously
inhibit COX and 5-LOX, which limits undesirable
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, and chose
gefitinib as the EGFR inhibitor to study their individual
and combined effects on PDAC development. Lower
doses of these two agents were selected, based on our
previous studies [5, 12]. In our long-term in vivo efficacy
study, we demonstrated that licofelone and gefitinib can

DclK1, and can potently inhibit PanIN progression to
PDAC without any side effects.
Male and female mice receiving treatment with
licofelone or gefitinib alone showed dramatic inhibition of
PDAC incidence. A complete blockade of PDAC (100%
inhibition) was observed with the combination treatment.
Up to 70% of development of carcinoma in situ (PanIN 3
lesions) was blocked by the combination, compared with
a 56% and 50% blockade by the individual drugs. These
results clearly demonstrate that combination treatment
effectively blocks progression of PanIN lesions to ductal

mice receiving the combination treatment were free from
PanIN lesions.
We have previously shown in vivo chemopreventive
effects of licofelone on colon and bladder cancers [32,
33]. There are limited reports on the evaluation of COX-2
inhibitors, and no reports on dual COX/5-LOX inhibitors
used in combination with EGFR inhibitors against PC
using a GEM model. For example, the use of selective
COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide and NO-aspirin delayed
the progression of PC precursor lesions in the KrasG12D
mouse model [2, 3]. In in vitro studies, the combination
of celecoxib, SC-236, and NS-398 with gefitinib,
trastuzumab, and cetuximab showed growth inhibition and
potentiated the apoptotic effect in squamous cell cancer
and breast and colon cancer cell lines [34–36].
The effects of the combination treatment on
pancreatic tumor weights were strongly correlated
with effects on PDAC incidence, carcinoma in situ
development, and incidence of ductal adenocarcinoma.
The pancreas weights from GEM receiving the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination treatment were comparable to those of
wild-type mice. Previous investigations of our group
and others  revealed the anti-proliferative and apoptotic
effects of licofelone and gefitinib on colon, bladder,
and pancreatic cancers [5, 12, 32, 33]. Our results here
clearly indicate that the licofelone+gefitinib combination
effectively suppressed the growth and progression of PC
in GEM. We propose that the synergism obtained due to
simultaneous inhibition of 5-LOX-COX- and EGFR at
early stages might be an underlying mechanism for the
enhanced antitumor effects. In vitro studies of pancreatic
cancer reported that a combination of erlotinib and
celecoxib downregulated EGFR and COX-2 expression
and activation [37]. However, further studies are warranted
to establish cause and effect.
In the present study, licofelone+gefitinib suppressed
DclK1 CSC marker and inhibited tumor progression,
compared with individual drug treatments, suggesting
that the combination may effectively act on eliminating
CSCs. Though PGE2 is implicated in CSC survival and
proliferation, recent evidence shows that 5-LOX is also

a candidate for the management of stem cells [38]. We
also observed that genetic ablation of COX-2 did not
significantly reduce DclK1 in Kras GEM mice [5]. This
may be partly attributed to the shift of arachidonic acid
metabolism pathways towards 5-LOX upon selective
inhibition of COX-2 [5]. Hence, the use of a dual
5-LOX-COX-inhibitor like licofelone is ideal to kill CSCs
effectively. Drugs like metformin and licofelone have been
shown to specifically target cancer stem cells, thereby
showing greater effects in blocking pancreatic and breast
tumor growth and prolonging remission [5, 17, 39, 40].
The concurrent inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and
EGFR leads to greater anti-tumor activity in pancreatic
cancer [37]. In addition to COX-2 inhibition, celecoxib
is known to directly inhibit the EGFR pathway through
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways [37].
In vitro studies showed no potentiation in growth

inhibition or apoptosis in the cell lines with low EGFR
expression. However, significant downregulation of
COX-2 and EGFR expression was observed in cells with
high EGFR expression treated with the combination of
erlotinib and celecoxib, compared with individual drugs
[37]. Since high EGFR expression is seen in about 87%
of patients with PC, and also reflected in the present
study, the combination of licofelone and gefitinib reduced
COX-2, 5-LOX, EGFR, DclK1, mPGES-1, mPGES-2,
FLAP, and β-catenin, and increased p21 expression,
compared with untreated controls and animals treated
with either drug alone. Importantly, number of genes

pattern in the tissues did not return to normal after
treatment. The reason for this could be due to presence of
PanIN lesions even after combination treatment (Fig. 9D).
Mechanistically, the effects of the gefitinib and
licofelone combination can be attributed to the inhibition
of expression of COX-2, 5-LOX, EGFR, and DclK1, as
shown by the schematic diagram in Fig. 10. In addition,
the combination significantly downregulated mPGES-1,
mPGES-2, and FLAP, which in turn contribute to the release
of prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes, and thromboxane; and
changes in the tumor immune responses and desmoplastic
reaction. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the exact
and in-depth mechanism of this combination treatment.
In conclusion, licofelone can potentiate the pancreatic
tumor growth inhibitory effects of gefitinib in GEM with
pancreatic cancer. Our study reports for the first time the use
of combination of a dual 5-LOX-COX- inhibitor, licofelone,
with gefitinib in a genetically engineered Kras mouse model
that recapitulates human disease progression in a step-wise
manner. However, further studies using different GEMs
must be conducted to translate this combination approach
to the clinic. Therefore, targeting the EGFR and 5-LOXCOX- pathways seems to be a promising approach for the
prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

animal care and use committee. Animals were housed in
ventilated cages under standardized conditions (21°C, 60%
humidity, 12-h light/12-dark cycle, 20 air changes/hour)
in the University rodent barrier facility. Semi-purified
modified AIN-76A diet ingredients were purchased from
Bioserv, Inc., NJ. Generation of p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+
mice expressing the activated KrasG12D oncogene has
been described previously [17, 18]. The dual COX/5LOX inhibitor licofelone and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib
were procured from the NCI-DCP chemoprevention drug
repository. Mice were allowed ad libitum access to the
respective diets (licofelone 250 ppm, gefitinib 100 ppm,
or a combination) and to automated tap water purified by
reverse osmosis.

Breeding and genotyping analysis
LSL-KrasG12D/+ and p48Cre/+ mice were maintained
in a C57BL/6 heterozygous genetic background. LSLKrasG12D/+ and p48cre/+ mice were bred and offspring of
activated p48Cre/+.LSL-KrasG12D/+ and C5BL/6 wild-type
mice were generated at the required quantities. Briefly,
genomic DNA was isolated from tail tissue samples
using the mini-prep kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for
K-ras and Cre genes using the following conditions:
denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles
at 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min.

age, p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice were fed AIN-76A
experimental diets containing 0 ppm drug (n = 34/group
+ n = 12 C57BL/6 wild-type mice), 250 ppm (n = 28/
group) licofelone, 100 ppm (n = 23/group) gefitinib, or a
combination of licofelone+gefitinib (250 ppm + 100  ppm,
n = 24/group) until termination of the study. After
38 weeks (~10 months) on experimental diets, all mice
were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and necropsied.
Pancreata were collected from all groups, weighed,
and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis.
Pancreata (head to tail) required for histopathologic and
IHC evaluations to identify PanIN lesions and PDAC for
evaluation of various molecular markers were fixed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin, as previously described.

fields per section) were counted manually in a single-blind
fashion.

After euthanizing the mice, pancreata and other
key organs, including liver, spleen, kidney, and lung,
were collected and weighed. Tissues were fixed in 10%
formalin for 24 h and routinely processed and embedded
in paraffin. Formalin-fixed 4-μm tissue sections of each
pancreas were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)
and were histologically evaluated by a pathologist blinded
to the experimental groups. PanIN lesions and carcinoma
were classified according to histopathologic criteria
as recommended elsewhere [4, 12–18]. To quantify
the progression of PanIN lesions, the total number of
ductal lesions and their grades were determined [12–18].
Similarly, pancreatic carcinoma and normal appearing
pancreatic tissue were evaluated in all animals.

Western blot analysis
Proteins (60 ug) in lysates from pancreata from
control and drug-treated mice were separated by SDSPAGE and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Biorad)
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and were then incubated
with antibodies for PCNA, COX-2, 5-LOX, Dclk1, p21,
β-catenin, and actin overnight at 4°C. Subsequently,
membranes were washed and incubated with HRPsecondary antibody for 1 h. Protein was detected on
BioMax MR film (Kodak) using chemiluminescence
(Super Signal, Pierce Biotechnology). Equal protein
loading was confirmed by detection of actin. ImageJ was
used to perform image analysis.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
immunofluorescence (IHF)

Next generation sequencing (NGS)/RNA-seq and
data analyses

Fixed 5-μm sections were incubated with primary
antibodies in a hybridization chamber for 1 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies
were proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), COX-2,
5-LOX, and pEGFR procured from Santa Cruz/Abcam/
Cell Signaling. Following incubation with primary
antibody, sections were incubated for 1 h with antimouse/anti-rabbit/anti-goat secondary antibody, then
were visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and were
counterstained with hematoxylin for IHC or with DAPI for
IHF. Slides were observed under an Olympus microscope
1X701. Digital computer images were recorded with an
Olympus DP70 camera.

Pancreatic tumor tissues were collected from at least
three untreated control mice and three combination-drugtreated mice, after 25 weeks of drug treatment. Total RNA
was extracted with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies,
San Francisco, CA) and subjected to cDNA library
construction, followed by NGS, per the NGS protocol,
with an Illumina sequencer in the OUHSC core facility
(Microgen). The sequence data was deposited to the
Geospiza/Perkin Elmer (Seattle, WA) company server
and analyzed with GeneSifter bioinformatics software.
The same data set was also analyzed with Strand
bioinformatics software (Strand-NGS, San Francisco,
CA).

Apoptosis assay

Statistical analysis

Paraffin sections (n = 6 mice/group) of 5-μm
thickness that had been mounted on slides were rehydrated
and stained using the Fragment End Labeling (FragEL)
DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit with the TUNEL
method, following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). This kit allows the recognition
of apoptotic nuclei in paraffin-embedded tissue sections
fixed on slides by FragEL of DNA. The terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase binds to exposed ends
of DNA fragments generated in response to apoptotic
signals, and catalyzes the template-dependent addition
of biotin-labeled and biotin-unlabeled deoxynucleotides.
Biotinylated nucleotides are detected using streptavidinHRP conjugate. Diaminobenzidine reacts with the
labeled sample to generate an insoluble colored product
at the site of DNA fragmentation. Counter-staining with
methyl green aids in the morphologic evaluation and
characterization of normal and apoptotic cells. Stained

The data are presented as means ± SE. Differences
in body weights were analyzed by ANOVA. Statistical
differences between control and treated groups were
evaluated using Fisher’s exact test for PDAC incidence.
Unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction was used for
PanIN and PDAC lesions. Differences between groups are
considered significant at p < 0.05.
