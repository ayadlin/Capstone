Abstract
Deregulated ribosomal RNA synthesis is associated with uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation. RNA
polymerase (Pol) I, the multiprotein complex that synthesizes rRNA, is activated widely in cancer. Thus,
selective inhibitors of Pol I may offer a general therapeutic strategy to block cancer cell proliferation. Coupling
medicinal chemistry efforts to tandem cell- and molecular-based screening led to the design of CX-5461, a potent
small-molecule inhibitor of rRNA synthesis in cancer cells. CX-5461 selectively inhibits Pol I–driven transcription
relative to Pol II–driven transcription, DNA replication, and protein translation. Molecular studies demonstrate
that CX-5461 inhibits the initiation stage of rRNA synthesis and induces both senescence and autophagy, but not
apoptosis, through a p53-independent process in solid tumor cell lines. CX-5461 is orally bioavailable and
demonstrates in vivo antitumor activity against human solid tumors in murine xenograft models. Our findings
position CX-5461 for investigational clinical trials as a potent, selective, and orally administered agent for cancer
treatment. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1418–30. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The rate of ribosome biogenesis controls cellular growth
and proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1). It, therefore, is tightly
regulated in mammalian cells and is tuned to respond to
extracellular stimuli such as nutrient availability and stress.
During tumorigenesis, the tightly regulated relationship
between extracellular signaling and ribosome biosynthesis
is disrupted, and cancer cells begin the excessive production of ribosomes necessary for the protein synthesis associated with unbridled cancer growth. rRNA is a major
component of the ribosome and, as such, carcinogenesis
requires an increase in its synthesis (reviewed in refs. 2–5).
Indeed, an increase in the synthesis of rRNA, which is
transcribed in the nucleolus by RNA polymerase (Pol) I,
correlates with an adverse prognosis in cancer (6). Moreover, enlarged nucleoli, reflective of accelerated rRNA

synthesis, have long been recognized as a marker for
aggressive tumor cells (7, 8). A number of approved cancer
therapeutics reportedly act through inhibition of rRNA
synthesis, but none directly target the Pol I multiprotein
enzyme complex (4, 9).
The potential therapeutic benefit of selectively inhibiting
the Pol I target so fundamental to cancer cell survival
prompted the need for identification of small molecule
drugs that selectively inhibit rRNA synthesis. For this
purpose, we fashioned a cell-based quantitative reversetranscription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that differentiates
between the effects of compounds on Pol I- and Pol II–
driven transcription. In this article, we describe the discovery and characterization of CX-5461, a potent and selective
inhibitor of Pol I–mediated rRNA synthesis in cancer cells
that does not inhibit DNA, mRNA or protein synthesis. We
reveal that CX-5461 induces autophagic cell death in cancer
cells but not normal cells and exhibits potent in vivo antitumor activity in murine xenograft models of human solid
tumors with a favorable safety profile. CX-5461 represents a
fundamentally new class of small molecule–targeted anticancer therapeutics.

qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR assays were performed as previously described
(11) with HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells and then confirmed with A375 and MIA PaCa-2 cells.
Cell-free Pol I transcription assay
A reaction mixture consisting of 30 ng/mL DNA template
corresponding to (160/þ379) region on rDNA and 3 mg/
mL nuclear extract isolated from HeLa S3 cells in a buffer
containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mmol/L KCl,
0.8% polyvinyl alcohol, 10 mg/mL a-amanitin was combined with different amounts of test compounds and incubated at ambient for 20 minutes. Transcription was
initiated by addition of rNTP mix (New England Biolabs)
to a final concentration of 1 mmol/L and was incubated for
1 hour at 30 C. Afterward, DNase I was added and the
reaction was further incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. DNase
digestion was terminated by the addition of EDTA to final
concentration of 10 mmol/L, followed immediately by 10minute incubation at 75 C, and then samples were transferred to 4 C. The levels of resultant transcript were analyzed by qRT-PCR on 7900HT Real Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were treated with 2 mmol/L of CX-5461 for 1 hour and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed
as previously described (11, 12).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay

the competition studies, a mixture of 5 nmol/L of DNA
probe and 0.6 mg SL1 complex was incubated in binding
buffer for 15 minutes at ambient temperature with 0.4 to
12.5 mmol/L CX-5461 or CX-5447. The resulting complexes
were resolved using Novex TBE DNA retardation PAGE
(Invitrogen). The gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film
(Kodak).

with dose response of drugs for 96 hours. Cell viability
was determined using Alamar Blue and CyQUANT assays
(Invitrogen).
Detection and quantification of acidic vesicular
organelles with acridine orange staining
Cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and treated the next

Animal experiments were performed with 5- to 6-weekold female athymic (NCr nu/nu fisol) mice of Balb/c origin
(Taconic Farms) in accordance with approved standard
operating protocols of Cylene Pharmaceuticals that were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were inoculated with 5  106 in 100 mL of cell

Results
Discovery of CX-5461
To screen for inhibitors of rRNA synthesis, we developed a
cell-based screening assay capable of identifying agents that
selectively inhibit Pol I transcription relative to Pol II transcription. Two short-lived RNA transcripts (half-lives 20–30
minutes), one produced by Pol I and another by Pol II, were
quantitated by qRT-PCR as a measure of drug-related effects
on transcription. The 45S pre-rRNA served as the Pol I
transcript and the mRNA for the protooncogene c-myc served
as the comparator Pol II transcript. Both Pol I and Pol II
transcription are known to be affected by general cellular
stress. To minimize the potential effects of such stress, cells
were exposed to test agents for only a short period of time (2
hours). This is sufficient time for these transcripts to be
reduced by greater than 90% if a drug affects their synthesis.
Among numerous molecules screened, CX-5461 (Fig. 1A)
was found to selectively inhibit rRNA synthesis (Pol I IC50 ¼ 142
nmol/L; Pol II IC50 > 25 mmol/L; selectivity  200-fold) in the
HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1B). Selective inhibition of rRNA synthesis
by CX-5461 was confirmed in two other human solid tumor cell
lines; melanoma A375 (Pol I IC50 ¼ 113 nmol/L; Pol II IC50 > 25
mmol/L) and pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 (Pol I IC50 ¼ 54
nmol/L; Pol II IC50  25 mmol/L; Fig. 1C).
Characterization of CX-5461
To determine if CX-5461 directly targets the Pol I machinery
and to identify which specific step in Pol I transcription it may
affect, we performed cell-free transcription "order of addition"
studies (Fig. 1D). CX-5461 was preincubated with either
nuclear extract (NE) or with DNA template (Template) prior
to the preinitiation complex (PIC) formation, after the PIC
formation but prior to initiation of transcription (NE/Template), or after the initiation of the transcription (NE/Template/NTP). Analysis of the resulting rRNA transcripts by qRTPCR (Fig. 1D) revealed that addition of 80 nmol/L CX-5461
prior to PIC formation resulted in considerable inhibition of
Pol I transcription, whereas addition after PIC formation only
minimally affected Pol I transcription. These data indicate CX5461 directly targets the Pol I machinery and inhibits Pol I
transcription at the initiation stage.
CX-5461 inhibits Pol I via disruption of the SL1-rDNA
complex
ChIP analysis was employed to investigate the effects of CX5461 on the association of various components of the Pol I
multiprotein complex with the rDNA promoter. Treatment of
HCT-116, A375, or MIA PaCa-2 with 2 mmol/L CX-5461
resulted in 40% to 60% reduction of the Pol I enzyme association with the rDNA promoter (Fig. 2A). Further, CX-5461
significantly depleted the binding of Pol I transcription factors
(TF) to the rDNA promoter in HCT-116 cells, with the TBP and
TAFI110 subunits of SL1 being most overtly affected (Fig. 2B).
As SL1 is required for stabilization of UBF on and recruitment
of Pol I to the rDNA promoter, the effect of CX-5461 on the
binding of UBF and Pol I to rDNA is most likely secondary to
the compound's effect on SL1 (15).

Cancer Res; 71(4) February 15, 2011

Because TBP is a member of both Pol I and Pol II transcription machineries (as a unit of the TFIID transcription
factor), we compared the effects of CX-5461 on binding of TBP
with the Pol I promoter on rDNA relative to its binding to the
promoter of 2 genes transcribed by Pol II (p21 and histone
H2B). Treatment with CX-5461 had no effect on the binding of
TBP to the Pol II promoter regions in HCT-116 cells, but did
inhibit binding of TBP to the Pol I promoters (Fig. 2C). To test
if CX-5461 could directly compete with SL1 for the rDNA
promoter, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) measuring the interaction of purified human
SL1 with a radiolabeled, double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the promoter region of rDNA. As a negative
control, we used a close analogue of CX-5461, CX-5447, that is
inactive against Pol I transcription (IC50 > 25 mmol/L).
Although CX-5447 had no detectable effect on the stability
of the SL1/rDNA complex, CX-5461 clearly disrupted the SL1/
rDNA complex (Fig. 2D). Such dissociation was likely due to
disruption of the protein–rDNA interaction rather than dissociation of SL1 itself, as we detected no decrease in protein–
protein interactions within SL1 after treatment with CX-5461
(data not shown).
Biological characterization of CX-5461
To ensure that CX-5461 selectively inhibits rRNA transcription but not DNA or protein synthesis, HCT-116, A375, and
MIA PaCa-2 cells were preincubated with 10 mmol/L CX-5461
for 60 minutes and pulsed for an additional 120 minutes with
modified precursors BrdU or 35S-methionine. Mitoxantrone
and cycloheximide served as positive controls for inhibition
of DNA and protein synthesis, respectively. At this concentration, which is approximately 100-times higher than its IC50
for the inhibition of Pol I transcription, CX-5461 had only
modest effects on global DNA or protein synthesis (Fig. 3A).
In dose–response studies, the IC50 for inhibition of DNA
synthesis in A375 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines ranged from
16.8 to 27.9 mmol/L, whereas a high-test dose of 30 mmol/L
CX-5461 had no significant effect on proteins synthesis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, CX-5461 possesses 250- to 300-fold
selectivity for inhibition of rRNA transcription versus DNA
replication and protein translation.
Using Gene Expression Arrays (Illumina or qRT-PCR based)
as a tool to probe for any potential effect of CX-5461 on Pol II
transcription, we observed that 1-hour exposure of MIA PaCa2 (Fig. 3B) or A375 (Fig. 3C) cells to 300 nmol/L CX-5461 (that
resulted in 63% and 55% reductions in pre-rRNA, respectively),
an equal number of Pol II–transcribed genes were significantly
upregulated as were downregulated. These changes in Pol II
transcription were most likely secondary to the inhibition of
Pol I by CX-5461, as an inhibition of Pol II transcription results
in a distribution significantly skewed to the negative (16). To
further illustrate selectivity of CX-5461 for Pol I versus Pol II
transcription, we compared it with another drug (actinomycin
D) known to inhibit Pol I transcription. Treatment of MIA
PaCa-2 cells with either 1 mmol/L CX-5461 or 1 mmol/L
actinomycin D causes rapid inhibition of Pol I transcription,
with an observed half-life of 21 minutes for 45S pre-rRNA in
both cases (Fig. 3D). However, actinomycin D inhibited Pol II

approximately 5,000 nmol/L was observed for the BJ-hTert
normal cell line (nontransformed hTERT-immortalized

as the IC50 for rRNA synthesis for the BJ-hTert normal cell line
of 74 nmol/L correlated well with the IC50 values of the solid

Selective Inhibitor of RNA Pol I Complex Exhibits Antitumor Activity

equivalently inhibit Pol I transcription in cancer and normal
cells, but the normal cells can tolerate reductions in rRNA
synthesis without induction of cell death whereas the cancer
cells cannot.
Inhibition of Pol I transcription has been previously
demonstrated to cause nucleolar stress that leads to stabilization of p53 and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis
(17). We therefore wanted to determine if CX-5461 promotes
stabilization of p53. For this purpose, we performed a dose–
response analysis of CX-5461 and measured levels of p53 at
24 and 48 hours in wild-type (wt) p53 A375 cells. As shown in
Figure 4C, whereas CX-5461 slightly increased p53 levels, it
did so at concentrations 3- to 10-fold higher than its IC50 for
Pol I transcription. Actinomycin D, used as a positive control, caused a more robust increase in p53 levels. In addition,
we analyzed the correlation between the sensitivity of cell
lines to CX-5461 and their p53 genetic status. Among the 44
cell lines with known p53 status, 18 had wt p53 and 26
carried some form of mutation in the p53 gene (18). The
analysis revealed that across all tested cell lines CX-5461
exhibits similar sensitivity in wt p53 cell lines (median IC50 ¼
144 nmol/L) as it does in cell lines with mutant p53 (median
IC50 ¼ 138 nmol/L), P ¼ 0.56 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the 3
cell lines most sensitive to CX-5461 were derived from
hematologic malignancies that had wt p53. When we then
further analyzed data for correlations of p53 status with
sensitivity to CX-5461 among hematologic cancers, we did
observe a significant difference (P ¼ 0.003) between the
activity of CX-5461 in cell lines with wt p53 (3 cell lines,
median IC50 ¼ 5 nmol/L) and those with mutant p53 (8 cell
lines, median IC50 ¼ 94 nmol/L). Although the sample size is
too limited to make strong conclusions, it does hint at an
intriguing possibility that nucleolar stress signaling in hematologic cancers is more dependent on p53 function and is
worthy of future investigation.
CX-5461 induces autophagy and senescence in solid
tumor cancer cells
Next, we investigated the mode of cell death promoted by
CX-5461 in the A375 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Previously, inhibition of rRNA synthesis using "semi-selective" drugs, such as
actinomycin D, was shown to induce apoptosis (19). Not
surprisingly, we found that actinomycin D induced apoptosis,
as judged by Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage and
caspases-3/7/9 cleavage (Fig. 5A), as well as caspase activation
analysis and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). However,
no changes in these apoptotic markers were observed for CX5461, with the exception of very modest cleavage of PARP after
48-hour treatment with 1 mmol/L of CX-5461 in MIA PaCa-2
(Fig. 5A). These data indicated that apoptosis is not the
primary pathway through which CX-5461 affected cellular
viability. In addition, no evidence of necrotic cell death was
detected, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release
as late as 48 hours after the initiation of treatment (data not
shown). These data led us to consider the possibility that CX5461 might be inducing autophagy to kill these solid tumor
cell lines.

www.aacrjournals.org

Using immunofluorescence cytometry to monitor the production of LC3B-II, a known marker of autophagy (20), we
observed that a 24-hour treatment with 300 nmol/L CX-5461
caused a significant increase from 15%  3% to 67%  2% in
LC3B-II staining (P ¼ 0.0041) in A375 and from 19%  2% to
62%  3% in LC3B-II staining (P ¼ 0.002) in MIA PaCa-2 cells
(Fig. 5B). In addition, CX-5461 promoted a concentrationdependent increase in acidic vesicular organelles (AVO)
including autophagolysosomes, another marker of autophagic
response (refs. 14, 21; Fig. 5C, see Supplementary Materials
and Methods). To exclude the possibility that induction of
autophagy by CX-5461 resulted from a decrease in the protein
translation rate, we performed a time-course analyses to
monitor the effects of CX-5461 on protein synthesis in A375
and MIA PaCa-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Although 24hour treatment of A375 or MIA PaCa-2 cells with CX-5461
dramatically reduced Pol I transcription (Fig. 3D; data not
shown), it had only a minor effect on overall protein synthesis
(13%–19% reduction at 300 nmol/L and 24%–27% reduction at
1 mmol/L). Several reports that have investigated the effects of
overall protein synthesis inhibition on the viability of cancer
cells demonstrated that such a reduction (i.e., <30%) should
not have a significant effect on cell viability (22). As autophagic
cells can themselves have reduced protein synthesis rate (23),
the observed effect of CX-5461 on protein synthesis is likely
secondary to the induction of autophagy and not vice versa.
Several recent reports link autophagy to the induction of
cellular senescence (24). The analysis of senescence-associated marker b-galactosidase demonstrated that, in addition
to autophagy, CX-5461 is able to induce senescence in both
cell lines. Treatment with 300 nmol/L CX-5461 for 24 hours
caused an increase in b-galactosidase staining from 6%  1%
to 79%  1% (P < 0.0001) in A375 cells and from 14%  2% to
55%  3% (P < 0.0001) in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 6). Together,
the mechanistic data demonstrate that treatment of solid
tumor cell lines with CX-5461 induces cellular senescence and
autophagy through selective inhibition of rRNA synthesis.
In vivo antitumor activity of CX-5461
The antitumor activity of CX-5461 was evaluated in two
murine xenograft models of human cancers, pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa-2) and melanoma (A375). In these xenograft models, CX-5461 was administered orally (50 mg/kg)
either once daily or every 3 days. Untreated animals received
vehicle orally on the equivalent schedule, whereas the positive
control gemcitabine was administered intraperitoneally once
every 3 days at 120 mg/kg. CX-5461 demonstrated significant
MIA PaCa-2 TGI with TGI equal to 69% on day 31 (Fig. 7A),
comparable to that of gemcitabine (63% TGI). Likewise, CX5461 demonstrated significant A375 TGI (Fig. 7B) with TGI
equal to 79% on day 32. Unpaired t test revealed statistically
significant differences between the vehicle-treated and CX5461–treated groups throughout both studies. CX-5461 was
well tolerated at all tested schedules as judged by the absence
of significant changes in animal body weights. These data
demonstrate that a selective inhibitor of Pol I transcription
can produce in vivo antitumor responses against solid tumors,
with a favorable therapeutic window.

Discussion
Deregulated rRNA synthesis plays a fundamental role in
tumorigenesis (reviewed in refs. 1–5), and Pol I is the key
regulatory enzyme required for production of rRNA (reviewed
in refs. 25–27). Herein, we present the results from a discovery
program that identified CX-5461, a small molecule that selectively inhibits Pol I–driven transcription of rRNA but does not
inhibit Pol II–driven mRNA synthesis or DNA or protein
synthesis. CX-5461 must be viewed globally as targeting a
specific transcriptional event. A host of currently marketed
drugs target transcription, including tamoxifen, cyclosporins,
salicylates, and others (28). In the case of CX-5461, it disrupts
the binding of the SL1 transcription factor to rDNA promoter,
which inhibits initiation of rRNA synthesis by the Pol I multiprotein complex. The inhibition of rRNA synthesis leads to
induction of senescence and autophagy in a p53-independent
manner in solid tumor cell lines. This response is not driven by
reductions in ribosomes or protein synthesis, as the cancer
cell induces the death pathway signaling long before any
reduction in ribosomes or protein content can occur (29).
SL1, a protein complex containing TATA-binding protein–
associated factors, is responsible for Pol I promoter specificity
(27, 30, 31). SL1 performs important tasks in transcription
complex assembly, mediating specific interactions between
the rDNA promoter region and the Pol I enzyme complex,
thereby recruiting Pol I, together with a collection of Pol I–
associated factors, to rDNA. Our data indicate that disruption

www.aacrjournals.org

of the SL1/rDNA complex by CX-5461 results from the interference between SL1 and rDNA and not through dissociation
of protein–protein interactions, as was shown for several
known tumor suppressors (p53, Rb, PTEN; refs. 32–34).
Numerous reports have linked the inhibition of rRNA
synthesis to induction of apoptosis. Actinomycin D, a relatively selective inhibitor of rRNA synthesis, inhibits Pol I
transcription during the elongation step (35) and induces
apoptosis in cancer cell lines (36). Inhibition of Pol I transcription at the elongation step leads to the formation of
truncated pre-rRNA, which can be interpreted by the cell as
breaks in rDNA. The cell attempts to repair such breaks and
ultimately triggers the apoptotic response (37). In contrast,
CX-5461 inhibits Pol I transcription prior to/during the PIC
formation step and induces autophagy in solid tumor cell
lines. When Pol I transcription is inhibited at the initiation
step, cells may interpret this as decreased nutrient availability.
The process of autophagy is known to be used by cancer cells
to survive times of limited nutrient availability, but when
driven to the extreme it causes cell death (38). Cancer cells are
continuously subjected to autophagy inducing stress (e.g.,
unfolded protein response; reviewed in ref. 39), and this
may prime them to become more susceptible to certain types
of metabolic stress such as inhibition of rRNA synthesis. This
may be one of the reasons why rapamycin that targets mTOR,
a protein kinase that serves as a sensor for nutrient availability
and in turn controls both rRNA as well as protein synthesis
(40), can also induce autophagy (reviewed in ref. 41). Likewise,

Selective Inhibitor of RNA Pol I Complex Exhibits Antitumor Activity

this might illustrate how CX-5461 takes advantage of the
unique qualities of cancer cells and elicits potent and selective
antitumor activity, whereas having minimal effect on nontransformed cells.
CX-5461 exhibited a broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity of cancer cells in vitro, whereas having a lesser effect on the
viability of nontransformed cells, indicating that certain cancer cells are significantly more susceptible to inhibition of
rRNA synthesis than nontransformed cells. Further, we analyzed if sensitivity of CX-5461 correlates with the p53 mutational status of cells, as inhibition of Pol I was previously
reported to cause nucleolar stress that leads to stabilization of
p53 and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis (17). Across all
cell lines, CX-5461 exhibited similar sensitivity in wt p53 and
mutant p53 cell lines. However, wt p53 cell lines derived from
hematologic malignancies appeared highly sensitive to CX5461 and this apparent trend is the focus of additional
investigations.
Herein, we present the results of a discovery and development program that identified CX-5461, a small molecule that
selectively inhibits Pol I transcription of rRNA. CX-5461 does
not inhibit Pol II transcription of mRNA or inhibit the synthesis of DNA or proteins. CX-5461 targets the SL1 transcription
factor of the Pol I complex and induces autophagy and
senescence among solid tumor cell lines and selectively kills
cancer cells relative to normal cells. Studies with human solid
tumors grown in murine xenograft models revealed that CX5461 can be orally administered with favorable pharmacokinetics and an antitumor efficacy without changes in body
weight or overt toxicity. In addition, our data demonstrate
that the anticancer activity of CX-5461 against solid tumors

does not depend on the p53 pathway that is frequently
mutated in many types of cancer. Thus, CX-5461 represents
a first-in-class oral small molecule therapeutic agent that
selectively targets Pol I transcription and induces autophagy
in solid tumors.
