Abstract
Malignant melanoma, once metastasized, has a dismal prognosis because of intrinsic resistance to anticancer
drugs. First-line therapy includes the methylating agents dacarbazine and temozolomide. Although DNA
mismatch repair and O6-methylguanine (O6MeG)-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) are key determinants of
cellular resistance to these drugs, there is no correlation between these markers and the therapeutic response in
melanoma, indicating as yet unknown mechanisms of drug resistance. We show that in malignant melanoma
cells with wild-type p53, the temozolomide-induced DNA damage O6MeG triggers upregulation of the
Fas/CD95/Apo-1 receptor without activating the apoptosis cascade. This is due to silencing of procaspase-8.
A single treatment with IFN-b reactivated procaspase-8 and sensitized melanoma cells to temozolomide. The
key role of procaspase-8 in melanoma cell sensitization was verified by experiments in which the death receptor
pathway was blocked by expression of dominant-negative FADD, siRNA knockdown of procaspase-8, or
stimulation with Fas/CD95/Apo-1 activating antibody. The expression of procaspase-8 could further be
enhanced by additional pretreatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), which
together with IFN-b caused significant sensitization of melanoma cells in vitro. Sensitization of melanoma
cells to temozolomide by IFN-b and VPA was also shown in a xenograft mouse model. The data provide a
plausible explanation why therapy of malignant melanomas with alkylating anticancer drugs failed even in
trials where the repair of the critical toxic lesion O6MeG was blocked by MGMT inhibitors and suggest
approaches to abrogate intrinsic drug resistance by IFN and VPA-mediated reactivation of the death receptor
pathway. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4150–60. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
First-line chemotherapy of malignant melanoma includes
the alkylating drugs dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide
(TMZ), and/or fotemustine (FM; ref. 1). DTIC is the most
commonly used drug. TMZ has the same efficacy and molecular mode of action as the active metabolite of DTIC. It can
be taken orally, does not need metabolic activation to form the
active metabolite 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), is able to cross the blood–brain barrier, and can
therefore also be used for the treatment of melanoma brain
metastases (2). Still, the response rate of the patients suffering
from melanoma treated with DTIC or TMZ remains poor, with
median survival durations between 5.3 and 6.7 months (3, 4).
Treatment combining TMZ with IFN-a can increase median
survival to 11.8 months (5). There is, however, no clear

rationale for concomitant treatment with IFN and TMZ
except the finding that IFNs may cause immunosensitization
of the tumor (6).
Agents like TMZ methylate DNA at 13 positions (7).
Prominent methylation lesions are N3-methyladenine, N3methylguanine, and N7-methylguanine, which are repaired
by base excision repair (BER; ref. 8). The minor lesion O6methylguanine (O6MeG) is repaired by O6MeG-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT; ref. 9). MGMT is a key node in resistance of tumor cells to methylating agents (10); thus,
MGMT overexpression protects (11) and MGMT inhibition
greatly sensitizes toward alkylation-induced cell kill (12).
Killing by TMZ of cancer cells is executed by apoptosis, and
it has been shown that both the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 extrinsic
and the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway can be triggered
(13). O6MeG does not trigger apoptosis directly; it requires
DNA mismatch repair (MMR; ref. 14). A current model
states that during DNA replication, O6MeG erroneously
pairs with thymine (15). The O6MeG/T mismatch is recognized by the heterodimer MSH2/MSH6 that recruits PMS2/
MLH1 (16). Therefore, loss of MMR or change in MMR
expression leads to changes in resistance of tumor cells to
methylating agents (17, 18). During DNA replication, MMR
causes persistent single-stranded gaps in the DNA (19) that
give rise to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 20). The
cell tolerates these DSBs by homologous recombination,

IFN-b and Valproic Acid Sensitize Melanoma Cells to Temozolomide

whereas nonhomologous end-joining only plays a minor
role in protection (21).
IFNs are cytokines (22) that are produced in response to
infection. There are 2 groups of IFNs, type I (IFN-a and -b) and
type II (IFN-g). Type I IFNs bind to the same receptor, which
leads to activation of the Janus-activated kinase/STAT signaling pathway and changes in gene expression (23). IFNs on
their own have cytotoxic effects in cancer cells, including
melanomas. The anticancer effect in melanoma cells has been
ascribed to the inhibition of cell growth (24) and the induction
of apoptosis (25). In one trial where IFN-a was administered
concomitantly with TMZ, the rationale was that IFN would
cause immunosensitization of the tumor (6).
In addition to any effects IFN may have on the immune
system, it may also have a direct impact on TMZ-induced cell
kill, which has to date not been addressed in preclinical
studies. Here, we show that p53 wild-type (p53wt) melanoma
cells are refractory in death receptor–induced apoptosis
despite the induction of Fas/CD95/Apo-1 expression following
TMZ, which is due to silencing of procaspase-8 in these cells. A
single IFN-b pretreatment could reactivate procaspase-8
expression and greatly ameliorated the response to O6MeG
when the cells were treated with TMZ, in vitro and in melanoma xenografts. The expression of procaspase-8 by IFN-b
could further be enhanced by the addition of the histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), which leads
to a significant sensitization of melanoma cells in vitro and in
melanoma xenografts. The data provide a rational basis for the
coadministration of the apoptosis modulators IFN and VPA
together with methylating anticancer drugs and suggest new
therapeutic interventions.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
All cell lines (D05, D14, RPMI7951, and A375) were
described previously (26, 27). A375 was from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), RPMI7951 from The German Cell
Culture Depository (DSMZ), and D05 and D14 were from C.W.
Schmidt (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Queensland, Australia) and checked there (28) and in the laboratory of
Dr. W€
olfel (Mainz). All cell lines were checked for mycoplasma
contamination before experimental use. Cells were cultivated
at 5% CO2, 37 C in humidified atmosphere. D05 and D14 cells
were cultivated in RPMI-1640, whereas RPM-I7951 and A375
were cultivated in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium. In all
cases, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
mg/mL streptomycin were present. D05 and A375 cells are
p53wt, whereas D14 and RPMI7951 cells are p53mt (26).
Drugs and drug treatment
IFN-a (interferon alfa-2a, Roferon-A) was from HoffmannLa Roche AG. IFN-b (interferon beta-1a, Rebif) was from
Merck Serono. VPA (Sigma) stock solution (100 mmol/L)
was prepared in distilled sterile H2O. TMZ (Schering-Plough)
and FM (Muphoran) were prepared and handled as described
(13, 26). A preincubation with 300 IU/mL IFNs for 24 hours
followed by medium change to remove IFNs was done before

www.aacrjournals.org

TMZ, FM, or g-ray (IR) treatment. Pretreatment of cells with
VPA (1 mmol/L for 168 hours, replacing the medium and
adding fresh VPA approximately every 48 hours) was done
followed by medium change to remove VPA before TMZ
addition. To deactivate the MGMT protein, O6-benzylguanine
(O6BG; ref. 29) was added to the cells (final concentration 10
mmol/L) 1 hour before drug treatment. Ionizing irradiation
was done by a Cs-137 source at 3.75 Gy/minute. Fas/CD95/
Apo-1 activating antibody (APO-1-3, Alexis Biochemicals,
Axxora Deutschland GmbH) was used at a dose of 25 ng/
mL along with 25 ng/mL protein A. TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (SuperKillerTRAIL, Alexis Biochemicals,
Axxora Deutschland GmbH) was used at a dose of 25 ng/mL.
Isolation and stimulation of primary human
lymphocytes
The isolation of lymphocytes from buffy coat blood and
stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (BD PharMingen)
have been described previously (30).
Quantification of apoptosis
The analysis of the sub-G1 fraction and the analysis of
Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double-stained cells by flow
cytometry have been described previously (13, 31).
Transfection of melanoma cells with MGMT, DN-FADD,
and siRNA against procaspase-8
Stable MGMT transfectants were generated by cotransfection of D05 cells with the mammalian expression vector
(pSV2MGMT) harboring the MGMT gene as described previously (11) and the pSV2neo plasmid for selection. Stable
dominant-negative FADD (DN-FADD) transfectants were generated in D05 and A375 cells by using the pcDNA3-FADD-DN
plasmid, as described previously (32). Stable transfectants
with siRNA targeted toward procaspase-8 were generated
by transfecting the previously described plasmid (33) in
A375. Following selection, surviving clones were tested for
protein expression by Western blot.
Preparation of protein extracts and MGMT activity
assay
Protein extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis
and MGMT activity testing as described (13). MGMT activity
was determined as described (34).
Immunoblotting
SDS-PAGE was done as described (13, 31). Antibodies used
were anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-8 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-9 (Cell
Signaling), anti-FADD (Calbiochem, Merck), anti-Fas (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MSH2 (Oncogene), anti-MSH6 (BD
Pharmingen), anti-MLH1 (Santa Cruz), anti-PMS2 (BD Pharmingen), anti-MGMT (Chemicon International, Inc.), and antiERK2 (extracellular signal regulated kinase 2; Santa Cruz).
Immunofluorescence labeling and microscopy
Immunofluorescence labeling of gH2AX foci was done as
described (21). The antibodies used were anti-gH2AX

initiated by injecting 8  106 cells in the right and left flank
and the treatments began when tumor volumes reached a
suitable value. Four animals each were assigned to the different groups and tumor volume was standardized across the
groups. The mice received 1 dose intraperitoneally (i.p.) of
TMZ (150 mg/kg). One hour prior to TMZ injection, all mice
received O6BG, 30 mg/kg i.p. Animal weights and tumor
volumes were measured at indicated times following TMZ
injection. A total of 2 groups that received IFN-b and VPA
pretreatment were treated as follows. Six days preceding
O6BG/TMZ injection mice were injected i.p. once daily with
500 mg/kg VPA. One day preceding O6BG/TMZ injection mice
were injected i.p. with 2  105 IU IFN-b. The in vivo experiments were done twice, once with female mice and once with
male mice.

Results and Discussion
IFN-b sensitizes melanoma cells to TMZ-induced
apoptosis
The studies were initiated with cell lines well characterized
as to their p53 status (26). In the p53wt cell line D05, IFN-a
and IFN-b caused significant sensitization to TMZ (P ¼ 0.03
and P < 0.0001 for IFN-a and IFN-b, respectively) when MGMT
was depleted with the specific MGMT inhibitor O6BG (Fig. 1A).
When O6BG was omitted, D05 cells showed sensitization
toward TMZ only following IFN-b pretreatment (P ¼
0.0012). In p53mt D14 cells, IFN-a and IFN-b had a very weak
sensitization effect on TMZ, which was significant for IFN-b
(P ¼ 0.002) when depleting MGMT with O6BG. Activation of
caspase-3 and -7, the apoptosis executing caspases, was also
enhanced following IFN-b pretreatment in D05 cells (Fig. 1B).
For the chloroethylating anticancer drug FM, a significant
increase in sensitivity was observed only in p53wt D05, but not
in p53mt D14 cells pretreated with IFN-b and O6BG (P ¼ 0.024;
Fig. 2A). Interestingly, no sensitization was found following
treatment with IR (4 or 10 Gy) in D05 and D14 cells (Fig. 2B). A
comparison of IFN-a and IFN-b revealed that IFN-b is more

IFN-b sensitizes p53wt melanoma cells to the
apoptosis-inducing TMZ lesion O6MeG
In our previous study with brain tumor cells, we have
shown that p53 has a significant impact on the cytotoxic
response of glioma cells to TMZ by upregulating the Fas/
CD95/Apo-1 receptor (13). The gene encoding Fas/CD95/
Apo-1 harbors a p53 binding site in its promoter, and
therefore, is subject to regulation by p53 (35). Thus, in

effective than IFN-a in sensitizing melanoma cells to alkylating agents (Fig. 1A and B).
To determine whether sensitization to TMZ is specific for
melanoma cells, we repeated the experiments with a nonmalignant cell type known to undergo O6MeG-triggered apoptosis effectively (30). We chose primary human lymphocytes
isolated from peripheral blood (PBLC). These lymphocytes
were not proliferating, or were stimulated to proliferate with
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody. Methylating agent–induced
apoptosis was only observed in proliferating lymphocytes
once MGMT was depleted, as observed previously (30).
IFN-b had no sensitization effect in both stimulated and
nonstimulated PBLCs (Fig. 2C). Collectively, the results show
that IFN-b sensitizes melanoma cells, but not nontumor cells
such as PBLCs, to TMZ.

glioma cells, the apoptotic response on methylating agents
is clearly p53-dependent (13, 36). In contrast, in melanoma
cells, TMZ-induced apoptosis was not stimulated by p53
(26). Because the most significant sensitization of IFN-b to
TMZ was observed in the p53wt melanoma cell line, we
determined whether p53 is required for this effect. To this
end, we compared the apoptotic response of a panel of
melanoma cell lines differing in their p53 status treated
with TMZ, with or without IFN-b pretreatment. The p53wt
cell lines were D05 and A375, whereas the p53mt cell lines
were D14 and RPMI7951 (27, 37). Data in Fig. 3A show the
x-fold increase in TMZ-induced apoptosis with IFN-b pretreatment compared with TMZ without IFN-b. A significant
increase in apoptosis level in the p53wt cells (up to 4-fold)
was observed for D05 and A375, but not for the p53mt cells
D14 and RPMI7951 (Fig. 3A). The data are taken to indicate
that the sensitization effect of IFN-b in TMZ-treated melanoma cells is dependent on p53, which is of interest as most
malignant melanomas express p53wt (38–40).
TMZ, similar to DTIC, is a genotoxic anticancer drug that
induces a broad spectrum of DNA alkylation lesions. Theoretically, IFN-b may sensitize melanoma cells to different DNA
methylation lesions. To determine whether sensitization to
TMZ by IFN-b is related to the specific adduct O6MeG, we

compared isogenic D05 cells by expressing different levels of
MGMT following transfection, that is, approximately 200 up to
800 fmol/mg protein (Fig. 3B; for MGMT protein in the stable
MGMT transfectants, see the blot in this figure). Under MGMT
expressing conditions, the sensitization of D05 cells by IFN-b
was completely abrogated, whereas inactivation of MGMT
with O6BG in both parental and MGMT-transfected cells
greatly sensitized cells to the combination treatment with

4154

IFN-b and TMZ (Fig. 3C). These results obtained with MGMTtransfected cells clearly show that sensitization of melanoma
cells to TMZ by IFN-b is due to the TMZ-induced DNA
damage O6MeG.

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

IFN-b does not influence MGMT and MMR protein
expression or DSB formation in melanoma cells
following TMZ treatment
The DNA adduct O6MeG is dependent on MMR for conversion into toxic DSBs and, therefore, MGMT, MMR, and
DSBs are determinants of O6MeG-induced cell kill (10, 41).
Due to this, we ascertained whether IFN-b has an influence on
these parameters by determining MGMT and MMR protein
expression and DSBs arising from the processing of O6MeG.
Treatment of D05 and D14 cells with 300 I.U./mL IFN-b
neither had an influence on the expression of MGMT nor
the MMR proteins MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1 (Fig. 4A).
Since the processing of O6MeG gives rise to the formation of
DSBs (20, 30), which was also recently shown for melanoma
cells (26), we determined whether sensitization of melanoma
cells by IFN-b is related to gH2AX foci formation. TMZ
induced gH2AX foci, which was shown 24 up to 72 hours
following treatment, and IFN-b had no significant effect on the
gH2AX foci level (for representative example Fig. 4B, and for
quantification Fig. 4C). We infer that IFN-b neither has an
impact on the repair of O6MeG lesions by MGMT nor the
conversion of O6MeG/T lesions into DSBs.
IFN-b induces procaspase-8 expression and thereby
reactivates the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 apoptotic pathway
Since no difference in repair and O6MeG processing could
be detected in the presence or absence of IFN-b, we reasoned
that IFN-b might increase the effectiveness of triggering the
apoptotic pathway following O6MeG induction. In p53wt
glioma cells, it is known that TMZ can activate the Fas/
CD95/Apo-1–dependent death receptor along with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, whereas in p53mt cells, only the
mitochondrial pathway is activated (13). As shown in Fig. 5A,
in the p53wt melanoma cell lines D05 and A375, TMZ caused
upregulation of the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 receptor, which is
expected as the gene encoding Fas/CD95/Apo-1 harbors a
p53 binding site in its promoter and is subject to regulation by
p53 (35). In the p53mt cell lines D14 and RPMI7951, no
increase in Fas/CD95/Apo-1 was detected. We also observed
that cells exhibiting both p53wt (D05) and p53mt (D14) status
activated the mitochondrial apoptosis marker caspase-9 following TMZ treatment, as shown by the increase in the
activated fragments of this caspase (Fig. 5A).
As the effect of IFN-b was different in p53wt and mutant
cells, we surmised that the death receptor-associated procaspase-8 could be involved. Therefore, we checked its
expression following IFN-b treatment in both cell types.
In the D05 and A375 cells, IFN-b caused a clear upregulation

RPMI7951, no procaspase-8 upregulation was observed
(Fig. 5B). We should note that D14 and RPMI7951 cells
already express procaspase-8 that could not be further
enhanced by IFN-b. Obviously, the basal procaspase-8 level

in these cells has no impact on TMZ-induced killing, which
is explained by the lack of basal expression and upregulation
of the death receptor in these p53mt cells (see Fig. 5A).
Epigenetic downregulation of procaspase-8 gene expression
has been shown in several tumors, which is presumably due
to promoter methylation (42, 43). IFN-b may be effective in
demethylating the procaspase-8 promoter or stimulate its
expression. Thus, it has been shown that IFN-a (44) and
IFN-g stimulate procaspase-8 expression and the promoter
of procaspase-8 contains an IFN-response element (45).
If procaspase-8 is the limiting factor in preventing the
effective activation of the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 apoptosis pathway,
inactivating the pathway as a whole or knocking down procaspase-8 should abolish the sensitization to TMZ following
IFN-b pretreatment. Both options were tested: Fas/CD95/
Apo-1–dependent activation of the death receptor pathway
was prevented by stable transfection of D05 with DN-FADD
and procaspase-8 was knocked down in A375 cells. DN-FADD
clearly decreased the effectiveness of IFN-b in sensitizing D05
cells to TMZ (Fig. 5C), whereas knockdown of procaspase-8
completely abolished the sensitization of A375 cells by IFN-b
to TMZ (Fig. 5D). Collectively, the data provide evidence that
IFN-b sensitizes melanoma cells to TMZ due to the upregulation of procaspase-8, thereby reactivating the cells ability to

utilize the death receptor apoptosis pathway following O6MeG
induction in MGMT deficient/depleted cells.
Both the induction of Fas/CD95/Apo-1 by TMZ and the
upregulation of procaspase-8 by IFN-b are required for
the sensitization observed during combination
treatment
Having shown that the silenced death receptor pathway can
be reactivated in p53wt melanoma cells by IFN-b, we asked
whether stimulation of the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 receptor by an
external ligand would be able to ameliorate the TMZ response
in the presence or absence of IFN-b. We made use of nontransfected and DN-FADD–transfected D05 cells to substantiate the killing effects that were brought about by the death
receptor. Treatment with Fas/CD95/Apo-1 activating antibody (AB) did not induce apoptosis significantly, whereas
treatment with AB plus IFN-b or AB plus TMZ was effective
(Fig. 6A). The strongest response was observed when the AB
was administered after TMZ in IFN-b pretreated cells. Similar
results were obtained with A375 cells (Fig. 6C). We should note
that in A375 cells, treatment with IFN-b plus AB did not
induce apoptosis significantly, whereas the inclusion of TMZ
caused a dramatic apoptotic response. This is likely due to the
low basal Fas/CD95/Apo-1 receptor status of A375 cells

Figure 5. IFN-b reactivates the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 apoptosis pathway by upregulating procaspase-8, thereby sensitizing p53wt melanoma cells to TMZ.
A, FasCD95/Apo-1 receptor (Fas-R) expression in D05, A375, D14, and RPMI7951 cells. Caspase-9 activation in D05 and D14 cells occurred at
indicated times. Cells were treated with O6BG and 50 mmol/L TMZ and analyzed by Western blot. Fas-R expression was determined 72 hours after TMZ.
Caspase-9 activation was confirmed by the appearance of the active cleaved fragments. ERK2 was used as loading control. B, Western blot analysis
of IFN-b–induced procaspase-8 expression in D05, A375, D14, and RPMI7951 cells. The expression was quantified and set in relation to the control not treated
with IFN-b. For quantification, ERK served as loading control. C, induced apoptosis in D05 and DN-FADD–transfected D05 cells occurred at indicated
times following O6BG and 50 mmol/L TMZ treatment in the absence or presence of IFN-b pretreatment determined by the Annexin V/PI method. Insert, Western

(Fig. 5A), which needs to be upregulated by TMZ. In p53mt
D14 cells, sensitization by the activating antibody did not
occur, either in the presence or the absence of TMZ and IFN-b
(Fig. 6B), showing that the slight sensitization of D14 cells
by IFN-b (see Fig. 1A) does not rely on Fas/CD95/Apo-1.
Induction of procaspase-8 by IFN-b should also influence
Fas/CD95/Apo-1–independent apoptosis, for example, by
administering TRAIL, which activates a different group of
receptors, DR4 and DR5. This was, in fact, observed: Pretreatment with IFN-b sensitized all melanoma cell lines tested to

greatly sensitizes p53wt melanoma cells to TMZ due to
reactivation of the Fas/CD95/Apo-1 pathway by upregulation
of procaspase-8.
VPA greatly ameliorates the sensitization of melanoma
cells by IFN-b in vitro
Is it possible to further increase the procaspase-8 level and

VPA, IFN-b, or both. As shown in Fig. 7, IFN-b on its own
caused increase of procaspase-8 protein expression, whereas
VPA on its own did not. When D05 cells were pretreated with
IFN-b and VPA, a very strong increase in procaspase-8
expression was observed (Fig. 7A; for quantification see
the induction factor). The combinations of IFN-b and
VPA pretreatment also greatly sensitized D05 cells to lowdose TMZ (30 mmol/L; Fig. 7B). The data revealed that
combining IFN-b and VPA was more effective than the
single treatments in enhancing the killing effect of TMZ
in melanoma cells.

IFN-b and VPA ameliorate the anticancer effect

To ascertain whether the findings can be translated to the
melanoma cell growth in vivo, we determined the effect of
A375 cells grown s.c. in nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. First, we analyzed
whether the enhanced sensitivity of IFN-b pretreated cells
would have an influence on melanoma cell growth treated
with TMZ in vivo. Tumor sizes were determined 20 days after
TMZ treatment. IFN-b on its own had a slight effect on tumor
growth. A single treatment with TMZ (150 mg/kg) delayed
tumor growth, whereas TMZ in combination with a single

conditions. D, model for the
sensitization of melanoma cells to
TMZ by IFN-b and VPA. Following
methylation of DNA by TMZ,
O6MeG is converted into DSBs in
a DNA synthesis and MMRdependent manner. These DSBs
then activate apoptosis via the
intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
The Fas-dependent extrinsic
pathway relies on the p53provoked expression of Fas-R.
Fas-triggered apoptosis cannot,
however, be effectively activated
because melanoma cells express
low levels of procaspase-8. By
pretreating melanoma cells with
IFN-b and VPA, the procaspase-8
protein levels are restored and Fas
can successfully activate the
caspase cascade and apoptosis
can progress successfully. In p53
mutant cells, preexisting
procaspase-8 is not effective
because these cells are impaired
in Fas-R upregulation.

IFN-b pretreatment showed improved tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 7C, left). Thus, IFN-b sensitizes melanoma cells both
in vitro and in vivo. Second, we determined the effect of

IFN-b and Valproic Acid Sensitize Melanoma Cells to Temozolomide

showed significant tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 7C, right). At
the end of the investigation period, IFN-b improved the
reduction of tumor size by approximately 25% compared with
animals treated with TMZ/O6BG only, whereas IFN-b plus
VPA caused a significant improvement by approximately 45%.
Similar to what was observed in vitro, the treatments were
most effective when VPA and IFN-b were applied concomitantly prior to TMZ compared with pretreatment with IFN-b
alone. A model is shown in Fig. 7D. We are aware that the
pathways evoked by combining VPA and IFN-b are complex,
and therefore we cannot exclude that additional mechanisms
become activated by concomitant treatment with the drugs,
but it is reasonable to posit that reactivation of the Fas/CD95/
Apo-1 pathway is most critical for eliciting a killing response
triggered by the TMZ/DTIC–induced DNA adduct O6MeG.
For TMZ and DTIC, MGMT is a key factor in drug resistance
(10). MGMT can be inactivated nearly to completion by O6BG
and O6-(4-bromothenyl)guanine (O6BTG), both currently
included in clinical trials (47). A recently published trial,
however, showed no benefit for melanoma patients receiving
TMZ concomitantly with O6BTG (48). In light of our current
data, it is pertinent to conclude that melanomas cannot
respond to TMZ/dacarbazine-based chemotherapy because
the death receptor pathway is silenced due to lack of procas-

pase-8. This causes melanoma cells to undergo apoptosis in
response to O6MeG via the less accessible mitochondrial
pathway, making them in fact refractory to chemotherapy
(13). The data presented here suggest a clinical trial in which
reactivators of caspase-8, namely, IFN-b and VPA, should be
administered prior to O6BG/O6BTG and TMZ/DTIC.
