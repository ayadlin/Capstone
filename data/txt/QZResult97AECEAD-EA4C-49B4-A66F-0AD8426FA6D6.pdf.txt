Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Disruption of glandular architecture associates with poor clinical outcome in high grade colorectal
cancer (CRC). PTEN regulates morphogenic growth of benign MDCK cells through effects on the
Rho-like GTPase cdc42. This study investigates PTEN-dependent morphogenesis in a CRC
model. Stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of PTEN in Caco-2 cells influenced
expression or localization of cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inhibited
cdc42 activation. Parental Caco-2 cells formed regular hollow gland-like structures (glands) with a
single central lumen, in three dimensional (3D) cultures. Conversely, PTEN-deficient Caco-2
ShPTEN cells formed irregular glands with multiple abnormal lumens as well as intra- and/or
inter-cellular vacuoles evocative of the high grade CRC phenotype. Effects of targeted treatment
were investigated. Phosphatidinylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) modulating treatment did not affect
gland morphogenesis but did influence gland number, gland size and/or cell size within glands.
Since PTEN may be regulated by the nuclear receptor PPARγ, cultures were treated with the
PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. This treatment enhanced PTEN expression, cdc42 activation and
rescued dysmorphogenesis by restoring single lumen formation in Caco-2 ShPTEN glands.
Rosiglitazone effects on cdc42 activation and Caco-2 ShPTEN gland development were attenuated
by cotreatment with GW 9662, a PPARγ antagonist. Taken together, these studies show PTENcdc42 regulation of lumen formation in a 3D model of human colorectal cancer glandular
morphogenesis. Treatment by the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone but not PI3K modulators rescued
colorectal glandular dysmorphogenesis of PTEN deficiency.

Introduction
The tumour suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
ten) regulates three-dimensional (3D) morphogenesis in a benign MDCK (Madin Darby
Canine Kidney) model of polycystic kidney disease, through effects on the Rho GTPase
cdc42 (1). Cdc42 partitions between cytosol and cell membrane fractions (2) and can be
activated for distinct functions at separate subcellular loci, by specific guanine nucleotide

exchange factors (GEFs) (3). In a SiRNA screen of 70 GEFs, the cdc42 GEFs Tuba and
intersectin 2 (ITSN2) were shown to have a key role in 3D MDCK epithelial morphogenesis
(4). Tuba promotes apical enrichment and activation of cdc42 (4) while ITSN2 colocalizes
with cdc42 close to the apical membrane (5). Once activated, cdc42 binds a protein complex
containing Par3, Par6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (6-8) to regulate polarized
growth (9). The cdc42/Par/aPKC polarity complex promotes GSK3β phosphorylation at
serine 9 (10) and triggers actomyosin flow (11). Suppression of cdc42 induces spindle
misorientation in adherent cells (12), disorganized apical membrane positioning and
formation of multiple irregular lumens or inter- or intra-cellular vacuoles in threedimensional (3D) epithelial cultures (13,14). PTEN regulates 3D epithelial morphogenesis
by recruitment and activation of cdc42 at the apical membrane (1) but associations between
PTEN, “morphogenic” GEFs and cdc42 activation remain unclear.
PTEN mutation or deficiency distorts glandular architecture during early neoplastic
progression (15) and associates with highly dysmorphic CRC phenotypes (16). However,
effective treatment of cancer dysmorphogenesis is lacking. While PTEN-deficient human
CRC (17) may represent a suitable target for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitory
therapy (18,19), PTEN also has crucial phosphatase-independent tumour suppressor
functions (20-22). PTEN expression may be upregulated by peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ (PPARγ), through PPAR responsive elements (PPREs) within the
PTEN promoter (23,24). The present study has used wild type (wt) Caco-2 CRC cells and a
subclone rendered PTEN deficient by stable transfection with short hairpin RNA (ShRNA;
Caco-2 ShPTEN cells), to investigate PTEN-dependent morphogenic signaling and test
effects of targeted treatment. This system models the incomplete post-transcriptional
suppression of PTEN by targeting miRNAs that characterizes human sporadic CRC (25).

Here we show that PTEN deficiency in neoplastic colorectal epithelium is associated with
impairment of cdc42-dependent morphogenic signaling. Stable knockdown of PTEN
inhibited expression and membrane localization of Tuba and promoted cytoplasmic
retention of ITSN2. While PI3K activating treatment enhanced membrane recruitment of
Vav2 in Caco-2 ShPTEN cells, ITSN2 and Tuba were unaffected. In 3D cultures, PTENdeficient (Caco-2 ShPTEN) cells formed gland-like structures (glands) with irregular apical
membrane positioning with respect to gland centres, multiple abnormal lumens and/or interor intra-cellular vacuoles. Transfection of cdc42 rescued Caco-2 ShPTEN gland
morphogenesis. Pharmacological modulation of phosphatidinylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling had limited effects on cdc42 activity, influenced gland number and size as well as
cell size within glands but did not affect the multilumen/vacuolar phenotype of PTENdeficient glands. Conversely, treatment of cells with the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (26)
enhanced PTEN expression, increased cdc42 activity and rescued Caco-2 ShPTEN gland
morphogenesis.
Taken together, these data indicate that PTEN has a key role in spatiotemporal coordination
of specific GEFs and cdc42, crucial for colorectal glandular morphogenesis. Since PPARγtargeted treatment but not PI3K modulators rescue defective gland formation, PPARγ
ligands may represent attractive candidates for further preclinical development as therapy
for CRC glandular dysmorphogenesis.

Results
PTEN deficiency impairs cdc42-signaling
To investigate effects of PTEN deletion or deficiency on cdc42 activity we used isogenic
PTEN expressing parental colorectal cells vs null or deficient subclones. PTEN−/−HCT116
cells were previously generated from parental PTEN+/+HCT116 cells using a highOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 September 07.

efficiency promoterless PTEN targeting vector (27). We generated a PTEN-deficient Caco-2
subclone by stable transfection of Caco-2 cells with PTEN ShRNA (28), then selected,
characterized and pooled PTEN deficient clones to generate the Caco-2 ShPTEN cell line
(Fig S1). Full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation on threonine 308 (Thr308) and
serine 473 (Ser473) residues (29) and we therefore assessed phosphorylation at both sites.
Parental PTEN+/+HCT116 and Caco-2 cells had lower Akt Thr308 and Ser 473
phosphorylation (pAkt) than PTEN−/−HCT116 or Caco-2 ShPTEN cells (Fig 1a), consistent
with PTEN suppression of PtdIns (3,4,5) P3 and PI3K-Akt signalling (30). Cdc42 activation
was greater in the parental lines than in PTEN-null or -deficient subclones (Figs 1a-c).
Once activated, cdc42 forms a polarity complex with Par6 and aPKC that promotes GSK3β
serine 9 phosphorylation (10). GSK3β phosphorylation (pGSK3β) was greater in the
parental PTEN+/+HCT116 and Caco-2 lines than in PTEN-null or -deficient subclones,
consistent with the greater cdc42 activity in those cells (Fig 1a). Cdc42 may be activated by
wounding (31) and PTEN+/+HCT116 cells maintained consistently higher cdc42 activity and
pGSK3β after monolayer wounding than PTEN−/−HCT116 cells (Fig 1d). To investigate the
cell-specificity of PTEN regulation of cdc42, we conducted PTEN SiRNA knockdown
studies in A-549 human lung and MDA -MB 235S human mammary epithelial cells. PTEN
SiRNA transfection suppressed cdc42 activity vs non-targeting (NT) SiRNA in these cells
(Fig S2). Hence, PTEN may enhance cdc42 activity in various epithelial cell types despite
its capacity for suppression of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3.
Effects of PI3K modulating treatment on cdc42 signaling

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To further investigate the role of PI3K-Akt signaling on cdc42 activity, we assessed effects
of PI3K activators or inhibitors. Background pAkt was greater in PTEN-deficient
PTEN−/−HCT116 cells or Caco-2 ShPTEN than parental cells and was modulated by EGF
or wortmannin treatment. The pre-treatment cdc42 activation state was greater in PTENexpressing cells. Taking this factor into account, quantitative effects of EGF on cdc42
activation appeared similar in presence or absence of PTEN (Figs 2a-2c). Treatment by
different PI3K-Akt activators or inhibitors (IGF vs LY294002) produced broadly similar
results (Fig 2d). These data indicate that cdc42 may be activated by PTEN and PI3K-Akt
signaling. pGSK3β serine 9 was also enhanced or suppressed by EGF/IGF or wortmannin/
LY294002 treatment respectively, in tandem with effects on cdc42 activation (Figs 2a-2d).
PTEN negative regulation of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 (32) impedes plasma membrane recruitment of
the cdc42 GEF Vav2 (33). To investigate the role of PTEN and PI3K signaling in membrane
recruitment of “morphogenic” vs “non-morphogenic” GEFs represented by Tuba and ITSN2
vs Vav2 respectively (4), we conducted cell fractionation experiments. Membrane and
cytosolic localization of GEFs were assessed in Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells treated by
vehicle only (VO) or PI3K modulating agents. Membrane accumulation of “morphogenic”
GEFs Tuba and ITSN2 was greater than that of the “non-morphogenic” GEF Vav2. Caco-2
cells showed greater expression of Tuba in both membrane and cytosolic fractions than
Caco-2 ShPTEN cells, after VO treatment. Caco-2 ShPTEN cells showed greater
cytoplasmic retention of ITSN2 than Caco-2 cells. For clarity, localization of Tuba and
ITSN2 GEFs are presented in separate membrane and cytoplasmic panels representing both
cell types, in Fig S2b. PI3K modulating treatment by EGF or wortmannin respectively
promoted or inhibited pAkt. EGF stimulation increased membrane recruitment of the “nonmorphogenic” GEF Vav2 in Caco-2 ShPTEN cells although ITSN2 and Tuba were
unaffected (Fig 2e). Taken together these findings show quantitative and localization
differences of cdc42 GEFs between Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN isogenic cells.
Furthermore, our findings show EGF mediated membrane localization of Vav2 in Caco-2
ShPTEN cells, but not of ITSN2 or Tuba (Fig 2e).

PTEN regulates 3D colorectal epithelial morphogenesis through cdc42

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To investigate the role of PTEN in epithelial morphogenesis, we raised 3D organotypic
cultures of Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells, in “Matrigel”. Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN
cells formed gland-like structures. Assessment by confocal microscopy was carried out
through gland midsections in over 10 fields in each experiment. Apical membranes and
basolateral margins/adherens junctions were identified by aPKC or E-cadherin
immunolabelling respectively. Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cultures formed 3D glands that
showed apical and basolateral localization of aPKC and E-cadherin (Fig 3a, Fig S3a,S3b).
Caco-2 glands predominantly comprised regular hollow spheres with a single central lumen
surrounded by an epithelial monolayer of uniform cells. Conversely, substantive
dysmorphogenesis was observed in Caco-2 ShPTEN glands. These contained multiple
abnormal lumens, inter- and/or intra-cellular vacuoles, showed irregular orientation of the
aPKC apical membrane marker in relation to gland centres and were formed from largesized epithelial cells (Figs 3a, 3b). We investigated the role of cdc42 in 3D morphogenesis
by transfection studies. As anticipated, transient transfection of Caco-2 or Caco-2 ShPTEN
cells in monolayer culture with wild type (wt) or constitutively active (CA) cdc42 constructs
upregulated cdc42 activity (Fig 3c). We then stably transfected Caco-2 ShPTEN cells with
GFP-labeled cdc42 constructs, for 3D culture. Transfection of wt cdc42 restored formation
of a single central lumen in >70% Caco-2 ShPTEN glands vs 43% and 37% for empty
vector (EV) or DN cdc42 transfections respectively (Figs 3d, 3e). Orientation of aPKC or Ecadherin markers in relation to cell apices or basolateral regions was unaffected by cdc42
transfections (Fig 3d). Since effects of cdc42 knockdown upon 3D Caco-2 morphogenesis
were shown in a previous study (13), those experiments were not repeated. Taken together,
these findings show a mechanistic link between PTEN, cdc42 and 3D morphogenesis in a
colorectal cancer model system.
Effects of PI3K modulating treatment on 3D epithelial morphogenesis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The structural morphology of colorectal cancer has major prognostic significance (34) and
its molecular regulatory framework could represent a novel target for therapy. Hence, we
assessed effects of PI3K activating or inhibitory treatment on 3D morphogenesis. Caco-2
and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells were incubated with EGF or wortmannin. Treatment was applied
either from the first day of 3D culture or after 10 days of culture. Neither regimen influenced
Caco-2 or Caco-2 ShPTEN gland lumen formation or orientation of the apical aPKC marker
with respect to gland centres (Figs 4a,4b). However, these PI3K activating or suppressive
treatments enhanced or suppressed epithelial cell size within Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN
glands (Fig S4a). We then tested a PI3K inhibitor with longer half life (PI-103) vs EGF or
medium only control. Treatment was administered from the first day of culture and renewed
every 48 hours. PI-103 treatment reduced the total number of Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN
glands formed (to 29% or 39% of control values), reduced gland size (Fig S4b) but did not
influence aberrant morphogenesis of Caco-2 ShPTEN glands (Fig 4c). Single lumen
formation was observed in 40% vs 40% vs 37% in Caco-2 ShPTEN glands treated by PI-103
vs EGF vs medium only control (Fig 4d).
Effects of rosiglitazone treatment on PTEN expression, cdc42 activation and 3D epithelial
morphogenesis
PTEN contains two peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) responsive
elements within its promoter region (23). In the present study, treatment with the PPARγ
ligand rosiglitazone (10 μM) enhanced expression of PTEN protein in a time-dependent
manner in both Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells. Effects were greater in the former (Fig
5a). The study dose was optimised in dose-response studies (Fig S5a). Rosiglitazone
treatment also enhanced cdc42 activation in both Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells although
these effects were inhibited by cotreatment with GW9662, a specific PPARγ antagonist (26)

(Fig 5b). Rosiglitazone treatment had a dramatic effect on lumen formation in Caco-2
ShPTEN glands, restoring a single central lumen in 60% Caco-2 ShPTEN glands vs 33% for
vehicle only treated controls (Fig 5c). Rosiglitazone rescue of lumen formation in Caco-2
ShPTEN glands was blocked by cotreatment with GW9662 (Fig 5d). In addition to effects
on morphogenesis, rosiglitazone treatment also suppressed the size of developing Caco-2
ShPTEN glands by 12 days of culture vs control (Fig S5b).

Discussion
In the present study, PTEN expressing PTEN+/+HCT116 and Caco-2 parental cells had low
Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 sites but greater cdc42 activity and greater
GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation than PTEN-null or -deficient subclones, in resting and
scratch-activated conditions. PTEN expression invoked higher cdc42 activity than PTEN
knockdown in various cell types. Previous studies have shown seemingly paradoxical effects
of PTEN on cdc42 signaling. PTEN dephosphorylates PtdIns (3,4,5) P3 (32) that promotes
plasma membrane recruitment of the cdc42-activating GEF Vav2 (33) and inhibits GTPbound cdc42 in murine fibroblasts (35). Conversely, PTEN promotes membrane recruitment
and activation of cdc42 during 3D MDCK epithelial morphogenesis and PTEN SiRNA
knockdown suppresses cdc42 activity in MDCK epithelial monolayers (1). Sophisticated
technologies have helped resolve this paradox and brought a new conceptual framework for
GTPAse function. As opposed to traditional concepts of a single polarization event governed
by total intracellular GTPAse activity, it is now recognised that spatially-restricted GTPAse
activity is regulated by specific GEFs for different functions, during cellular and
multicellular morphogenesis (3).

GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation can be enhanced by the cdc42/Par/aPKC polarity complex
(10) as well as Akt (36). Our findings suggest dominance of the former mechanism in our
model system. Although we cannot exclude some cell-specificity in these effects, our
findings accord with previous studies that identified a cooperative PTEN/GSK3β feedback
loop (37). GSK3β phosphorylates and destabilizes PTEN (37). Conversely, pharmacological
inhibition of GSK3β function by phosphorylation at serine 9 (38) may enhance PTEN
expression (39, 40). Hence, high GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation may permit high PTEN
expression. Furthermore, the well-characterized GSK3β inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl)
(41), enhances PTEN expression (40) and may promote GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation by
pAkt-independent mechanisms (42,43). Taken together, these studies are consistent with
PTEN-associated, pAkt-independent mechanisms of GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation, in
accord with our findings.
To explore PTEN-targeted therapy, we assessed effects of PI3K activation by growth factors
(EGF or IGF) (44) or inhibition by wortmannin or LY294002 treatment (29). EGF/IGF vs
wortmannin/LY294002 treatment respectively enhanced or suppressed cdc42 activation and
pGSK3β levels. Quantitative differences between parental PTEN+/+HCT116 and Caco-2
cells vs PTEN deficient subclones suggest cdc42 activation by both PI3K signaling and
PTEN expression. Growth factors and other upstream signals recruit cdc42 GEFs to convert
the GDP-bound form to active GTP-cdc42 (45). Specific GEFs can coordinate spatiotemporal cdc42 activity during a morphogenic response (3) by targeting the GTPAse within
macromolecular complexes, to key cellular subdomains (46). Rho-family GEFs have
pleckstrin- (PH) (46) and Dbl-homology (DH) domains (47) that mediate signal-dependent
membrane recruitment and GTPAse activation. For example, binding of the Vav2 PH
domain to membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 promotes PH-DH domain interactions (48) that
catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPAse activation (49). ITSN2 and Tuba are
dependent upon their DH domain function for cdc42 activation (50,4) but they differ from
other Dbl family Rho-GTPAse, in terms of their PH-DH domain interactions. The ITSN2

PH domain does not directly contact cdc42-substrate complexes, nor influence intrinsic DH
domain catalytic activity and its activation of cdc42 is PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-and PI3Kindependent (51). Tuba does not possess a PH domain (52) but instead contains an
evolutionarily conserved Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain (52) that binds
phosphatidylserine within the plasma membrane lipid bilayer (53, 54).

To investigate co-dependencies between PTEN, PI3K signaling and subcellular localization
of “morphogenic” and “non-morphogenic” GEFs, we conducted cell treatment and
fractionation studies. We found quantitative, localization and phosphatidylinositide-affinity
differences between specific cdc42 GEFs that could provide a rationale for our finding of
dual activation of cdc42 by both PTEN and PI3K signaling. Greater membrane and cytosolic
accumulation of Tuba and Vav2 associated with PTEN expression could thus enhance total
cdc42 activity in Caco-2 vs Caco-2 ShPTEN cells. Conversely, greater cytosolic retention of
ITSN2 in Caco-2 ShPTEN cells could impede ITSN2 colocalization with and activation of
cdc42 at the plasma membrane. PI3K activating treatment enhanced membrane recruitment
of Vav2 in Caco-2 ShPTEN cells but had no discernible effects on ITSN2 or Tuba. Hence,
the present study is consistent with PTEN dual regulation of cdc42 by phosphatasedependent and -independent effects on expression and membrane localization of specific
cdc42 GEFs

Elucidation of regulatory mechanisms of glandular dysmorphogenesis in high grade CRC
has been hampered by the scarcity of suitable model systems. Caco-2 cells retain the
capacity for 3D cell-cell interactions implicated in glandular architecture and provide a
suitable colorectal cancer morphogenesis model (55). In the present study, we found that
Caco-2 cells formed regular gland-like structures with a single central lumen, surrounded by
a uniform monolayer of polarized epithelial cells in 3D organotypic culture. Cell-cell
adhesion was maintained through adherens junctions identified by E-cadherin expression.
Furthermore, the aPKC apical membrane marker (56) formed a homogeneous continuous
interface with the gland lumen, in agreement with previous reports (13, 55). We found that
PTEN knockdown provoked a dramatic change in the organization of these gland-like
structures. Caco-2 ShPTEN glands formed multiple lumens, intra- and/or inter-cellular
vacuoles whose surfaces were positive for aPKC. Our findings resembled those induced by
SiRNA cdc42 knockdown in Caco-2 glands (13) although in our study, Caco-2 ShPTEN
glands were formed from large sized epithelial cells consistent with PTEN cell size
regulation (57,58).
Cdc42 has a central role in coordination of Caco-2 epithelial morphogenesis (13). SiRNA
knockdown of cdc42 disrupts mitotic spindle orientation, leading to inappropriate
positioning of apical membranes and secretion-driven development of multiple abnormal
lumens or vacuoles (13). Conversely, transfection of constitutively active (CA) cdc42
reverses the multilumen phenotype of cdc42-deficiency (4). In the present study, we show
that Caco-2 ShPTEN cells have low cdc42 activity that can be rescued by wt or CA cdc42
transfection. Furthermore, transfection of Caco-2 ShPTEN cells with wt cdc42 but not EV or
DN cdc42 also rescued 3D gland morphogenesis, restoring a single central lumen. Since
PTEN recruitment of cdc42 to the apical membrane is central to 3D morphogenesis (1), our
data suggests that PTEN could have a role in juxtapositioning of cdc42 with Tuba and
ITSN2, to promote cdc42 activation, spindle orientation and aPKC activation (4). In accord
with a previous report (13), we found that modulation of cdc42 activity did not affect aPKC
and E-cadherin localization in apical and basolateral cellular domains.
To assess effects of PI3K-Akt targeted treatment on 3D morphogenesis, we treated Caco-2
and Caco-2 ShPTEN cultures initially with EGF or wortmannin. Because of concerns about
cell survival effects of PI3-Akt modulating treatment (59), we applied treatment both at day

1 and after 10 days of culture. This treatment affected epithelial cell size within glands but
did not affect the single or multilumen phenotypes of Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN glands.
Wortmannin has a relatively short half-life in cell cultures (60) that could influence the
effectiveness of PI3K/Akt blockade. To address this concern, we repeated morphogenesis
experiments using PI-103, a longer acting potent inhibitor of class I phosphatidylinositide 3kinase (61). Addition of PI-103 every 48 hours effectively suppresses PI3K signalling in cell
cultures (61). In the present study we found that PI-103 treated glands were significantly
smaller and fewer than control, in line with suppression of the growth-promoting effects of
the PI3K/Akt pathway (32). However, we found that PI-103 did not rescue the abnormal
multilumen phenotype of Caco-2 ShPTEN glands.
In our Caco-2 ShPTEN model, PTEN suppression was incomplete and thus potentially
amenable to drug treatment. In this study, the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone enhanced PTEN
expression and cdc42 activation in Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cells, although effects were
greater in the former. Rosiglitazone treatment also rescued Caco-2 ShPTEN glandular
morphogenesis, restoring a single central lumen in 60% glands. While the PTEN level
induced in Caco-2 ShPTEN cells by rosiglitazone remained lower than in vehicle only
treated Caco-2 cells, subtle variations in PTEN level can have important biological
consequences in PTEN deficiency states (62). For example, low level PTEN can rescue
defective fetal tissue morphogenesis and embryonic lethality as effectively as normal
expression levels (63). To explore the PPARγ-dependence of rosiglitazone effects in our
model system, cells were cotreated with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (26). This step
effectively blocked rosiglitazone-mediated activation of cdc42 and rescue of Caco-2
ShPTEN glandular morphogenesis. Taken together, our findings are compatible with
rosiglitazone promotion of PTEN expression and enhanced PTEN-cdc42 mediated 3D
morphogenesis. While we cannot exclude PTEN-independent effects, rosiglitazone merits
further investigation as a targeted therapy for glandular dysmorphogenesis in cancer states.

cultured for intervals up to 14 days as previously described (13) but without cholera toxin
because of possible concerns about effects on GTPase activity (64). In treatment studies,
PI3K activators EGF (20 ng/ul), IGF (20 ng/ul) or inhibitors wortmannin (2 nM), LY294002
(5 μmol/L) or PI-103 (1.0 μM) were used. Rosiglitazone or GW9662 were used at
concentrations of 10μM each. Since the generation of glands by the above method was
relatively inefficient, signalling assays were conducted in Caco-2 and Caco-2 ShPTEN cell
monolayers.
Cell transfection

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mammalian plasmid transfections were carried out using Genejuice transfection reagent.
Cells were plated at 2×105 cells/35 mm or at 1×106/90mm dish 24 h before transfection,
then transfected with 500ng DNA/2×105 cells for all constructs. Transfections were carried
out according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were incubated with DNA-Genejuice
complexes for 48 h, before lysis and probing as described in Protein extraction and Western
blotting or antibiotic selection for stable transfections. Stable transfection of Caco-2 cells
with the previously validated PTEN ShRNA [pMKO.1 ShPTEN or pMKO.1 EV control;
(28) was carried out as previously described (28), with replication defective retroviruses
generated using the Phoenix™ retroviral expression system (Orbigen, San Diego, CA USA).
Briefly, Caco-2 cells were transfected with viral supernatant on 3 occasions, then incubated
in 1μg/ml puromycin for selection of ShPTEN positive subclones. Colonies surviving
puromycin selection were subcultured to 60-70% confluence, lysed and probed for PTEN
against GAPDH loading control. Clones deficient in PTEN expression were further
characterized in terms of AKT signaling and cdc42 activation. Five PTEN deficient clones
were pooled to generate the Caco-2 ShPTEN cell line (Fig S1). Caco-2 ShPTEN cells stably
transfected with pEGFP EV, -wt cdc42 and DN-cdc42 constructs were selected in 500 μg/
ml G418.
GST PAK cdc42-GTP pulldown
Cells were grown on 90mm dishes then lysed in buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4 and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and centrifuged at 12,500g for 10 min. p21 activated
kinase (PAK) binds specifically to active cdc42 and Rac. The GTP bound form of cdc42
was assayed by adding GST-PAK fusion protein coupled with gluthathione sepharose 4B
beads to 1mg of cell lysate. Beads were collected after 1 hr by centrifugation, washed x3 and
resuspended in Laemmli buffer with 1 mM DTT. Cdc42 activity was then assayed by
Western blotting, as outlined below. Experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Cell fractionation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cells were removed from culture dishes in detergent free lysis buffer (50mmol/L HEPES,
pH7.4) containing 50mmol/L NaCl, 1mmol/L MgCl2, 2mmol/L EDTA and 1mmol/L
Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors and sonicated (3 times 10 seconds each round). The cell
lysate was then centrifuged at 13000g for 15 minutes and the supernatant retained as the
cytosolic fraction. The pellets were resuspended in the same buffer, with 1% Triton X-100
and 0.1% SDS added and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C. Membrane fractions were then
obtained by centrifugation at 13,000g for 15 minutes and the insoluble pellets discarded.
Protein extraction and Western blotting
Proteins were resolved using gel electrophoresis, followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were probed using antibodies as indicated in the text.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Embedded glands were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes and processed for
immunofluorescence as previously described for MCF10A glands (65), with the following
modifications. Glands were incubated without the F(ab)2 fragment for secondary antibody
blocking and during immunolabelling with secondary antibodies. DNA was stained and
chamber slides mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector
Scientific, Belfast, NI). Sequential scan images were taken the midsection of glands at room
temperature using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope on a HCX PL APO lambda blue 63×
1.40 oil immersion objective at 1x or 2x zoom as indicated in the figure legends. Images
were collected and scale bars added using LAS AF confocal software (Leica). In stably
transfected Caco-2 glands, four colour confocal microscopy was used when the fluorescent
emission spectrum used for E-cadherin (secondary antibody label of Alexa Fluor 488)
overlapped with EGFP/tag fluorescence. The secondary label for E-cadherin was changed to
Cy5 antibody conjugate under these circumstances.
Image processing and statistical analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Fluorescence microscopy images were processed using Leica Fw4000 Imaging software and
cropped using Adobe photoshop (CS2). Confocal images were processed, merged and mean
area quantified using LAS AF Leica Imaging Software. Data analysis was carried out by one
or two way ANOVA using PASW statistics 18 and graphs drawn using Graphpad Prism 5.0.
Descriptive statistics were expressed as the mean ± sem.
