Attacking MALT1 for ABC-DLBCL therapy
Daniel Krappmann
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprises
the largest group of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
DLBCL can be classified according to their cellular origin
and patients with the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype have
an inferior prognosis relative to those with the germinal
center B-cell (GCB) subtype. Constitutive anti-apoptotic
NF-κB signaling is a hallmark of ABC-DLBCL. NF-κB
activation is caused by chronic active B-cell receptor
(BCR) signaling or constitutive MYD88 signaling.
Oncogenic mutations that contribute to pathogenesis
of ABC-DLBCL tumors have been identified in critical
components of both pathways (Figure 1) [1].
Target directed approaches for ABC-DLBCL therapy
have largely focused on the inhibition of upstream protein
kinase [2]. Chronic BCR signaling engages the adaptors
CD79A and CD79B in a Syk-dependent mechanism. Syk
is constitutively active in many B-cell lymphomas and a
clinical phase I/II trial using the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib
disodium (FosD, AstraZeneca) shows some response also
in DLBCL patients. However, most oncogenic mutations
in ABC-DLBCL occur further downstream revealing
that Syk may not be an optimal target. Downstream of
CD79A/B, Btk and PKCβ bridge proximal BCR signaling
events to the CARMA1 (CARD11)-BCL10-MALT1
(CBM) complex. Over 20% of ABC-DLBCL tumors carry
oncogenic mutations in CD79A/B. Indeed, the irreversible
Btk inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765, Pharamcyclics) and
the panPKC inhibitor sotrastaurin (STN) are inhibiting the
outgrowth of CD79 mutant ABC-DLBCL in preclinical
models [3, 4]. Furthermore, positive clinical responses in a
phase II trial were reported in relapsed/refractory DLBCL
with the selective PKCβ inhibitor enzastarin (LY317615,
Eli Lilly) [5]. However, none of these potential drugs
is able to target ABC-DLBCL tumors with lesions
downstream of PKCβ or in parallel pathways, such as
CARMA1 of MYD88, respectively.
Downstream of PKCβ the CBM subunit MALT1
has attracted great attention as a potential therapeutic
target [6]. MALT1 serves a dual role in NF-κB signaling
in response to antigen receptor stimulation. MALT1 is an
adaptor that recruits and activates the IκB kinase (IKK)
complex, the gatekeeper of canonical NF-κB. In addition,
MALT1 is a paracaspase with a caspase-like proteolytic
activity that is required for full NF-κB signaling and
survival of ABC-DLBCL cells. MALT1 cleaves and
thereby inactivates negative regulators of canonical NFκB, such as the tumor suppressor A20 and the NF-κB
subunit RelB which both counteract pro-survival functions

of canonical IKK/NF-κB signaling.
Two classes of MALT1 inhibitors have now been
identified that effectively and selectively inhibit the growth
of ABC- but not GCB-DLBCL in vitro and in vivo [7, 8].
Interestingly, the compounds are inhibiting MALT1 by two
very different mechanisms. Fontan et al have identified
a structurally new small molecule inhibitor (MI-2) that
is covalently modifying catalytic center of MALT1 [7].
MI-2 was tolerated in mice at the effective dose without
obvious signs of toxicity. Usually, irreversible inhibitors
require optimal pharmacokinetic properties for clinical
development, but recent advances for instance on the
irreversible Btk inhibitor ibrutinib reveal that a clinical use
may be possible. In a parallel study, we have identified the
phenothiazines-derivatives (PD) thioridazine, mepazine
and promazine as reversible MALT1 inhibitors [8]. PD
are not targeting the active site of MALT1, but exhibit
a non-competitive, allosteric mode of action. Mepazine,
thioridazine and promazine have a long medical history as
antipsychotics and sedatives drugs used for the treatment
of psychiatric disorders. Well-established toxicokinetics
and pharmacokinetics suggest that targeting MALT1
for cancer therapy by this class of compounds may be
safe and feasible. Further, medicinal chemistry could be
used to generate novel PD that are more potent MALT1
inhibitors, while reducing their neurological effects. Taken
together, both studies demonstrate that MALT1 inhibition
is a promising strategy for the treatment of ABC-DLBCL.
In fact, targeting MALT1 may possess some advantages
over the inhibition of upstream protein kinases. MALT1
inhibition also affects survival of CARMA1 mutant ABCDLBCL. Further, with an occurrence of 29% the MYD88
mutation L265P is the most frequent oncogenic mutation
in ABC-DLBCL. 65% of the MYD88-mutant ABCDLBCL tumors carry additional mutations in CARMA1
or CD79A/B and MALT1 inhibitors are toxic to ABCDLBCL with aberrant activation of both pathways [7, 8].
Thus, MALT1 inhibition indeed holds great promises for
the treatment of the majority of ABC-DLBCL.
Research on ABC-DLBCL provides a paradigm for
the power of using advanced diagnostic tools (e.g. gene
expression profiling and genome sequencing) to classify
lymphoma entities and to identify specific oncogenic
lesions. In parallel the generation of target directed
therapeutics will promote the development of more
personalized treatment protocols. Because of the various
oncogenic lesions and the possibilities of drug resistances,
there cannot be enough ‘smart’ drugs for ABC-DLBCL

signaling engages Syk, CD79A/B, Btk and PKCβ to induce
the recruitment of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM)
complex that triggers IKK/NF-κB activation. Activation of the
MALT1 protease promotes lymphoma survival by cleaving and
inactivating negative regulators of NF-κB, e.g. A20 and RelB.
In a subset of ABC-DLBCL NF-κB is activated by constitutive
signaling of the innate immune adaptor MYD88. Recurrent
oncogenic (asterisk) or inactivating (flash) mutations are
depicted. Drugs currently evaluated in preclinical and/or clinical
studies and their molecular targets are indicated.

may certainly enhance anti-tumor efficacy of the single

development.
