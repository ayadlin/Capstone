BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling is required for tumorigenicity and tumor
progression of gastrointestinal cancers. The authors previously reported the success of therapy for gastrointestinal
cancers using adenoviruses that expressed dominant-negative IGF-IR (IGF-IR/dn). In addition, it has been demonstrated that IGF-IR signaling affects vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in some other types of
tumors. The objective of the current study was to evaluate this interaction by studying the roles of IGF-IR in tumor
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and their implications for targeted therapy in gastric cancer. METHODS: The
impact of IGF signals on the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in a human gastric cancer cell, MKN45, and vascular
formation were assessed. The effects of IGF-IR/dn with or without bevacizumab on angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis,
and tumor suppression in mouse xenografts were assessed. RESULTS: IGFs induced the expression of VEGF ligands
and up-regulated in vitro vascular vessel formation. IGF-IR/dn reduced VEGF expression, reduced the activation of
both protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and reduced vascular formation, indicating that IGF-IR/dn inhibited tumor growth in mice by inhibiting both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. However,
IGF-IR/dn did not affect either blood sugar or body weight in these mice. The combination of IGF-IR/dn and bevacizumab was highly effective against these xenograft tumors, and only this combination resulted in the complete
regression of 43% of tumors, reduced the expression of VEGF, and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The current
results indicated that IGF-IR is involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the modulation of VEGF
ligand expression in the gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Targeting IGF-IR in combination with agents that block the

Gastric cancers are among the most lethal neoplasms in the world. Recent advances in endoscopic surgery, eg, endoscopic submucosal dissection, can cure a limited number of patients with early stage gastric cancer. However, it is diagnosed frequently in advanced stages with lymph node metastases, peritoneal dissemination, and hepatic involvement; and
there is a paucity of meaningful treatments in this situation. New therapeutic strategies, including molecular therapeutics,
are needed for those patients.
Altered signals from a variety of growth factor receptors are important for carcinogenesis and cancer development.
These signals modify cell cycle regulation, apoptotic induction, and interactions between cancer cells with their environment to promote the continuous growth potential of cancer cells.1 Type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGFCorresponding author: Yasushi Adachi, MD, PhD, First Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, S-1, W-16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8543,

IR) is a heterodimer of 2 a subunits (which contain the
extracellular domain) and 2 b subunits (with transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains).2 Binding of the
ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II, to IGF-IR causes receptor autophosphorylation and activates distinct downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase
(PI3-K)/protein kinase B 1(Akt-1) pathway.3 Usually,
activation of IGF-IR is tightly regulated by both IGF binding proteins and the nonstimulatory receptor, type 2 IGF
receptor.4-6
Dysregulation of the IGF/IGF-IR system has been
implicated in the growth of numerous tumors.7,8 Recent
studies have demonstrated that high serum IGF-I
increases the risk of developing several carcinomas,
including colon cancer.5 IGF-IR is important for tumor
maintenance as well as malignant transformation.9,10 It
has been demonstrated that the reduction of IGF-IR
induces apoptosis in tumors but produces only growth
arrest in untransformed cells,1 suggesting that receptor
blockade may have a significant therapeutic index. In
addition, IGF-IR knockout mice are viable, indicating
that relatively normal tissue development and differentiation occurs in the absence of IGF-IR.11
Expression levels of both IGF and IGF-IR are
increased in gastrointestinal carcinomas.12,13 Exogenous
IGFs stimulate the proliferation of gastric cancer cells,
and the blocking of IGF-IR inhibits tumor development.4,12,14,15 Intestinal fibroblast-derived IGF-II also
stimulates the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells in
a paracrine manner.16 Moreover, IGF-IR signaling is important in tumor dissemination through the control of adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis.17 These
findings suggest a potential basis for tumor selectivity in
therapeutic applications in gastrointestinal malignancies.
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
family consists of 5 glycoproteins, including VEGF-A and
VEGF-C, and binds to 3 structurally similar receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
and VEGFR3.18,19 In response to ligand binding, the
VEGFR tyrosine kinases activate multiple distinct downstream signaling pathways. VEGF-A is expressed as various isoforms because of alternative splicing, which leads
to mature 121-amino-acid, 165-amino-acid, 189-aminoacid, and 206-amino-acid proteins. VEGF165 is the predominant isoform and commonly is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. VEGFR2 expression is restricted
primarily to the vasculature and is the key mediator of

3136

VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis. VEGF-A promotes first
tumor neovascularization and then blood flow through
several mechanisms, including up-regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, increase in vessel permeability, and
formation of a lattice network for endothelial cell migration.20 VEGF-C binds to VEGFR3, which plays a crucial
role in postnatal lymphangiogenesis.21
Several important roles of VEGFs in the progression
of human gastric cancer have been reported. The expression of VEGF-A is correlated with tumor vascularity,20
and the frequency of hepatic metastases increased significantly among patients with VEGF-positive tumors.22 The
expression of VEGF-A also is correlated with a poor outcome and is an independent prognostic factor.20,22
VEGF-C induces the proliferation and dilation of lymphatic vessels, resulting in lymphatic invasion and lymph
node metastasis.21 It has been reported that VEGF-C,
VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 are prognostic markers that
may aid in the identification of patients who have a poor
prognosis after curative resection.23 VEGF-C and VEGFD also may induce neolymphatic vessel formation in experimental gastric tumors through the induction of
VEGFR-3 expression.24
The interaction between the IGF/IGF-IR axis and
the VEGF/VEGFR system in tumors, including gastrointestinal malignancies, also has been reported. It has been
demonstrated that both the expression of VEGF-A and
vessel abundance in colon tumors depend on the levels of
serum IGF-I25, and IGF-I induces the expression of
VEGF-A, which can promote the progression of cancer
by regulating neovascularization.26,27 Autocrine activation of the IGF-IR axis also significantly affects VEGF-A
expression and angiogenesis in human pancreatic
cancer.28,29
Recently, advances in molecular research in cancer
have brought new therapeutic strategies into clinical practice. Receptor tyrosine kinases are 1 new group of targets,
and both the VEGFRs and IGF-IR are candidate molecular targets in many human malignancies.8,19,30 Several
VEGF-targeted agents have been developed, including
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to VEGF/
VEGFRs, soluble VEGF receptors, and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs). The anti-VEGF MoAb bevacizumab is
approved for clinical use, and several possible approaches
to blocking IGF-IR signaling have been reported.31
MoAbs for IGF-IR are in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials.32 Smallmolecule TKIs for IGF-IR have been developed, including NVP-AEW541.33 We also have constructed 2 dominant-negative (dn) inhibitors for IGF-IR (IGF-IR/dn)

(IGF-IR/482st and IGF-IR/950st), which are active as
plasmids and recombinant adenovirus vectors in gastrointestinal malignancies, including colorectal, pancreatic,
gastric, and esophageal cancers.34-37 IGF-IR/482st encodes a truncated extracellular domain of IGF-IR (without
the transmembrane domain) and, thus, should result in a
secreted form that affects neighboring cells in addition to
the transduced cells (a bystander effect). We have
observed that IGF-IR/dn inhibits xenograft tumors in
nude mice.35,36
In the current study, we analyzed the impact and
mechanism of IGF-IR inhibition on tumor angiogenesis.
We also assessed the effectiveness of dual blockade of both
IGF-IR and VEGF on reducing tumor angiogenesis and
progression. In addition to the established effects of IGFIR blockade on apoptosis, these results establish the direct
involvement of this receptor in tumor vessel formation
and strengthen the rationale for using IGF-IR blockade in
the molecular targeted therapy of human gastric cancers.

aged 6 weeks, were purchased from Charles River (Yokohama, Japan). The care and use of mice were in accordance with our universityâ€™s guidelines.
Recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) that expressed
IGF-IR/dn (482 amino acids long: IGF-IR/482st and AdIGF-IR/482st) were generated as described previously by
homologous recombination.34 An adenovirus that
expressed the b-galactosidase gene was used as a control
(Ad-LacZ).
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain
Reaction
Total RNA from cells was isolated using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. Randomly
primed combinational DNAs were prepared from 1 lg of
total RNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Takara, Japan) and were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using synthesized oligonucleotides that were specific for VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as follows: for VEGF-A,
50 -GGA CAT CTT CCA GGA GTA CC-30 (sense) and
50 -GTT CCC GAA ACC CTG AGG-30 (antisense); for
VEGF-C, 50 -GA CTC AAT GCA TGC CAC G-30
(sense) and 50 -TTG AGT CAT CTC CAG CAT CC-30
(antisense); and for GAPDH, 50 -CAG CCG AGC CAC
ATC G-30 (sense) and 50 -TGA GGC TGT TGT CAT
ACT TCT C-30 (antisense). GAPDH served as an internal control of the reaction. PCR was carried out for 1 cycle
at 94 C for 4 minutes followed by 30 to 35 cycles at 94 C
for 30 seconds, at 55 C for 30 seconds, and at 72 C for
30 seconds.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were treated as indicated elsewhere in this report,
and cell lysates were prepared as described previously.34
Equal aliquots of lysate (100 lg) were separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and were immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene Hybond-P
membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill). Analyses
were performed using the indicated antibodies, and
bands were observed by electron chemiluminescence
(Amersham).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
MKN45 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-IGF-IR/
482st (multiplicity of infection Â¼ 30) for 48 hours; then,
the media was changed to 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(without fetal calf serum) overnight. The cells were treated
with IGF-I 50 nM for 5 hours; then, media were collected

and concentrated (50 times), and the cells were lysed separately. Concentrations of VEGF-A were measured using
the Human VEGF Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems).
In Vivo Therapeutic Efficacy in Established
Tumors
We evaluated the effect of adding Ad-IGF-IR/482st to
bevacizumab in established tumors. We injected 1  106
MKN45 cells subcutaneously into nude mice. After all
MKN45 tumors were palpable, 1 108 plaque-forming
units of adenovirus were injected intratumorally for 5
days. Both groups were then divided into pair-matched
bevacizumab-treated and control groups (n Â¼ 7 or 8 mice
per group), and 4 mg/kg bevacizumab or vehicle was
administered intraperitoneally twice weekly for 12 doses.
The mice were killed the Day 42, when tumors began to
cause clinically evident disability. Blood samples were
taken for testing. The greatest tumor dimensions were
measured serially with calipers, and tumor volume was
calculated using the following formula: tumor volume
(mm3) Â¼ (width2  length)/2.
Immunohistochemical Analysis
Sections (5 lm) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tumor xenografts were prepared. After deparaffinization,
the sections were pretreated with DakoCytomation Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) in a
microwave oven (10 minutes). Then, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked. Antibodies were applied after
blocking with normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with the anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Dako) followed by exposure to a diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride substrate (Dako).
Measurement of the immunostained area in photomicrographs was performed using the public domain
NIH Image software program (developed at the US
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md; http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/ accessed December 24, 2010).
The microvessel density (MVD) and the lymphatic
vessel density (LVD) were determined as described previously.23,38 In brief, MVD was examined in a blinded
manner by 2 independent observers. Each CD31-stained
or CD34-stained section initially was scanned using a
low-power objective ( 50 magnification) to identify the
most vascular areas (â€˜â€˜hot spotsâ€™â€™) in the intratumoural and
peritumoural stroma. Three hot spots were then assessed
at a magnification of  400 (field area Â¼ 0.28 mm2).

3138

Fields were arranged to maximize the ratio of stroma to
epithelium, and the numbers of CD31-positive or CD34positive cells or groups of cells in each field were counted.
A lumen was not required for a cell or a group of cells to
be included in the count. Vessels that were located < 1
mm from an ulcer or from an area of necrosis and vessels
that were located > 1 mm from the edge of the tumor
were excluded. The mean score was calculated. LVD also
was examined by counting LYVE-1â€“positive tumor
lymph vessel elements (4 to 5 fields per tumor) in a
blinded manner by 2 independent observers.
Assessment of Apoptosis
Sections (5 lm) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tumor xenografts were prepared. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed with an in situ
apoptosis detection kit (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The number
of TUNEL-positive cell was examined in a blinded manner by 2 independent observers. Seven non-necrotic areas
were selected at a magnification of  400, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in each field was counted.
In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay
MKN45 cells were seeded at a density of 8  104 cells per
well in 24-well plates. After 8 hours in culture, the cells
were infected with either Ad-IGF-IR/dn or Ad-LacZ at a
multiplicity of infection Â¼ 50. After a 48-hour incubation, the growth medium was replaced by serum-free
media supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin,
100 ng/mL heparin, 200 ng/mL bevacizumab, 75 ng/mL
IGF-I, or vehicle, and the cells were incubated for 12
more hours. Then, 2  104 HUVECs were seeded in
growth factor-reduced, Matrigel-coated, 24-well plates
(BD BioCoat plate; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford,
NJ). After 12 hours in culture, the HUVEC media were
replaced with MKN45 cell-conditioned media. After a
16-hour incubation, the cells were fixed and stained.
Tube formation was quantified by counting the number
of connected cells in 5 randomly selected fields at  200
magnification.
Colony-Forming Activity
MKN45 cells (3  103 cells per plate) were seeded onto
60-mm culture plates and incubated for 24 hours. Then,
the cells were treated with figitumumab and incubated for
another 14 days. After air drying, the cells were fixed with

Figure 1. The blockade of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) reduced tumor angiogenesis in subcutaneous tumors from
nude mice. (A) MKN45 subcutaneous tumors that were injected intratumorally for 5 successive days with an adenovirus (adeno)
that expressed dominant-negative IGF-IR (IGF-IR/dn) (solid circles) suppressed the growth rate significantly compared with
tumors that were treated with LacZ (which was used as a reporter gene that encodes the b-galactosidase enzyme) adenovirus
(ad-LacZ) (open circles; n Â¼ 12 per group; P Â¼ .0009). The final tumor size (mean  standard error) was 377  55 mm3 for IGFIR/dn-treated tumors and 1001  202 cm3 for LacZ-treated tumors. Arrows indicate adenoviral injection. (B) Immunostaining
with CD34 revealed that another dominant-negative inhibitor developed for IGF-IR, IGF-IR/482st, blocked neovascularization
(original magnification,  200). (C) The number of blood vessels was reduced significantly in IGF-IR/dn-treated tumors (P <
.0001). (D) The sizes expected for vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) isoforms VEGF165 and VEGF121 were 438 base
pairs (bp) and 306 bp, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that VEGF-A messenger

that contained  50 cells were counted.
Statistical Analysis
The results are presented as the mean  standard error
value for each sample. The statistical significance of differences was determined by using the Student 2-tailed t test
for 2 groups, a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
multiple groups, and a 2-factor factorial ANOVA. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

1A),36 the expression of CD34 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B). IGF-IR/dn significantly reduced
the number of blood vessels in MKN45 tumors in nude
mice (P < .0001) (Fig. 1C). The expression of VEGF-A
messenger RNAs also was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1D). Although 4 of 5 MKN45 tumors
(80%) that were treated with control adenovirus produced
VEGF-A, only 33% of IGF-IR/dn-treated tumors
expressed VEGF-A. This result indicates that IGF-IR/dn
reduces the expression of VEGF-A, which, in turn, may
underlie the observed reduction in the angiogenesis
potential of these tumors.

as a reporter gene that encodes the b-galactosidase enzyme. (C) Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis
revealed that IGF-I stimulated VEGF-A messenger RNA expression. The effects of several inhibitors and of IGF-IR/dn were
assessed. Although the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 did not affect ligand-induced up-regulation, the MAPK kinase 1 inhibitor PD95059, the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and IGF-IR/dn reduced
IGF-stimulated VEGF expression. DW indicates; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (D) Western blot analysis
revealed that IGF-I stimulated the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (pAkt), and extracellular regulated protein kinases

stimulated VEGF-A expression in culture (P Â¼ .0069)
(Fig. 2A), which was confirmed by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis also indicated that IGFIR/dn blocked the ligand-induced up-regulation of
VEGF-A (Fig. 2B).

To analyze the mechanism underlying the induction
of VEGF-A expression by IGF, we used several inhibitors.
Both a PI3-K inhibitor (wortmannin) and a MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) blocked ligand-induced VEGF-A activation; however, a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did

not (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis revealed that both
IGF-IR/dn and wortmannin blocked ligand-induced Akt1 phosphorylation and that both IGF-IR/dn and
PD98059 reduced IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of
ERKs (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that both the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway may play important roles in IGF-induced VEGF expression.
Dual Targeting Treatment for MKN45
Established Xenografts
To identify potential new treatment combinations for gastric cancer, we assessed the combined effect of IGF-IR/
482st and the antihuman VEGF MoAb bevacizumab on
subcutaneous MKN45 tumors in nude mice (Fig. 3A).
Both monotherapies (IGF-IR/dn alone and bevacizumab)
effectively inhibited tumor growth (P Â¼ .0203 and P Â¼
.0179, respectively; Fisher partial least-squares difference
[PLSD]). The combination treatment with both IGF-IR/
dn and bevacizumab inhibited tumor growth dramatically
(P Â¼ .0031), and only this combination resulted in complete regression for 3 of 7 tumors (43%). One tumor that
was treated with the combination disappeared on the 24th
day, others disappeared by Day 38, and there were no
tumors visible on dissection. Because the combined treatment did not affect either body weight or blood glucose
concentration in the mice at autopsy (Fig. 3B), both individual treatments and the combination did not reveal any
evidence of significant side effects.
To analyze the mechanism of tumor growth retardation, immunohistochemical examination and a TUNEL
assay were performed. Immunostaining for CD31
revealed that the number of tumor vessels was reduced
dramatically by each treatment (P < .0001; Fisher
PLSD). In the bevacizumab treatment group, IGF-IR/dn
had an additional effect on the prevention of tumor neovascularization (P Â¼ .0170). IGF-IR/dn reduced the
expression of VEGF-A in the growing MKN45 tumors
on nude mice (P Â¼ .0009) (Fig. 3C). Although bevacizumab alone did not affect the expression of VEGF-A, it did
strengthen the IGF-IR/dn-induced suppression of
VEGF-A (P Â¼ .0097). A TUNEL assay revealed that both
single agents induced apoptosis; moreover, the combination further up-regulated apoptotic induction (Fig. 3C).
The results indicate that IGF-IR blockade reduces the
production of VEGF-A and prevents tumor angiogenesis,
which leads to apoptotic induction and tumor growth retardation. Bevacizumab reduced tumor angiogenesis and
up-regulated IGF-IR/dn-induced suppression of VEGFA expression, leading to apoptosis and inhibition of tumor

growth. Therefore, IGF-IR/dn and bevacizumab augmented the effectiveness of each other.
Blockade of IGF-IR Reduced In Vitro Vascular
Formation and Colony Formation
To assess the effect of IGF-I on neovascularization, in
vitro vascular vessel formation assays were performed.
IGF-I induced in vitro vascular vessel formation of
HUVECs, although MKN45 cells were treated with bevacizumab (Fig. 4A,B). IGF-IR/dn reduced ligand-induced
vessel formation (P Â¼ .00147 compared with control, viral-infected cells that were treated with IGF-I alone
(Fisher PLSD); and the combination of IGF-IR/dn and
bevacizumab blocked ligand-induced vessel formation at
the same level as control, virus-infected MKN45 cells
without ligand treatment.
Next, we evaluated the effect of bevacizumab on colony formation (Fig. 4C). Although IGF-IR/dn reduced
colony formation (P < .0001), bevacizumab did not have
an affect on colony formation, as expected. The results
indicate that this MoAb mainly suppresses tumor angiogenesis and up-regulates apoptotic induction. Conversely,
IGF-IR/dn may play multiple, important, direct roles in
retarding tumor growth, including suppression of VEGFA expression, down-regulation of angiogenesis, induction
of apoptosis, blockade of vascular formation, and suppression of colony formation.
The Effect of IGF-IR/dn on
Lymphangiogenesis
To analyze the effect of another mechanism of IGF-IR/dn
blockade on the growth of subcutaneous MKN45 tumors
in nude mice,36 we used immunohistochemistry to assess
tumor lymphangiogenesis. LYVE-1, which is a specific
marker for lymphatic endothelium, revealed strong staining in control-treated tumors but not in tumors that were
treated with IGF-IR/dn (Fig. 5A). IGF-IR/dn reduced
the number of lymphatic vessels in MKN45 tumors in
nude mice (P < .0001) (Fig. 5B). The expression of
VEGF-C messenger RNAs also was analyzed by reverse
transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 5C). Although 6 of 11 MKN45
tumors (55%) that were treated with control adenovirus
produced VEGF-C, none of 6 tumors that were treated
with IGF-IR/dn expressed VEGF-C. This result indicates
that IGF-IR/dn reduces the expression of VEGF-C,
which, in turn, may underlie the observed reduced potential for lymphangiogenesis in these tumors.
We also immunostained lymphatic vessels and
VEGF-C in MKN45 tumors that had been treated with

108 plaque-forming units of Ad-IGF-IR/482st (n Â¼ 15; solid black circles and lines) or adenovirus that expressed the b-galactosidase gene (LacZ) (n Â¼ 16; solid gray circles and lines) were injected intratumorally on 5 successive days (arrows), and bevacizumab (solid circles) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) (open circles) was injected intraperitoneally 12 times on a twiceweekly schedule (arrowheads). Both bevacizumab alone (n Â¼ 8; solid gray circles) and the IGF-IR/dn adenovirus alone (n Â¼ 8;
open black circles) suppressed tumor growth (P Â¼ .0170 and P Â¼ .0203, respectively). Combined therapy (n Â¼ 7; solid black
circles) was the most effective (P < .0031 compared with control tumors and PBS-treated tumors; n Â¼ 8), and 3 of 7 tumors were
cured. (B) On Day 42, the mice were killed and weighed, and blood samples were taken for glucose measurement. There were no
significant differences in either body weight or serum glucose concentrations among the 4 groups. (C) Immunohistochemical
examinations for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (cluster of differentiation 31 [CD31]) and VEGF-A were performed.
The number of tumor neovessels was counted. Immunohistochemically positive areas of VEGF-A were then measured quantitatively using the NIH Image software program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md). The number of apoptotic cells was
counted using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays.

Figure 4. The effects of dual blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor (IGF-IR) on in vitro vascular vessel formation and colony formation are illustrated. (A) Representative photomicrographs

a reporter gene that encodes the b-galactosidase enzyme.  Indicates negative; Ã¾, positive. (B) This summary of in vitro vascular
vessel formation of HUVECs reveals that IGF-I induced in vitro vascular vessel formation, and an adenovirus (adeno) that
expressed dominant-negative IGF-IR (IGF-IR/dn) reduced ligand-induced vascular formation. Bevacizumab alone did not have an
affect on in vitro vascular vessel formation; however, it did enhance the effect of IGF-IR blockade. (C) Although IGF-IR/dn

the combination of IGF-IR/dn and bevacizumab.
Although bevacizumab did not affect LVD, IGF-IR/dn
reduced it dramatically (IGF-IR/dn vs control; P Â¼
.0004) (Fig. 5D). IGF-IR/dn also reduced the expression
of VEGF-C (P < .0001) (Fig. 5D), but bevacizumab did
not affect it.

DISCUSSION
The objective of the current study was to clarify the mechanisms by which IGF-IR/dn reduces the progression of
xenografted gastric cancers in mice.36 We determined that
blocking IGF-IR down-regulates VEGF ligand expression
Cancer

July 15, 2011

in gastric cancer cells and that this down-regulation
explains in part the reduction in both neovascularization
and lymphangiogenesis.
Several articles have reported that blockade of IGFIR may reduce angiogenesis through the reduction of
VEGF expression in gastrointestinal carcinomas, such as
colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. IGF-IR/dn-transfected colon cancer cells formed subcutaneous tumors in
nude mice with growth retardation, decreased proliferation, lowered VEGF expression and vessel counts, and
increased tumor cell apoptosis39,40 compared with controls. In addition, IGF-IR/dn-transfected cells failed to
form liver tumors after they were injected directly into the

tumors in nude mice. (A) Immunostaining of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) revealed that IGF-IR/
482st, an adenovirus (adeno) that expressed dominant-negative IGF-IR (IGF-IR/dn), blocked neolymphovascularization in the

(B) The number of lymphatic vessels was reduced significantly (P < .0001).

several subcutaneous tumors, and the adenovirus Ad-IGF-IR/dn suppressed its expression. GAPDH indicates glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase; bp, base pairs.

An IGF-IR inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, significantly

our knowledge, the current article is the first report that

IGF-IR blockade reduces tumor neovascularization by
blocking VEGF in gastric cancer.
We demonstrated that both the PI3-K/Akt pathway
and the MAPK pathway are important in both IGFinduced VEGF expression and tumor neovascularization
in gastric cancer, and these results are supported by previous studies in several tumors: IGF-1 induced hypoxia-

inducible factor 1-mediated VEGF-A expression, which
depends on MAPK and PI3-K signaling in colon cancer
cells.43 NVP-AEW541 diminished the activation of IGFIR, Erk, and Akt in pancreatic cancer.42 An IGF-IR
MoAb, CP751,871, caused the suppression of Akt phosphorylation and suppressed tumor-derived VEGF-A in
some sarcoma xenografts.44
VEGF-C/VEGF-R3 signaling plays a significant
role in lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis because
of its effects on lymphatic vessels. IGF-IR may be a positive regulator of VEGF-C expression and has been implicated in the control of lymphatic metastasis in Lewis lung
carcinoma subline M-27 cells that were transfected with
human IGF-IR combinational DNA.45 However, to our
knowledge, there are no reports about the effect of IGFIR on neolymphovascularization and VEGF-C expression
in human gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we have demonstrated that IGF-IR/dn blocked the expression of VEGFC and LVD in MKN45 tumors in mice. In accordance
with a previous study indicating that IGF-dependent
VEGF-C induction was abolished by LY294002 (84.6%)
and PD98059 (38%) in lung cancer cells,45 we observed
that both the PI-3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway
are important in IGF-induced VEGF-C expression. Conversely, IGF-1-induced lymphangiogenesis could not be
blocked by soluble VEGFR3 in a mouse cornea assay,
which suggests that IGFs may act as direct lymphangiogenic factors without requiring the VEGFR3 pathway in a
mouse cornea.46 Those phenomena have not been
reported in human cancer cells, so a greater understanding
of IGF-induced lymphangiogenesis may clarify these precise mechanisms.
To our knowledge, there are no reports of dual targeting therapy of the IGF/IGF-IR axis and the VEGF/
VEGFR axes for human malignancy. Bevacizumab is species-specific and lacks the ability to neutralize murine
VEGF-A. Because bevacizumab has an extremely weak
interaction with murine VEGF-A,47 bevacizumab should
block only human VEGF-A derived from the human gastric cancer MKN45 that grew in nude mice. Although bevacizumab does affect either VEGF expression or colony
formation, bevacizumab can block both VEGFR activation
and angiogenesis, suggesting that autocrine ligand production was the dominant activating signal in this system. In
agreement with a previous study,38 bevacizumab did not
affect either VEGF-C or lymphangiogenesis in gastrointestinal carcinomas. Conversely, IGF-IR/dn was able to suppress colony formation, VEGF ligand expression,
angiogenesis, and lymphovascular formation. Moreover,

Cancer

July 15, 2011

IGF-IR/dn was able to augment the effects of bevacizumab, such as reducing vascular formation and inducing apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this dual targeting
strategy is a promising candidate combination for patients
with gastric cancer, because we have demonstrated that the
combination of IGF-IR/dn and bevacizumab enhanced
each othersâ€™ effects and eradicated some tumors without
observed toxicity in these animal models. We previously
reported a positive feedback loop between the IGF/IGF-IR
axis and matrilysin in the progression and invasiveness of
gastrointestinal cancers.17 In the current study, we demonstrated that IGF-IR blockade can reduce both angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis, which are important processes
that contribute to the spread of gastric cancer. The results
indicate that IGF-IR-targeted therapy may be a strategy
that has direct antitumor and antimetastatic activity in
patients with gastric cancer. Moreover, the dual targeting
of IGF-IR and VEGF is a promising novel combination
for the treatment of gastric cancer.
