ABSTRACT
AZD1480 is a potent, competitive small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1/2 kinase which
inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth. Here we investigated the effects of
AZD1480 on the function of different immune cell populations in a melanoma model.
When MO4 tumor-bearing mice were treated with AZD1480 we observed a strong
inhibition of tumor growth as well as a prolonged survival. Moreover, a significant
decrease in the percentage of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was observed
after treatment with AZD1480. However, AZD1480 enhanced the suppressive capacity
of murine MDSCs while at the same time impairing the proliferative as well as the
IFN-γ secretion capacity of murine T cells. The addition of AZD1480 to co-cultures
of human MDSCs and T cells does not affect the suppressive activity of MDSCs but it
does reduce the IFN-γ secretion and the proliferative capacity of T cells. We showed
that although AZD1480 has the ability to delay the tumor growth of MO4 tumorbearing mice, this drug has detrimental effects on several aspects of the immune
system. These data indicate that systemic targeting of the JAK/STAT pathway by
JAK1/2 inhibition can have divergent effects on tumor growth and anti-tumor immune
responses.

INTRODUCTION

the field of oncology[3,4].
The link between inflammation and cancer has
been well established. Under normal physiological
conditions, inflammation is a self-limiting process, but
dysfunctions in one of the inflammatory pathways can
lead to pathogenesis and eventually to tumorigenesis[5].
The intracellular signalling pathways responsible for
the inflammatory process are very complex, implicating
dozens of molecules involved in several different
signalling pathways. However, it has become clear
that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) is a kind of master switch that is connected to
most signalling pathways related to both oncogenesis
and tumor-associated inflammation[6,7]. Activation of
STAT3 has been described in nearly 70% of solid and
hematological tumors, emphasizing the importance of

Conventional chemotherapeutic agents used for the
treatment of cancer patients act by exerting toxic effects
on all dividing cells, leading to severe damage of normal
tissue which results in side effects including but not
limited to myelosuppression, alopecia and gastrointestinal
problems. Therefore more specific therapies targeting
key elements that play a role in tumor initiation and
progression are being developed so as to specifically target
malignant cells with severely reduced side-effects[1,2].
There are over 20 small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors
currently approved or under investigation for the treatment
of human diseases. Inhibitors of protein kinases continue
to be the focus of drug discovery programs, especially in

RESULTS

STAT3 as a direct target in cancer therapy[8,9]. Activated
tyrosine kinases phosphorylate STAT3 (P-STAT3), which
in turn forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus, where
they directly regulate gene expression. In addition to
upregulating numerous genes involved in proliferation,
survival, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, STAT3
induces the expression of many cytokines, such as IL-6,
IL-10, TGF-β and VEGF, that are associated with cancerpromoting inflammation[10,11]. Moreover, persistent
activation of STAT3 is not limited to the tumor itself: it is
also transmitted to stromal inflammatory cells in the tumor
microenvironment. STAT3 signalling in innate immune
cells is required for the immunosuppressive and tumorpromoting effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
[12–14]. STAT3 also mediates regulatory T cell (Treg)
expansion in tumors and is necessary for the development
of Th17 cells[15], which can promote tumor growth.
Because STAT3 induces the expression of cytokines,
growth factors and angiogenic factors, and the associated
receptors in turn activate STAT3, a feedforward loop is
established between tumor cells and immune cells. As a
consequence, persistent activation of STAT3 mediates both
the propagation of tumor-promoting inflammation and
the suppression of anti-tumor immunity, thus forming a
promising target to improve cancer therapy by modulating
immune responses[16] .
Current attempts to target the JAK-STAT3
pathway include the use of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor
blocking antibodies[17], the use of specific STAT3
inhibitors[18–20] and JAK inhibitors[21]. AZD1480
is a potent, competitive small-molecule inhibitor of
JAK1/2 kinases, that is capable of blocking STAT3
phosphorylation and inhibiting tumor growth in a STAT3dependent manner[22]. In several different murine and
human tumor cell lines, including 786-O (renal cell
carcinoma), DU145 (prostate cancer), MDAH2774
(ovarian carcinoma), MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer),
Renca cells (renal carcinoma) and several human myeloma
cell lines, it has been shown that AZD1480 is able to
downregulate P-STAT3 expression in tumor cells resulting
in a delayed tumor growth in vivo[22–24]. However, none
of these studies looked at the direct effects of AZD1480
on the immune system. Therefore, in the present study we
investigated the effects of AZD1480 on the phenotype and
function of different immune cell populations present in
the tumor microenvironment, including T cells, dendritic
cells (DCs) and MDSCs, in a murine melanoma model
and on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from
melanoma patients. We show that, although AZD1480 has
the ability to delay tumor growth and prolong survival
of MO4-tumor bearing mice, the inhibition of JAK1/2
has detrimental effects on several aspects of the immune
system of these mice.

AZD1480 inhibits P-STAT3 expression but does
not induce apoptosis in murine melanoma cell
lines in vitro
Since it is well known that inhibition of STAT3
signalling can induce apoptosis in tumor cells[25] we
determined the apoptotic effects of AZD1480 in different
murine melanoma cell lines in vitro. The MO4 cell line,
which lacks constitutive expression of P-STAT3, was
treated with IL-6, in order to induce P-STAT3 expression
and the K1735-C4 cell line, characerized by constitutive
expression of P-STAT3, was treated with different
doses of AZD1480 for 48 hours. Even at the highest
concentration we tested (5 μM), AZD1480 failed to
induce apoptosis in all tested cell lines as evaluated by
Annexin-V/7-AAD staining (Figure 1A,B). However, a
dose-dependent downregulation of P-STAT3 expression
in MO4 melanoma cells was apparant 6 hours after the
treatment with AZD1480. At a concentration of 5 μM,
AZD1480 completely abrogated the P-STAT3 expression
in IL-6 treated MO4 cells (Figure 1C). Comparable effects
were seen in a human melanoma cell line (Supplementary
Figure 1) These data demonstrate that AZD1480 is able
to inhibit induced activation of P-STAT3 in the MO4 cell
line, without affecting the viability of these cells.

AZD1480 inhibits the growth of subcutaneously
implanted MO4 melanoma tumors and
prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice by
inhibiting P-STAT3 expression within the tumor
environment
We next wanted to investigate the in vivo antitumor effects of AZD1480 in a murine melanoma model.
MO4 cells were subcutaneously injected in the flank of
C57BL/6 mice and when tumors were palpable AZD1480
treatment was initiated. Mice were treated with AZD1480
at 30 mg/kg or with vehicle by oral gavage twice a day for
7 days. We observed a strong inhibition of tumor growth
in AZD1480-treated mice compared with the vehicletreated group (Figure 2A), as well as a prolonged survival
of AZD1480-treated mice compared to the vehicle
control group (median survival of 42 versus 30 days,
respectively; Figure 2B). Western blot analysis of whole
tumor lysates, obtained two hours after the last dosing
of AZD1480 or vehicle, showed a complete inhibition
of P-STAT3 expression by AZD1480 treatment (Figure
2C). These results indicate that AZD1480 has potent
antitumor effects in vivo in this melanoma model, which
is associated with inhibition of STAT3 signalling in the
tumor microenvironment.

In vivo AZD1480 treatment induces profound
changes in the immune cell composition in both
the spleen and the tumor microenvironment

compared to vehicle control treated mice (Figure 3A).
While we did not observe differences in the percentage
of dendritic cells (DCs), nor in the maturation status of
these cells (data not shown), we did observe a significant
decrease in the percentage of both monocytic MDSCs
(moMDSC; CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G-) and granulocytic
MDSCs (grMDSC; CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+; Figure 3B)
after treatment with AZD1480. In contrast, within the
tumor microenvironment, we observed a significant
decrease in the percentage of CD45+ cells (data not shown)
when mice were treated with AZD1480. Within the CD45+
cell population we evaluated the presence of T cells, DCs
and MDSCs. The percentage of both tumor-infiltrating

The tumor microenvironment is composed of a
complex network of immune cells, which can either inhibit
or promote tumor growth. Since we observed a significant
anti-tumor effect of AZD1480 we wondered whether
AZD1480 influences the immune cell composition in the
spleen and within the tumor microenvironment. In the
spleen of AZD1480 treated mice we observed a significant
increase in the percentages of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was dramatically decreased in
AZD1480 treated mice compared to vehicle treated
animals (Figure 3C). The number of tumor-infiltrating
DCs was also significantly decreased in AZD1480 treated
mice, while the maturation status of these DCs did not
differ between AZD1480 treated mice compared to vehicle
control treated mice (data not shown). Consistent with the
observations in the spleen, we also observed a decrease
in the percentage of both moMDSCs and grMDSCs
within the tumor microenvironment (Figure 3D) after
treatment with AZD1480. These data indicate that
AZD1480 treatment has different effects on the immune
cell composition of the peripheral lymphoid organs
compared to the tumor microenvironment. Thus, whereas
we observed an influx of T cells and a reduction of MDSC
numbers in the spleen of AZD1480 treated mice, in the
tumor the number of both tumor-infiltrating T cells and
tumor-infiltrating MDSCs is reduced. A similar reduction
was also observed for tumor-infiltrating DC numbers.

of CD4+ T cells. However, moMDSCs isolated from
AZD1480 treated mice still suppress the proliferation
of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells up to 80%, even at a 1:8
ratio (Figure 4D-E). Both the IFN-γ and the IL-2 secretion
were increased when splenocytes were co-cultured in the
presence of moMDSC derived from AZD1480 treated
mice compared to moMDSC isolated from vehicle treated
mice (Figure 4F). These data indicate that, on a per cell
basis, AZD1480 enhances the suppressive function of both
grMDSCs and moMDSCs on the proliferation of T cells.

AZD1480 and ruxolitinib do not affect
proliferation of T cells but negatively impact on
their IFN-γ secretion in vitro
Since we observed that AZD1480 enhanced the
suppressive function of MDSCs in vivo we wondered
whether AZD1480 had a direct effect on the proliferative
capacity and cytokine secretion of T cells in vitro. Even
at the highest concentration of AZD1480 (1.75 μM)
we tested, no statistically significant difference in the
proliferative capacity of either the CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells was observed compared to the positive control (cells
stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the absence
of AZD1480, 75 vs 63 % for the CD4+ T cells and 83
vs 66 % for the CD8+ T cells, respectively; Figure 5AB). In contrast, the IFN-γ secretion of splenocytes was
dramatically reduced after the addition of AZD1480,
even at the lowest concentration used (0.0125 μM),
compared to the control condition (Figure 5B). To rule
out the possibility that off-target effects of AZD1480
mediate the observed effects on T-cell proliferation and
IFN-γ secretion we performed the same experiments
with ruxolitinib, a more selective inhibitor of JAK1/2,
with a different off-target activity profile than AZD1480,
sunitinib, which inhibits signalling through different
receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor, stem cell factor receptor c-kit, flt3
and RET kinases and axitinib, a potent tyrosine kinase
receptor with increased selectivity for VEGFR 1-3 and
no known effect on JAK 1/2. Sunitinib treatment not only
led to a dramatic reduction in the secretion of IFN-γ but
also led to a dose-dependent reduction in the proliferative
capacity of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 5C). In
contrast, axitinib did not affect the proliferation of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells nor their capacity to secrete IFN-γ
(Figure 5D). As was observed for AZD1480, ruxolitinib
did not affect the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,
whereas a dramatic reduction in the secretion of IFN-γ
was observed (Figure 5E). Moreover, in accordance with
what we observed for AZD1480, in vitro treatment with
ruxolitinib did not induce apoptosis in MO4 melanoma
tumor cells but it did inhibit P-STAT3 expression in
these cells (Supplementary figure 2). These observations

In vivo AZD1480 treatment enhances the
suppressive function of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells
The observed reduction in the number of MDSCs in
both the spleen and the tumor microenvironment prompted
us to investigate whether AZD1480 affects the suppressive
activity of these cells. Therefore we co-cultured
splenocytes derived from healthy animals with grMDSC
or moMDSC sorted from spleens of AZD1480 treated
MO4 tumor-bearing mice and analyzed their effect on
the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.
At a 1:1 ratio (grMDSC:splenocytes) grMDSC isolated
from vehicle treated mice and AZD1480 treated mice
were equally suppressive, with a complete suppression
of proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. For
the grMDSCs isolated from vehicle treated mice we
observed a dose-dependent reduction in the suppressive
activity of these cells, with a complete abrogation of
the suppressive function of these cells when cultured at
a 1:8 (grMDSC:splenocytes) ratio. However, grMDSCs
isolated from AZD1480 treated mice still yielded a 50%
suppression of the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells when cultured at a 1:8 (grMDSC:splenocytes)
ratio (Figure 4A-B). In contrast, when we looked at
the cytokine secretion we observed an increase in the
IFN-γ secretion when we co-culture grMDSCs isolated
from the spleen of AZD1480 treated mice, compared to
grMDSCs isolated from vehicle treated mice (Figure 4C).
The secretion of IL-2 and TNF-α was not differentially
affected by vehicle or AZD1480 treatment (Figure 4C).
At a 1:2 ratio (moMDSC:splenocytes) moMDSC isolated
from vehicle treated mice almost completely lost their
suppressive activity on CD8+ T cell proliferation, while
they were still capable of suppressing the proliferation

indicate that the observed effects of AZD1480 on T-cell
proliferation and IFN-γ secretion are most likely mediated
by inhibition of JAK1/2 and are not due to off-target
effects of the drug.

(Figure 6A). The addition of AZD1480 to co-cultures
of human MDSCs and CD8+ T cells did not affect the
suppressive capacity of the MDSCs (Figure 6B). However,
AZD1480 dramatically reduces the IFN-γ secretion by
CD8+ T cells at very low concentrations and we observed
a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferative capacity of
CD8+ T cells treated with AZD1480 (Figure 7A-C). To
exclude possible off-target effects of AZD1480, CD8+ T
cells were treated with ruxolitinib. When used at the same
concentrations as AZD1480, ruxolitinib has the capacity
to reduce the proliferation of CD8+ T cells and to decrease
their ability to secrete IFN-γ (Figure 7D-F).

AZD1480 treatment does not affect the
suppressive capacity of human myeloid-derived
suppressor cells although it negatively impacts on
the proliferation and IFN-γ secretion of human
CD8+ T cells in vitro
Although initially most studies with MDSCs were
performed in mouse tumor models, there is evidence
that MDSCs are also present in cancer patients[26]. A
population of CD14+HLA-DRlow cells with suppressive
activity on T cells has been described for several tumor
types, including melanoma[27,28]. Here, we confirmed
that CD14+HLA-DRlow cells, isolated from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells obtained from melanoma
patients, have the ability to suppress the proliferation of
autologous CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner

DISCUSSION
We have shown that, although AZD1480 has the
ability to delay tumor growth and prolong survival of MO4
tumor-bearing mice, it has a significant impact on several
aspects of the immune system. The prolonged survival in
response to AZD1480 is quite mild and may be associated
with the detrimental effects on the immune system. Thus,
AZD1480 impairs the proliferative as well as the IFN-γ

secretion capacity of T cells while at the same time
enhancing the suppressive capacity of MDSCs. The same
effects were observed with ruxolitinib, a more specific
JAK1/2 inhibitor that has been approved by the FDA for
patients with intermediate- to high-risk myelofibrosis[29].
Moreover, sunitinib, which inhibits signalling through
different receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-

derived growth factor receptor, stem cell factor receptor
c-kit, flt3 and RET kinases, also reduced the capacity of
murine CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to secrete IFN-γ, while
axitinib, a potent tyrosine kinase receptor with increased
selectivity for VEGFR 1-3, and no known activity for
JAK1/2, did not influence the proliferation of T cells nor
their capacity to secrete IFN-γ. These results indicate that
the observed immunological effects are mediated by the

vitro treatment with AZD1480 did not induce apoptosis
in either mouse or human melanoma cell lines. One
possibility for this discrepancy is that JAK/STAT signaling
is not required for cell survival in cell culture in which the
cells are exposed to an excess of growth factors present in
the serum. In the in vivo situation, the complexity of the
tumor environment could provide a context in which JAK/
STAT activity is essential for survival. Although it has been
shown that AZD1480 suppresses P-STAT3 expression
both in the tumor cells as well as in the different types of
cells present in the tumor microenvironment, the relative
contribution of the different cell types to the observed in
vivo effects is not clear at this moment.
STAT3 is probably one of the most important
transcription factors that regulate MDSC expansion
and function. It has been shown that ablation of STAT3
expression markedly reduced the expansion of MDSCs
and promoted the accumulation of DCs in tumor-bearing
mice[12,13]. We indeed show that treatment of MO4
tumor-bearing mice with AZD1480 leads to a reduction
in the number of MDSCs both in the spleen and in the
tumor microenvironment. However, we did not observe
differences in the number of DCs nor in the maturation
status of these DCs. This is in line with observations
made by Heine et al. who showed that the JAK-inhibitor
ruxolitinib affects DC differentiation, phenotype and
function leading to impaired T-cell activation[44]. This
explains the use of this inhibitor for the treatment of
autoimmune diseases[45,46]. Hipp et al. showed that
sorafenib, but not sunitinib, inhibits the function of DCs
and the induction of primary immune responses[47].
Moreover, we showed that although treatment with
AZD1480 leads to a reduction in the number of MDSCs,
the suppressive activity of these MDSCs is enhanced
compared to the MDSCs obtained from vehicle treated
mice. Indicating that STAT3 does play an important role in
the accumulation of these MDSCs while the role of STAT3
in the function of these cells still remains unclear. In tumorbearing mice two functionally distinct subtypes of MDSCs
have been identified: CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow MDSCs
which are morphologically similar to polymorphonuclear
granulocytes (grMDSCs) and CD11b+Ly6G-Ly6Chigh
MDSCs which have a monocytic phenotype (moMDSCs).
We have previously shown that grMDSCs possess a
stronger suppressive activity compared to moMDSCs.
Moreover, both grMDSCs and moMDSCs isolated from
within the tumor microenvironment have a much stronger
suppressive activity compared to MDSCs isolated from
the spleen of tumor-bearing mice, associated with a higher
NO2- production by the tumor-derived moMDSCs and a
higher arginase activity for both subsets[48]. Since it has
been shown that the expression of P-STAT3 regulates
arginase 1 expression levels and activity in MDSCs[49],
and since we observed a higher activity of arginase 1 in
tumor-derived MDSCs, we cannot exclude that AZD1480
has differential effects on the function of either tumor-or

inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway.
JAK 1 and 2 are ubiquitously expressed in mammals
where they are involved in cell growth, survival,
development and differentiation of immune cells[30,31].
Complete loss of function of either JAK1 or JAK2 is lethal
in mice and has not been described in humans[32,33].
However, activating mutations of JAKs are found in
association with malignant transformations, the most
common being the gain-of-function V617F mutation of
JAK2 in polycythemia vera and other myeloproliferative
disorders[34]. In solid cancers JAK gene mutations are
rare events[35,36]. Despite this, we show that the JAK1/2
inhibitor, AZD1480, is able to inhibit tumor growth and
prolong survival in a murine melanoma model. This is in
line with observations of Hedvat et al. who showed that
AZD1480 was able to suppress the growth of solid tumor
xenograft cell lines that displayed constitutive STAT3
activation[22]. However, Hedvat et al. performed their
experiments in athymic nude mice so they were unable
to evaluate the role of the immune system in the observed
tumor regression.
Further research is needed to fully unravel the
mechanism used by AZD1480 to delay tumor growth
while at the same time inhibiting T-cell effector functions.
Interestingly, similar effects have been described for
mTOR inhibitors, the so-called rapalogs. Thus, it has
been shown for different rapalogs, including rapamycin,
that in addition to their potent immunosuppressive
function, they can also act as cancer-preventive agents.
Both actions are mediated through specific inhibition of
the mTOR signaling pathway. It has been shown that the
mTOR pathway plays an important role in the regulation
of the cell cycle in response to changes in nutrient levels
[37,38]. Moreover, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in
different types of cancer and involves a number of tumor
suppressor genes including PTEN, LKB1, TSC1, TSC2,
Rb1 and p53, making this pathway a promising target for
anti-cancer therapies[39–41]. Rapamycin inhibits tumor
growth by affecting tumor cell proliferation, inducing
apoptosis and by suppressing angiogenesis. However the
same mechanisms are used to inhibit the proliferation
of B and T cells, resulting in immunosuppression. The
available evidence indicates that the anti-cancer activities
may be dominant over the immunosuppressive effects.
The same could be true for AZD1480, and other JAK
inhibitors. It has for example been shown that AZD1480
has anti-angiogenic effects by itself[23] and that AZD1480
improves the effect of cediranib, a potent VEGFR
kinase inhibitor, in tumors refractory to anti-VEGFR
treatment[42]. It is possible that inhibition of the JAK/
STAT pathway could indirectly influence the activation of
mTOR, thereby suppressing tumor growth[43]. However
further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and
to elucidate the exact working mechanisms of AZD1480.
Despite the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, in

spleen-derived MDSCs. In favor of this hypothesis are the
results of Ko et al., who showed that sunitinib not only
has divergent effects on the subpopulations of MDSCs but
also differentially impacts on the suppressive function of
spleen-and tumor-derived MDSCs[50]. However, given
the difficulty to obtain MDSCs from a solid tumor we
were not able to test the differential effects of AZD1480
on subsets of spleen-and tumor-derived MDSCs.
In contrast to the murine data, addition of AZD1480
to co-cultures of MDSCs and T cells obtained from
melanoma patients did not affect the suppressive activity
of MDSCs. The difference between the murine and human
data could be explained by the fact that mice were treated
in vivo, while in the human scenario the drug was added
in vitro. This could indicate that AZD1480 does not have
a direct effect on the MDSCs but that this drug affects
the tumor microenvironment leading to alterations in the
cytokine secretion.
Both the murine and human T-cell function is
affected by the addition of either AZD1480 or ruxolitinib
to in vitro cultures. This is in line with observations made
by Liu et al. who showed that in vivo treatment with
AZD1480 leads to a reduced proliferation and cytokine
secretion of T cells in a mouse model of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis[51]. In contrast, Heine
et al., showed that ruxolitinib predominantly works on
the function of DCs and not on T cells[44]. However,
differences between in vitro and in vivo treatment could
explain these contradictory results. In a recent paper,
Miller et al. show that increased JAK2 expression in
primary breast tumors is associated with increased
intratumoral lymphocyte infiltration, as well as improved
clinical outcome. Moreover, they confirmed our finding
that ruxolitinib dramatically inhibits IFN-γ production by
T cells in vitro[52].
Taken together, caution should be taken when
treating cancer patients with JAK-STAT inhibitors,
especially when combining them with immunotherapy,
since systemic targeting of the JAK-STAT pathway can
have divergent effects on tumor growth and anti-tumor
immune responses.
Currently, novel inhibitors with a higher selectivity
for either JAK1 or JAK2 are being developed[53]. Future
immunological studies should address whether the
immunosuppressive effects are also observed with these
selective inhibitors, especially when considering their use
for the treatment of cancer patients in combination with
active immunotherapy.

Tumor Cell lines
The mouse melanoma cell line MO4 (kindly
provided by K. Rock, University of Massachusetts
Medical center) was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented
with 5% fetal clone I (FCI), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. For some
experiments MO4 cells were treated with IL-6 (50 ng/ml,
Gentaur) in order to upregulate P-STAT3 expression. The
K1735-C4 melanoma cell line (kindly provided by I.J.
Fidler, University of Texas) is maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The
human melanoma cell line 1087-mel (provided by S.L.
Topalian, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center,
Johns Hopkins University) was cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1
mM sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. No
full authentication of the cell lines was carried out. Cell
lines were tested for their known characteristics including
expression of antigens and MHC molecules by reverse
transcriptase PCR or flow cytometry. Their in vitro and in
vivo growth characteristics were closely monitored.

Mice and tumor model
Female, 6- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from Charles River (L’Arbresle, France).
Animals were treated according to the European
guidelines for animal experimentation. All experiments
were reviewed and approved by the ethical committee for
use of laboratory animals of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
For the induction of tumor growth, mice were anesthetized
by inhalation of isoflurane and inoculated with 5 x 105
MO4 tumor cells administered by subcutaneous injection
in the lower back.

Preparation of AZD1480, sunitinib, axitinib and
ruxolitinib
AZD1480 was kindly provided by Dr. Dennis
Huszar from Astrazeneca. Ruxolitinib, axitinib and
sunitinib were obtained from Selleckchem. For in vitro
experiments all drugs were dissolved in 100% DMSO at a
final stock concentration of 10 mM and stored, in singleuse vials, at -20°C. For in vivo experiments AZD1480
was formulated in sterile water supplemented with 0.5%

using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins (10 μg)
were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A monoclonal
mouse antibody against P-STAT3 was used as primary
antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was used
for detection. An HRP-conjugated β-actin antibody was
used for normalization of the signal. All antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling. Antibody binding was
visualized with enhanced chemoluminescence (Pierce).

Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with AZD1480
Ten days after the inoculation of MO4 tumor cells,
when tumors reached a diameter of approximately 100
mm3, mice were randomly divided into a control group
and a treatment group (5 mice/group) which were dosed
orally with vehicle or AZD1480 (30 mg/kg), respectively.
Mice were treated by oral gavage twice a day (bid) for
a period of 7 days. At this dose of AZD1480 no lethal
toxicity was observed. Tumors were measured every
2 days and tumor volume was calculated based on the
following formula: 0.5 x ((smallest diameter)2 x (largest
diameter)). When tumors reached a volume of 2500 mm3
mice were sacrificied.

Phenotypical characterization of immune cells
In order to evaluate the phenotype of different
immune cell populations, cells derived from the spleen or
tumor of vehicle- or AZD1480-treated mice were stained
with the following antibodies: phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (BioLegend), Alexa Fluor 700
(AF700)-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (BD Biosciences),
AF647-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 (BioLegend), Horizon
V450-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (BD Biosciences),
peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-Cy5.5-conjugated
anti-mouse CD4 (BD Biosciences), PE-conjugated antimouse CD25 (eBioscience), AF700-conjugated antimouse CD127 (eBioscience), AF647-conjugated antimouse CD11c (BioLegend), PE-conjugated anti-mouse
CD11b (BD Biosciences), fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD86 (BD Biosciences),
allophycocyanin (APC)-H7-conjugated anti-mouse CD80
(BD Biosciences), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b
(BD Biosciences), AF647-conjugated anti-mouse Ly6G
(BioLegend) and PECy7-conjugated anti-mouse Ly6C
(BioLegend).

In vitro apoptosis assay
MO4, K1735-C4 and 1087-mel cells were seeded in
6-well plates (0.5 x106 cells/well) overnight to allow cell
adhesion. Cells were subsequently treated with different
concentrations of AZD1480 (0.5 μM, 1 μM, 5 μM and 10
μM) and 48 hours later, the percentage of apoptotic cells
was determined by staining with Annexin-V Alexa Fluor
647 (AF647, BioLegend) and 7-AAD (BD Biosciences).

Preparation of a single cell suspension from spleen
and tumor of tumor-bearing mice
For some experiments tumor-bearing mice were
sacrificed 2 hours after the last treatment with AZD1480 or
vehicle and spleens and tumors were isolated. Single-cell
suspensions prepared from splenocytes were treated with
Tris-buffered ammonium chloride for 5 min to remove
red blood cells. Single-cell suspensions from tumor tissue
were prepared using the GentleMACS single cell isolation
protocol (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, tumors were isolated
and minced into small pieces followed by a mechanical
dissociation step using the GentleMACS dissociator.
Samples were then incubated for 40 min at 37°C with
the following enzymes: collagenase I (10,000 U/ml) and
dispase II (32 mg/ml). After a last mechanical disruption
step, the digested tumors were harvested, filtered (over a
70 μM nylon filter, BD Falcon) and red blood cells were
lysed by adding Tris-buffered ammonium chloride.

Purification of MDSCs from spleen
Different subsets of MDSCs were purified from the
spleen of tumor-bearing mice as described before[48] .
Briefly, the CD11b+ cell fraction was enriched by MACS
sorting using CD11b MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These
enriched CD11b+ cells were then stained with FITCconjugated anti-mouse CD11b, APC-conjugated antimouse Ly6G and PECy7-conjugated anti-mouse Ly6C
antibodies. Subsets of MDSCs were sorted to a purity
of > 90% using a BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD
Biosciences).

System; Caridian BCT) using a previously described
technique[54]. Fractions 2 and 3 were used as a source
for T cells, whereas fraction 5, containing monocytes,
was used for the isolation of MDSCs. First, the CD14+
cell fraction was enriched by MACS sorting using
CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. These enriched CD14+ cells
were then stained with APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-human
CD14 (BioLegend) and a PE-conjugated anti-human
HLA-DR (BD Biosciences). CD14+HLA-DRhigh cells
(considered to be monocytes) and the CD14+HLA-DRlow
cells (defined as MDSCs) were sorted to a purity of > 90%
using a BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
Lymphocytes were purified from fractions 2 and 3 of the
elutriation product and were used as a source of T cells.
CD8+ Teff cells and naïve CD4+ T cells were sorted on LS
columns using MACS CD8+ or CD4+ magnetic beads,

μM). Proliferation of CD8+ T cells was analyzed by flow
cytometry as described before.

Suppression assay

Statistical analysis

The suppressive activity of MDSCs was determined
using standard proliferation assays as described
before[47]. In brief, freshly isolated splenocytes, obtained
from healthy mice, were labelled with 0.5 μM CellTraceTM
Violet (Invitrogen) and seeded in 96-well plates at 2 x 105
cells/well. Purified MDSCs were then added at different
ratios, ranging from 1:1 to 1:8 (MDSC:splenocytes).
T-cell proliferation was induced by anti-CD3/CD28 beads
(Invitrogen) in the presence of IL-2 (100 U/ml, Chiron).
After 3 days, proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was
analyzed by flow cytometry by staining with PerCPCy5.5conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (BioLegend), AF700conjugated anti-mouse CD4 and APC-H7-conjugated antimouse CD8 (BD Biosciences) antibodies. The percentage
of T-cell suppression was calculated using the following
formula:

Results are presented as mean SEM. For the
comparison of two groups, unpaired Student’s t-test was
carried out. Sample size and number of repetitions for each
experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Survival
was visualized in a Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed by
the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 5.

In order to analyze the suppressive function of
human MDSCs, allogeneic purified CD8+ T cells were
labelled with 0.5 μM CellTraceTM Violet (Invitrogen) and
seeded in 96-well plates at 2 x 105 cells/well. Purified
CD14+HLA-DRhigh monocytes and CD14+HLA-DRlow
MDSCs were added at different ratios, ranging from 1:1
to 1:8 (MDSC:T cells). After 6 days, proliferation of CD8+
T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry by staining with
APC-conjugated anti-human CD3 and FITC-conjugated
anti-human CD8.
To determine the direct effects of AZD1480 and
ruxolitinib on the proliferation of both murine and human
T cells, 2 x 105 CellTraceTM Violet labelled T cells were
seeded in 96-well plates and different concentrations of
AZD1480 or ruxolitinib were added (ranging from 0-1.75
