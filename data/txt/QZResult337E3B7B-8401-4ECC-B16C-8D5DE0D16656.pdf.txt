Abstract
We have shown that neu transgenic mice are immunotolerant
and that immunizations with dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with
neu-derived antigens were not able to control tumor growth in
these animals. We tested whether, by modulating the tumor
microenvironment with Toll-like receptor ligands, it could be
possible to induce the activation of antitumor responses in
neu mice. Our results indicate that only intratumoral (i.t.)
injections of CpG-ODN induce an antitumor response in neu
mice. To target the CpG-ODN to the tumor site anywhere
within the body, we chemically conjugated an anti–Her-2/neu
monoclonal antibody (mAb) with CpG-ODN. The anti–neuCpG hybrid molecule retained its ability to bind to Her-2/neu+
tumors, activate DCs, and induce antitumor responses. Our
results indicated that injections of anti–neu-CpG induced the
rejection of primary tumors in 100% of BALB/c mice and only
in f30% of BALB-neuT mice. After challenging the BALB/c
and BALB-neuT mice, we observed that BALB/c mice
developed a protective memory response; in contrast, BALBneuT mice succumbed to the challenge. After injections of
anti–neu-CpG, T regulatory cells (T-reg) were drastically
reduced at the tumor site, but a large number were still
present in the lymphoid organs. When BALB-neuT mice were
treated with anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR mAb, but not with
anti-CD25 mAb, 100% of the BALB-neuT mice rejected the
primary tumor and developed a protective memory response
indicating the critical role of T-regs in regulating the
repertoire against self antigens. Taken together, these results
indicate that CpG-ODN–targeted therapy and depletion of
T-regs optimally activate a primary response and generate a
protective memory response against self-tumor antigens.

exclusively in microbial pathogens termed pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMP; ref. 1). Recent studies have shown that
recognition of PAMPs by antigen-presenting cells (APC) is
mediated by a Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (2, 3). There are
currently >10 known TLR family members capable of sensing
bacterial wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; TLR2/TLR-4), CpG-DNA (TLR-9), flagellin (TLR-5), as well as other
microbial products (4). The signaling provided by TLRs triggers
maturation and activation of APCs (5, 6), increasing their ability to
prime naive T cells. In this way, TLRs link the recognition of
pathogens with induction of adaptive responses. It has been shown
that targeting APCs with different TLR adjuvants could enhance or
induce the activation of antitumor responses (7–9). We have shown
that FVB-Her-2/neu transgenic mice (10–13) or the BALB-neuT
mice (14) are tolerant to neu-dominant epitopes and that these
animals only have a low avidity repertoire to neu antigens (10–13).
Our data also indicate that multiple immunizations with dendritic
cells (DC) pulsed with neu peptides delay the tumor growth but are
not effective at controlling tumor growth (10–13). We have recently
shown that i.t. injections of CpG-ODN is the most effective strategy
to delay tumor growth in young and old mice (15). The major
drawback of i.t. injections of CpG-ODN is that not all tumors are
physically accessible. To target the CpG-ODN to the tumor
anywhere in the body, we produced a hybrid-molecule between
an antibody directed against the neu molecule and CpG-ODN
(anti–neu-CpG). Our results showed that the anti–neu-CpG
retained its dual capacity of (a) binding to Her-2/neu+ tumor cells
and (b) activating DCs. Treatment with anti–neu-CpG induced
tumor rejection in 100 of BALB/c mice, and only f30% of BALBneuT rejected the tumor. Interestingly, BALB/c mice were able to
develop a memory response; in contrast, BALB-neuT mice that
rejected the first tumor succumbed to the tumor challenge. These
results raise an important issue: Can tolerant hosts (BALB-neuT
mice) develop memory responses? If yes, how is the generation of
memory responses against self-antigens or tumors controlled in
tolerant hosts?
There is accumulating evidence indicating that immunologic
tolerance is maintained, not only by clonal deletion but also by
T regulatory cells (T-reg; refs. 16–19). Depletion of CD4+CD25+
T cells by the administration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody
(mAb) has been shown to suppress the growth of a variety of
different syngeneic tumors in mice (20–22). The observation that
the removal of immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells can abrogate
unresponsiveness to syngeneic tumors in vivo, leading to the
spontaneous development of tumor-specific responses, indicates
that the maintenance of self-tolerance against tumor-self antigens

Regulation of Antitumor Responses in Tolerant Hosts

could potentially be lifted (22, 23). When BALB-neuT mice were
treated with anti-CD25 or anti-GITR alone, no antitumor effect was
observed. However, the combination of injections of anti–neu-CpG
plus anti-GITR, but not anti-CD25, induced both a complete
rejection of the tumors and a protective memory response in these
animals. Taken together, these results have important implications
for the development of immunization protocols against self-tumor
antigens which are discussed.

Materials and Methods
Mice, cell lines, and reagents. Female BALB/c and female BALB/c
athymic mice were purchased from Harlan. BALB-neuT mice were
generated as previously described (24) and bred in our facilities. Female
BALB-neuT mice of 6 to 8 wk old were used before autochthonous tumor
appearance. TUBO is a cell line generated from a spontaneous mammary
gland tumor from a BALB-neuT mouse (25). The BM-185 wild-type (wt) and
BM-185 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; BM-185EGFP) cell lines (26) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Kohn at the University
of Southern California, Los Angeles. The parental 66.3 cell line (H-2d )
derived from a mouse breast tumor and its transfectant, the A2L2,
expressing the rat HER-2/neu (27) were provided by Dr. J.E. Price (M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center). The mouse renal cell carcinoma RENCA cells of
BALB/c origin were used as a negative control for the cytotoxic assays. AntiGITR (DTA-1) was obtained from Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi (Kyoto University).
Anti-CD25 (PC61) was obtained from Dr. Linda Bradley (Sidney Kimmel
Cancer Center). Anti-neu (7.16.4, a mouse IgG2a antibody which recognizes
the rat Her-2/neu) was obtained from Dr. Mark Greene (University
of Pennsylvania). All cell lines were maintained in complete RPMI
medium (RPMI 1640) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamine,
5  10-5 mol/L 2-mercapethanol, and 50 Ag/mL gentamicin. TLR ligands,
1826-CpG-ODN and 1982-control-ODN, were purchased from Oligo Etc,
Imiquimod from 3M Pharmaceuticals, Poly-I:C and LPS from Sigma-Aldrich.
Flagellin was purified as previously reported (28).
Construction of anti–neu-CpG. 5¶-Amino–modified CpG-ODN was
subsequently modified to incorporate a 4FB-moiety by treatment with
S-4FB (Solulink Biosciences). Anti-neu antibody was modified to incorporate HyNic moieties on lysine residues using S-HyNic (Solulink Biosciences).
Synthesis of the conjugate was accomplished by mixing the 4FB-modified
CpG oligo with the HyNic-modified anti-neu antibody followed by
purification by size exclusion chromatography x(Superdex 200, GE HealthCare). Purity of the conjugated antibody was confirmed by running the
sample in an SDS-PAGE gel.
In vivo tumor studies. TUBO cells (1  106) were implanted s.c. in
BALB/c, BALB-neuT, and BALB/c athymic mice. Tumors were allowed to
grow for 10 d before treatment was initiated. On day 10 after tumor
challenge (tumor size, f150–200 mm3), animals were randomly divided
into groups of five to eight mice per group. Animals received i.t. or i.v.
injections of anti–neu-CpG (50 Ag/injection) twice a week for 3 wk. Control
groups are described in the text. Groups of animals were also injected with
anti-GITR. For the evaluation of memory responses, animals were
challenged 70 d after the first tumor challenge with a second dose of 106
TUBO cells. Tumor growth was monitored every 2 to 3 d.
Depletion studies. Anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (56-6.37) mAbs were
used for in vivo depletion of T-cell subsets. Anti-asialo GM1 (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries) was used to deplete natural killer (NK) cells. Animals
were injected i.p. with 300 Ag of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAb or 50 Ag of
anti-asialo GM1 twice per week, starting 1 wk before inoculation of the
tumor cells and continuing for the duration of the experiment. To deplete
T-regs, animals were injected with anti-CD25 or anti-GITR starting on day 9,
16, and 23 (300 Ag/injection) after tumor challenge.
Analysis of CD4+ Foxp3+ T-regs. The number of T-regs in the tumor
microenvironment, spleen, and lymph nodes (LN) in BALB-neuT with or
without TUBO tumors and after treatment with anti–neu-CpG was
determined by the analysis of CD4+Foxp3+ cells using a commercially
available kit (eBioscience) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Generation of CTL bulk cultures and cytotoxic activity. BALB-neuT
tumor-bearing mice were injected i.t. thrice a week with anti–neu-CpG
(50 Ag/injection) for 2 wk. Groups of animals were also injected with antiGITR on days 9 and 16 (300 Ag/injection) after tumor challenge. One week
after the last injection with anti–neu-CpG, animals were sacrificed. Spleen
cells (6  106) from primed animals were restimulated in vitro with 5  105
irradiated (3,000 rads) TUBO cells plus 1  106 irradiated BALB/c spleen
cells as feeders. After 5 d, cultures were assayed for lytic activity in a 51Cr
release assay against TUBO, 66.3, A2L2, and RENCA cells. Supernatants were
recovered after 6 h of incubation at 37jC, and the percentage of lysis was
determined by the formula: percent specific lysis = 100 (experimental
release
spontaneous release) / (maximum release
spontaneous
release).
Statistical analyses. Statistical significance of data was determined by
Student’s t test to evaluate the P value. The relationship between two
variables was tested using regression analysis, and P < 0.05 was considered
significant. Survival analysis used the Breslow modification of the KaplanMeier test.

Results
Development of anti–neu-CpG–conjugated molecules to
target CpG-ODN at the tumor site. We have previously shown
that, among different TLR ligands, only i.t. injections of CpG-ODN
induce an antitumor response in neu-tolerant mice (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 15). Although i.t. injections of CpG-ODN could
significantly prolong the survival of BALB-neuT mice (Supplementary Fig. S1), the major drawback of this approach is that not all
tumors will be physically accessible for i.t. injections. Therefore, the
generation of a targeted CpG-ODN would be more practical. To
target the CpG-ODN anywhere in the body, we produced a hybrid
molecule between an antibody directed against the rat neu
molecule and CpG-ODN (Fig. 1A). The CpG-ODN was conjugated
to the anti-neu mAb (7.16.4) by introducing a cleavable linker
using the disulfide bioconjugation system, as described in the
Materials and Methods and as shown in Fig. 1B. Next, we tested
the functionality of the anti–neu-CpG. TUBO cells were stained
with decreasing concentrations of anti-neu and anti–neu-CpG
(1, 0.1, and 0.01 Ag). As shown in Fig. 2A, the anti–neu-CpG binds
with the same intensity to TUBO cells, as does the anti-neu
mAb. These results indicate that anti–neu-CpG retains its affinity/
avidity for the neu antigen present on tumor cells and the ability
to bind and recognize Her-2/neu+ cells in the same fashion as the
anti-neu mAb. We also evaluate the stimulatory capability of
the anti–neu-CpG. DCs were stimulated in the presence of CpGODN, anti–neu-CpG, control-ODN, or anti-neu mAb overnight
and analyzed for the expression of activation cellular markers
and secreted cytokines. The anti–neu-CpG induced the activation
of DCs by increasing the levels of expression of class I and
B7.1 molecules with the same efficiency as CpG-ODN, whereas
stimulation with control-ODN or anti-neu mAb showed no
stimulatory effect (Fig. 2B). DCs treated with anti–neu-CpG
produced similar amounts of interleukin 12 (IL-12), as did DCs
treated with CpG-ODN (Fig. 2C). However, no production of
IL-12 was detected after treatment with control-ODN or antineu mAb. These results show that the anti–neu-CpG retained its
dual capacity of (a) binding to Her-2/neu+ tumor cells and (b)
activating DCs.
Antitumor effect of anti–neu-CpG. Having shown that anti–
neu-CpG is a functional molecule, we first tested whether this
hybrid molecule is capable of activating an antitumor response. For
the first set of experiments, TUBO tumor-bearing BALB-neuT mice
were injected i.t. with anti–neu-CpG generated with a cleavable or

noncleavable linker. As controls we included (a) TUBO tumorbearing BALB/c mice injected i.t. with anti–neu-CpG (cleavable
linker) and (b) TUBO tumor-bearing BALB-neuT mice injected
i.t. with CpG-ODN. Our results indicate that 100% of BALB/c
mice injected i.t. with anti–neu-CpG rejected the tumor (Fig. 3A).
BALB-neuT mice injected i.t. with anti–neu-CpG or CpG-ODN,
two of five animals rejected the tumors, and those animals that
did not reject the tumor significantly delay the tumor growth
compared with control animals (Fig. 3A). Animals treated with
anti–neu-CpG noncleavable linker did not have an antitumor
effect (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the inclusion of a
cleavable linker is critical in this hybrid molecule to release the
CpG-ODN at the tumor site to stimulate an immune response.
Additionally, we included TUBO tumor-bearing BALB-neuT mice
injected i.t. with CpG-ODN plus anti-neu or anti-neu mAb alone.
Animals treated with CpG-ODN plus anti-neu has the same effect
as animals treated with CpG-ODN alone, and no antitumor effect
was observed after treatment with anti-neu mAb alone (Supple-

mentary Fig. S2). These results indicate that anti–neu-CpG with a
cleavable linker is a functional molecule able to induce an antitumor immune response. The antitumor effect of anti–neu-CpG is
due to the activation of an immune response and not through
direct inhibition of TUBO cells by the anti–neu-CpG or anti-neu
mAb (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To confirm whether tumor rejection was mediated by T cells and
NK cells and to evaluate the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets,
BALB-neuT mice were depleted of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and
NK cells with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and anti-asialoGM1 antibodies
(anti-NK antibody), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, depletion of
CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells abrogates the antitumor
response. These results indicate that, for the rejection of the tumor,
the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells is necessary
after anti–neu-CpG injections. Intratumoral injections of anti–neuCpG in BALB/c athymic mice delayed tumor growth when
compared with control animals (Fig. 3C). This indicates that there
is activation of an immune response which is most probably

Figure 2. Functional analysis of
anti–neu-CpG. A, binding of
anti–neu-CpG-ODN to TUBO cells.
Decreasing concentrations of anti-neu and
anti–neu-CpG were used to stain TUBO
cells: 1 Ag (thick line ), 0.1 Ag (broken line ),
and 0.01 Ag (dash line ). B, CpG-ODN
and anti–neu-CpG-ODN induce the
expression of activator markers on DCs.
DCs were incubated in the presence of
0.5 Ag of control antibody (solid line ),
control-ODN (dash line ), anti-neu (dotted

anti–neu-CpG (thick broken line ) overnight.
On the next day, DCs were recovered
and analyzed for the up-regulation of
classes I and B7.1. C, anti–neu-CpG
induced the secretion of cytokines. DCs
(106) were stimulated with CpG-ODN,
anti–neu-CpG-ODN, ODN-control,
anti-neu, or not stimulated (Control ). After
48 h, supernatants were collected and
analyzed for the presence of IL-12.
Samples were run in triplicates. Data are

mediated by NK cells. However, activation of NK cells alone is not
sufficient to mediate complete tumor rejection. Additionally, these
results indicate that the antitumor response is not exclusively
through the activation of APCs but also depends on the activation
of a cellular response.
Analysis of immune tumor responses after anti–neu-CpG
injections. We evaluated whether BALB/c and BALB-neuT mice
that rejected the tumor after the injections with anti–neu-CpG
would induce a protective memory response. BALB/c and BALBneuT mice that rejected the first tumor were challenged with TUBO
cells 70 days later. BALB/c mice were able to reject the tumor
challenge; in contrast, BALB-neuT mice did not (Fig. 4A), indicating
that protective memory responses were not generated in tolerant
mice. We asked whether tolerant and nontolerant animals differ in
the generation of memory responses. For these experiments, we
use the BM-185-EGFP. The BM-185-EGFP cells are antigenic and
rejected by BALB/c mice (29). Furthermore, after injection of
BM-185-EGFP, BALB/c mice generate long-term memory responses
against the BM-185 wt cells. After implanting the BM-185-EGFP
cells in the animals, both BALB/c and BALB-neuT rejected the BM185-EGFP cells, and after a tumor challenge with BM-185 wt cells,
these cells were rejected (Fig. 4B). As a control, BM-185 wt cells
were implanted into the BALB/c and BALB-neuT mice, and as
expected, these cells formed tumors in these animals. These results
indicate that primary and memory immune responses against

www.aacrjournals.org

nominal antigens could be developed in neu-tolerant hosts with the
same efficiency as in nontolerant hosts.
There is extensive evidence indicating that T-regs can suppress
primary and memory immune responses and self reactive T cells
(30, 31). We analyzed the levels of T-regs in BALB-neuT mice with
or without TUBO tumors and treated with anti–neu-CpG. Our data
indicated that T-regs kept accumulating over time within the
tumor microenvironment (Fig. 4C). Next, we evaluated whether
there were changes in the number of T-regs in BALB-neuT mice
after i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG. In tumor-bearing mice, the
number of CD4+Foxp3+ cells increase both in spleen ( from 4.7% to
6.7%) and LN ( from 5.8% to 7.9%) when compared with animals
without tumors (Fig. 4D). After anti–neu-CpG treatment, there was
a f80% to 85% reduction in the number of CD4+Foxp3+ cells
within the tumor and a f15% reduction in spleen and LN
(Fig. 4D).
Anti–neu-CpG injections and T-reg depletion induces a
protective memory response in BALB-neuT mice. Although the
levels of T-regs within the tumor were drastically reduced after i.t.
injections of anti–neu-CpG, there were still large numbers of Tregs in spleen and LN that could influence the activation of
primary and memory responses in BALB-neuT mice. We tested
the effect of depleting T-regs with anti-CD25 or anti-GITR
alone or in combination with anti–neu-CpG to induce the
elimination of the transplantable TUBO tumor in BALB-neuT

Figure 3. Antitumor effect of anti–neu-CpG. A, BALB-neuT and BALB/c mice were implanted with 106 TUBO cells on day 0. On day 10, animals were treated with
i.t. injections of CpG-ODN (as a positive control) or anti–neu-CpG containing a cleavable or noncleavable linker. Animals were treated twice a week (50 Ag/injection) for
3 wk. Control groups were treated with i.t. injections of PBS. Five animals were included per group. Tumors were measured every 5 d with caliper in two dimensions.
Individual tumor growth of animals treated with CpG-ODN or anti–neu-CpG is shown. Data of control group are means of five animals F SE. Data are representative
of one of two experiments. B, to evaluate the subset of immune cells that contributed to the antitumor responses, BALB-neuT mice were treated with anti-CD4,
anti-CD8, and anti-NK starting 1 wk before tumor implantation and throughout the experiment. Animals were s.c. implanted with 106 TUBO cells on day 0. On day 10,
animals were injected i.t. with anti–neu-CpG, as described above. Animals were monitored for the development of tumors and survival. Six animals were included
per group. Survival percentages were determined. C, BALB/c athymic mice were implanted with 106 TUBO cells on day 0. On day 10, animals were not treated or treated
with i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG, as described above. Six animals were included per group. Tumors were measured every 5 d with caliper in two dimensions.

mice. Considering the use of anti-GITR is controversial for the
depletion of T-regs, because some reports show that anti-GITR
deplete T-regs (32) whereas in other reports it stimulates CD8
T cells (33). The GITR signaling in T cells is similar to the signal
provided by other TNFR (e.g., OX40; ref. 34). We have shown
that anti-OX40 mAb could enhance the immune responses in
neu mice (10, 12), and on the other hand, it has been shown that
anti-OX40 could inhibit T-regs (35). As a control we included
anti-OX40 mAb. The combination of anti–neu-CpG plus antiGITR induced the rejection of the TUBO tumor in 100% of the
BALB-neuT mice (Fig. 5A). Treatment with anti–neu-CpG plus
anti-OX40 is better than anti–neu-CpG alone, and animals
significantly delay the tumor growth when compared with the
control group (Fig. 5A). Fifty percent of the BALB-neuT mice
treated with anti–neu-CpG plus anti-OX40 rejected the tumor,
whereas only 35% of the animals treated with anti–neu-CpG alone
rejected the tumor (Fig. 5A). BALB-neuT mice treated with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

anti–neu-CpG plus anti-CD25 did not reject the tumor, and they
succumbed earlier to the tumor when compared with animals
treated with anti–neu-CpG alone (Fig. 5A). Treatment with antiCD25, anti-GITR, or anti-OX40 alone had no antitumor effect
(Fig. 5A). Next, animals that rejected the tumor were challenged
with TUBO cells 70 days after injection of the first tumor. Only
animals treated with anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR developed a
memory response, and all mice remained tumor-free (Fig. 5B). No
memory responses were observed in animals treated with anti–
neu-CpG alone or anti–neu-CpG plus anti-OX40 (Fig. 5B).
We also analyzed the effect of anti–neu-CpG and anti-GITR in
priming a cytotoxic T-cell response. BALB-neuT tumor-bearing
mice were treated with i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG in the
presence or absence of anti-GITR. As expected, stronger CTL
responses were developed in animals treated with anti-GITR mAb
(Fig. 5C). CTLs killed TUBO, A2L2, and, to lesser extent, 66.3 cells,
indicating that CpG-ODN vaccination induces an immune response

against Her-2/neu and other antigens different than Her-2/neu. No
cytotoxic effect was observed against RENCA cells.
Systemic injection of anti–neu-CpG induces an antitumor
response. Next, we evaluated the antitumor effect of systemic
delivery of anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR in stimulating an
antitumor response. Our data indicate that after i.v. injections of
anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR, tumor growth is significantly
delayed when compared with control groups (Fig. 6A); also, five
of eight BALB-neuT mice rejected the tumor and developed
memory responses (Fig. 6B). I.v. injections of (a) CpG-ODN, (b)
anti-neu, (c) anti-neu + CpG-ODN, and (d) anti-neu + CpG-ODN +
anti-GITR had no antitumor effect (Fig. 6A). These results show
that anti–neu-CpG hybrid molecules are very effective in delivering
the CpG-ODN to the tumor site capable of activating antitumor
responses. To correlate whether the enhanced antitumor response

after anti-GITR injections correspond to the modulation of the
numbers of T-regs, we evaluated whether the levels of T-regs in
spleen and tumor draining LN (TDLN) from animals treated with
anti–neu-CpG alone or anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR were
modified. As shown in Fig. 6C, the addition of anti-GITR drastically
reduces the levels of T-regs in spleen and TDLN. Taken together,
these results confirm that depletion of T-regs is critical to
effectively activate an immune response against self-tumor
antigens (36).

Discussion
We have previously shown that neu mice are immunotolerant to
neu antigen, and immunizations with DCs pulsed with neu
peptides cannot control the tumor growth in these animals

Figure 4. Evaluation of antitumor immune responses induced by anti–neu-CpG. A, to evaluate the generation of memory responses, BALB/c and BALB-neuT
tumor-bearing mice were treated with i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG (as in Fig. 3). Mice that rejected the tumor were challenged with the 106 TUBO cells 70 d after
the primary tumor was implanted. Animals were monitored for the development of tumors and survival. B, to evaluate whether BALB-neuT mice have a similar capacity
to develop memory responses to nominal antigens as BALB/c mice, BALB/c and BALB-neuT were implanted with 105 BM-185-EGFP cells. A control group of animals

tumor-bearing mice, the accumulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-regs within the tumor over time was evaluated. BALB-neuT mice were implanted with 106 TUBO cells on
day 0. Animals were sacrificed on days 10, 20, and 30. Tumors were extracted at the determined times and stained against CD4, CD25, and Foxp3. D, the levels
of accumulation of CD4+Foxp3+ T-regs in spleen, LN, and within the tumor was evaluated in nontreated and treated anti–neu-CpG BALB-neuT mice. BALB-neuT mice
were was implanted with 106 TUBO cells on day 0. Tumor was allowed to grow for 2 wk. Tumors were then treated with i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG (50 Ag/injection)
twice a week for 1 wk. Next day after the last injection, animals were sacrificed. The prevalence of CD4+Foxp3+ T-regs in LN, spleen, and within the tumor was
determined. Four animals were included per group F SD. Data are representative of two experiments.

Figure 5. Analysis of antitumor and immune responses after anti–neu-CpG vaccination plus depletion of T-regs. A, BALB-neuT mice were inoculated s.c. on
day 0 with 106 TUBO cells. On days 9, 16, and 23, animals were injected with anti-CD25, anti-OX40, or anti-GITR (300 Ag/injection). Animals were treated with
anti-CD25, anti-OX40, or anti-GITR alone or in combination with anti–neu-CpG. On day 10, animals started i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG twice a week for
3 wk (50 Ag/injection). Tumor growth and survival (Control, anti–neu-CpG, anti–neu-CpG + anti-OX40, and anti–neu-CpG + anti-GITR ) of all groups
was evaluated. B, animals that rejected the tumor were challenged with the 106 TUBO cells 70 d after the primary tumor was implanted. A significance of
P < 0.001 difference was found between anti–neu-CpG, anti–neu-CpG + anti-OX40 groups of treated mice and BALB-neuT mice treated with anti–neu-CpG
plus anti-GITR. Six to eight animals were included per group. Data are representative of two experiments. C, to evaluate the induction of cytotoxic responses,
BALB-neuT mice were implanted with 106 TUBO cells on day 0. Tumor was allowed to grow for 2 wk. Animals were not treated or treated with anti–neu-CpG
or with anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR. For treatment, animals were i.t. injected with anti–neu-CpG (50 Ag/injection) twice a week for 1 wk. Group of animals
that were treated with anti-GITR mAb received a single injection (300 Ag/injection). Two weeks after the first injection with anti–neu-CpG, animals were sacrificed
and splenocytes were stimulated with irradiated TUBO cells plus feeder cells for 5 d in complete media. Cytotoxic activity of restimulated cultures was
measured against TUBO, 66.3, A2L2, and RENCA (haplotype irrelevant control cells) in standard 6-h 51Cr release assay at 30:1 effector/target ratio. Four animals
were included per group F SD.

Regulation of Antitumor Responses in Tolerant Hosts

Figure 6. Systemic injections of anti–
neu-CpG for the induction of antitumor
responses. To evaluate whether systemic
injection of anti–neu-CpG delivers the
CpG-ODN at the tumor and induces an
antitumor response BALB-neuT mice were
implanted s.c. with 106 TUBO cells on day 0.
On day 10, animals started treatment with
i.v. injections of CpG-ODN, anti–neu-CpG,
anti-neu, anti-neu + CpG + anti-GITR or
anti–neu-CpG + anti-GITR twice a week
(50 Ag/injection) for 3 wk. Anti-GITR was
injected on days 9, 16, and 23 (300 Ag/
injection). A, tumor growth of all groups
was evaluated. B, survival of control and
anti–neu-CpG + anti-GITR is shown.
BALB-neuT mice that rejected the tumor after
i.v. injection of anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR
were challenged with the 106 TUBO cells 70 d
after the primary tumor was implanted. Eight
animals were included per group. A significant
at P < 0.001 difference was found between
anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR and the rest of
the groups. C, analysis of T-regs after
anti–neu-CpG and anti-GITR treatment.
BALB-neuT mice were implanted with 106

with i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG
(50 Ag/injection) twice a week for 1 wk in the
presence or absence of anti-GITR. On the
next day after the last injection, animals
were sacrificed. The prevalence of
CD4+Foxp3+ T-regs in spleen and TDLN from
animals nontreated (Tumor) or treated with
anti–neu-CpG or anti–neu-CpG-ODN plus

(10–14). Therefore, the identification of new vaccination strategies
capable of activating and controlling tumor growth in tolerant host
are needed. Although several studies have indicated that that TLR
ligands could enhance and induce antitumor immune responses in
syngeneic tumor models (18–20), our results indicate that only i.t.
injections of CpG-ODN is able to induce an antitumor response in
Her-2/neu mice (15). The major drawback of i.t. injections of CpGODN is that not all tumors will be physically accessible for i.t.
injections. To target the CpG-ODN to the tumor, we produced a
fusion protein between an antibody directed against the rat neu
molecule and CpG-ODN. Our data confirmed that anti–neu-CpG is
a functional molecule both in vitro and in vivo because it showed
the ability of binding Her-2/neu+ tumor, activating DCs, and
stimulating antitumor responses. Critical for the functional activity
of the hybrid antibody is to use a cleavable linker allowing the
release of the CpG-ODN from the antibody. If a noncleavable linker
was used in the hybrid molecule, no antitumor effect was observed.
The antitumor effect induced by anti–neu-CpG is due to the
activation of an immune response by the CpG-ODN and not
through direct inhibition of TUBO cells through the antibody,
because treatment with anti-neu mAb alone did not have
antitumor effect or the anti–neu-CpG did not inhibit the
proliferation of TUBO cells. The responses induced by anti–neuCpG are dependent on the activation of a cellular response because
the depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells abrogated the
antitumor responses. An interesting observation is that i.t.
injections of anti–neu-CpG induced the rejection of tumors in
100% of BALB/c mice; however, only f30% of BALB-neuT mice
rejected the tumor. Furthermore, BALB/c mice that rejected
tumors could develop protective memory responses against TUBO
cells after i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG. In contrast, BALB-neuT
mice that rejected the TUBO cells succumbed to the tumor after a
second challenge. We confirmed that BALB-neuT mice have the
same capacity to generate primary and memory responses against
nominal antigens as BALB/c mice because both BALB/c and BALBneuT mice rejected the BM-185-EGFP cells and developed a longterm protective memory response against BM-185 wt cells. This
suggests that there are significant differences between tolerant and
nontolerant hosts in generating memory responses against selftumor antigens.
T-regs keep in check self-reactive T cells in peripheral lymphoid
tissues suppressing their activation and effector function (23).
Furthermore, there is accumulative evidence indicating that T-regs
suppress the activation of antitumor immune responses (20–22).
We hypothesize that perhaps the lack of induction of stronger
primary antitumor immune responses and memory response in
BALB-neuT is due to the accumulation and the effect of T-regs on
the low affinity repertoire. Indeed, our results indicate that T-regs
accumulate over time at the tumor site and that the number of
T-regs in spleen and LN also increase in tumor-bearing mice. After
anti–neu-CpG treatment, the numbers of T-regs were reduced 80%
to 85% at the tumor site and f15% in spleen and LN. Despite the
significant reduction in the numbers of T-regs within the tumor
after anti–neu-CpG treatment, BALB-neuT mice could not develop
a memory response. Although we observed lower numbers of
T-regs in spleen and LN after CpG-ODN treatment, there were
sufficient numbers of T-regs that could potentially inhibit the
activation of a memory T-cell response in BALB-neuT mice. These
observations led us to postulate that depletion of T-regs might be
critical for the effective activation of an immune response in BALBneuT mice. Several groups have shown that depletion of T-regs with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

anti-CD25 mAb (37, 38) or IL-2 immunotoxin (39) enhances the
immune responses in BALB-neuT or FVB-neu mice. In contrast, in
our tumor model, anti-CD25 mAb abrogated the antitumor
response. Only when i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR
mAb (40, 41) was combined 100% of the BALB-neuT mice rejected
the first tumor and developed a protective memory response. The
antitumor responses in the presence of anti-GITR correlate with a
stronger cytotoxic activity. This raises the question why anti-GITR
enhances the immune responses whereas anti-CD25 inhibits them.
First, it is important to note that in the studies where anti-CD25
mAb or IL-2 immunotoxin was used to deplete T-regs, these
antibodies were injected before immunizing the animals. Previous
reports have indicated that treatment with anti-CD25 could deplete
the CD4 helper response and CD8 T-effector cells hindering
the immune responses (41). Second, to optimally stimulate an
antitumor response after i.t. injections of CpG-ODN, it was
important to deplete T-regs during the course of the vaccination.
A single injection of anti-GITR or anti-CD25 mAb before or during
the priming or boosting of the immune response was not sufficient
to generate strong primary or secondary responses (data not
shown). Only, when T-regs were depleted during the priming and
boosting of the immune response, a protective memory response
was generated. Third, and most importantly, after anti-GITR
treatment, the levels of T-regs were drastically reduced in the
periphery without affecting the levels of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.
These results are in agreement with the results of Shevach and
Stephens (32), showing reduction of T-regs after anti-GITR
treatment. Treatment with anti-OX40 did not reduce the levels of
T-regs in the periphery (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that
the main action of anti-GITR mAb in our tumor model was to
deplete T-regs (40, 41). However, we cannot rule out that anti-GITR
also enhances the CD8 T-cell responses (33). Another drawback of
using anti-CD25 or IL-2 immunotoxin is that, if these strategies
eliminate or diminish the CD4+ helper response, it could
compromise the generation of memory responses (42). These
results have important clinical implications indicating the
importance of properly selecting a strategy that will specifically
deplete or block T-regs without influencing T-effector CD4+ or
CD8+ cells. Taken together, these data further support the concept
that the residual repertoire for neu antigens in BALB-neuT mice is
heavily influenced by T-regs and the depletion or perturbation of
the suppressive function of T-regs is critical to optimally stimulate
a T-cell response against self-tumor antigens (37).
An important question from these experiments is why BALB/c
can generate a strong primary and memory antitumor response
after i.t. injections of anti–neu-CpG and BALB/neu-T mice could
not. A simple explanation is that, in nontolerant hosts, high-affinity
T cells against the tumor antigen are strongly, rapidly activated and
expanded. Whereas in tolerant hosts, there are a lower numbers of
self-reactive T cells, and these cells are more difficult to activate
and do not expand effectively (10, 43–45). Additionally, it has been
shown that T-regs selectively suppress weak but not strongly
activated T cells that undergo clonal expansion (46). As such, T-regs
will not have the same capacity to suppress T-cell responses in
BALB/c mice, resulting in tumor rejection. However, T-regs could
effectively suppress the low-affinity T cells from BALB-neuT mice.
This is in agreement with the recent findings of Kim and colleagues
(47) that showed that self-reactive T cells are continuously
suppressed by T-regs. Further evaluations are required to better
understand how T-regs influence or control the residual repertoire
against self-tumor antigens.

Regulation of Antitumor Responses in Tolerant Hosts

Although, we did not observe 100% rejection ( five of eight
animals rejected the tumor) of the tumors after i.v. injections of
anti–neu-CpG plus anti-GITR, these results are very encouraging,
indicating the functionality of this hybrid molecule to deliver
the CpG at the tumor site. We are currently optimizing the
doses to increase the efficacy of this antibody and combing it
with small molecules, such as penetratin (48), to increase the
penetration capabilities of these antibodies. Additionally, the use
of the anti–neu-CpG-ODN will have clinical benefits, such as
reducing the possible side effects of injecting high doses of CpGODN. Our data indicate that the lower levels of CpG-ODN
contained in the hybrid molecule is sufficient to induce an
immune response. We believe that the reason why anti–neu-CpG
is effective is because the cleavable linker allows the slow release
of CpG-ODN over time at the tumor site. Further studies are
required to better understand these hybrid molecules. For
example, we are in the process of developing a hybrid molecule
using fluorescent tags CpG-ODN (49); in this manner, we will be
able to trace the CpG-ODN after injecting the anti–neu-CpG
in vivo.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an
antibody–CpG-ODN conjugated molecule has been generated.
These results are very encouraging and show the proof of concept
that antibody–CpG-ODN conjugated molecules are functional

in vitro and in vivo and that they can serve as a new strategy for
fighting cancer. Furthermore, based on the data presented, it can be
argued that anti–neu-CpG could be superior to soluble CpG-ODN
based on the dose applied. We strongly believe that the antibody–
CpG-ODN strategy could open a new field for developing new
targeted therapies and target other tumor antigens, whereby it
would be possible to target single or multiple markers against
tumors. When anti–neu-CpG vaccination was combined with the
depletion of T-regs, it resulted in the rejection of the primary tumor
and the generation of a protective memory response. Taken
together, these results indicate that CpG-ODN–targeted therapy
and the depletion of T-reg optimally activate a primary response
and generate protective memory responses against self-tumor
antigens.
