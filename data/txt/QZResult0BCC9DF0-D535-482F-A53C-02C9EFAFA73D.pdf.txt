BACKGROUND: Epoetin-a initiated once weekly, followed by once-every-3-weeks maintenance, was effective and well tolerated for chemotherapy-induced anemia. This study evaluated a starting dose of epoetin-a
120,000U once every 3 weeks for chemotherapy-induced anemia using early and late initiation regimens.
METHODS: Patients with baseline hemoglobin 11.0-12.0 g/dL were randomly assigned to early intervention
with immediate epoetin-a (n ¼ 68) or to standard intervention with epoetin-a when hemoglobin decreased
to <11 g/dL (n ¼ 68). A third group of patients with baseline hemoglobin <11 g/dL (n ¼ 50) were enrolled
but not randomized; epoetin-a was initiated immediately. The primary endpoint was mean proportion of hemoglobin values within the target range (11.0-13.0 g/dL) among randomized patients. RESULTS: The mean
proportion of hemoglobin values in range through week 16 was 60% in each randomized group. Mean hemoglobin by week showed similar increases over the study. Blood transfusions were administered in 9%,
8%, and 24% of patients in the early, standard, and nonrandomized groups. Mean epoetin-a doses were
similar between treatment groups. Dose reductions and withholds were more common in the early intervention group. Adverse events (eg, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea) were consistent with the safety profile for
epoetin-a . Clinically relevant thrombotic vascular events (regardless of relationship to study treatment)
were reported for 9%, 12%, and 12% of patients in the early, standard, and nonrandomized groups.

KEY WORDS: epoetin-a, drug administration schedule, anemia, antineoplastic agents, hemoglobins, blood

Anemia is a common complication of myelosuppressive chemotherapy that may affect patient function and
quality of life.1 Recombinant human erythropoietin
(epoetin-a) is indicated for the treatment of anemia in
patients with nonmyeloid malignancies for which anemia
is due to the effect of concomitantly administered chemotherapy.2,3 Numerous clinical trials have confirmed the
efficacy of epoetin-a for increasing hemoglobin (Hb) and
decreasing blood transfusions in cancer chemotherapy
patients.4,5
Most clinical trials have evaluated the administration of epoetin-a 3 times weekly or once weekly (qw).
However, an analysis of 4 observational studies of actual
prescribing patterns for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA)
reported that between 22% and 41% of patients were
given epoetin-a once every 2 weeks (q2w) and 3% to 9%
of patients were given epoetin-a once every 3 weeks
(q3w).6 A prospective, randomized comparison of epoetin-a 80,000 U q2w versus 40,000 U qw in the management of CIA reported similar improvement in Hb in both
treatment groups.7 The majority of patients in that study
had a Hb increase of at least 2 g/dL or achieved a Hb level
of at least 12 g/dL. Recent prospective trials reported that
initiating epoetin-a at a dose of 40,000 or 60,000 U qw,
and then extending the dose regimen to 80,000 or
120,000 U q3w, increased Hb and decreased transfusion
requirements.8-10 Initiating therapy with a q3w dose may
be more convenient for the patient than starting with qw
dosing and then extending the interval. To our knowledge, studies of an initial dose of epoetin-a q3w in the
setting of CIA have not been reported.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, including maintenance of Hb between 11.0-13.0 g/
dL, and safety of epoetin-a at an initial dose of 120,000 U
q3w in cancer patients with CIA. Patients with baseline
Hb of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL were randomly assigned to either
early intervention with immediate initiation of epoetin-a
q3w, or standard intervention with initiation of epoetin-a
1122

q3w when Hb decreased to <11.0 g/dL. After the study
was under way, it became evident that enrolling only
patients with baseline Hb between 11.0 and 12.0 g/dL
excluded several patients who might benefit from treatment. In addition, it was assumed that enrollment of
patients with Hb less than 11 g/dL would be more reflective of actual clinical practice, based on published observational evidence that mean Hb levels are less than 10 g/dL
before erythropoiesis-stimulating therapy for CIA.11
Therefore, the protocol was amended to allow enrollment
of patients with Hb <11.0 g/dL and allocation of these
patients to immediate initiation of treatment with epoetin-a q3w.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
This randomized, open-label study was conducted at 24
centers in the United States. Men and women 18 years
of age were eligible for randomization if they had a histologically confirmed nonmyeloid malignancy and a baseline Hb of 11.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Patients who met
the other study criteria but had a baseline Hb <11.0 g/dL
were enrolled to a nonrandomized treatment group. All
patients provided informed written consent to participate.
All patients were required to receive chemotherapy at
week 1. Chemotherapy cycles were to be administered for a
minimum of 9 weeks during the study. Patients were also
required to have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function; iron transferrin saturation (TSAT) >20%; life expectancy of 6 months; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0-2.
Key study exclusion criteria were diagnosis of a myeloid malignancy or known history of myelodysplasia,
planned nonpalliative radiation during the study, current
anemia due to factors other than cancer/chemotherapy,
treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent within
the previous 3 months, untreated central nervous system

metastases, uncontrolled hypertension, seizures, active
second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ), and transfusion of platelets or packed red
blood cells within the prior 28 days. Patients also were
excluded if they had a history of uncontrolled cardiac
arrhythmias (within 6 months), pulmonary emboli, deep
vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, chronic hypercoagulable disorders, or other arterial or venous thrombotic
events.
The study protocol and amendments were reviewed
by an Institutional Review Board. Patients (or their legally
acceptable representatives) signed an informed consent
document before participation in the study. The study
was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, as well as
the International Conference on Harmonization Good
Clinical Practice guidelines.

Interventions
A computer-generated randomization schedule was prepared by the sponsor before the study. The randomization
was balanced using randomly permuted blocks. All study
treatment was administered without concealment.
Epoetin-a was administered subcutaneously by a
health care professional. The initial dosing regimen was
120,000 U q3w in each treatment group. Subsequent
doses were to be administered within 72 hours of the
q3w interval. In the early intervention group, epoetin-a
therapy was initiated at week 1 when Hb was 11.0 to 12.0
g/dL. In the standard intervention group, initiation of
epoetin-a therapy was delayed until Hb decreased to
<11.0 g/dL. In the nonrandomized group, all patients
began study with Hb <11.0 g/dL and epoetin-a therapy
was initiated at week 1.
If Hb rose to >12.0 g/dL or increased by >1.5 g/dL
in a 3-week period during epoetin-a therapy, the dose of
epoetin-a was reduced according to the following
sequence: from 120,000 U q3w to 80,000 U q3w; from
80,000 U q3w to 60,000 U q3w; and from 60,000 U q3w
to 40,000 U q3w. If at any scheduled visit during the
study Hb was >13.0 g/dL, epoetin-a was withheld until
Hb fell to <12.0 g/dL, at which time epoetin-a could be
resumed according to the dose-reduction schedule defined
above. Transfusion-related increases in Hb were not to be
used as the basis for an epoetin-a dose decrease, but epoeCancer

tin-a was always to be held for Hb >13.0 g/dL, regardless
of transfusion. (The study was designed and conducted
before recent label changes recommending initiation of
therapy in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia
only if Hb is <10 g/dL.2,3,12)
If Hb dropped by 1 g/dL after dose reduction, the
previous dose of epoetin-a was restarted. If Hb at any
scheduled visit was <10.0 g/dL after at least 1 dose of
epoetin-a, the patient was considered to have failed q3w
therapy and was treated with epoetin-a 40,000 U qw
starting at that visit. If Hb had not risen by 1 g/dL after
4 weeks at this dose, the dose of epoetin-a was increased
to 60,000 U qw. If Hb had not increased by 1 g/dL
from baseline after 4 weeks at 60,000 U qw, the patient
was considered to have failed qw therapy.
Treatment with epoetin-a was to continue until
week 16 (ie, the last dose could not be administered after
week 15), or through the final cycle of chemotherapy,
whichever came first. All patients were to be followed
weekly for Hb, hematocrit, and blood pressure measurements until 3 weeks after the last dose of epoetin-a, or up
to a maximum of 16 weeks on study, whichever came first.
Patients who received the minimum 9 weeks of chemotherapy were followed weekly for 3 weeks after chemotherapy to be considered completers.
Unless there was a contraindication to iron therapy,
patients were to receive ferrous sulfate 325 mg orally once
daily, an equivalent oral formulation of iron as tolerated,
or an equivalent intravenous formulation of iron. Transfusions could be administered throughout the study when
Hb fell below a ‘‘transfusion trigger’’ that was predefined
for each site per local transfusion policy.

Data Collection
The entire study period was up to 22 weeks, with a screening phase lasting up to 2 weeks, study treatment for up to
16 weeks, and safety follow-up for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, Hb, and hematocrit were measured once weekly. A
quality-of-life assessment, the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) scale,13 was administered at study baseline, just before the first dose of epoetin-a (in the standard intervention group only), and at
weeks 7 and 16. Assessments performed at baseline and
week 16 (or the time of early study completion) included
iron indices, folate, and serum vitamin B12. Transfusion
1123

data recorded included number of units, date, type, pretransfusion and posttransfusion Hb, and reason for transfusion. Adverse event information was recorded at weekly
study visits.

Statistical Analysis
Demographics and baseline characteristics were analyzed
for all enrolled patients. Analyses of efficacy endpoints
were performed using the modified intent-to-treat
(mITT) population, which included all patients who had
at least 1 postbaseline Hb value. Safety results were summarized for the safety population, which included all
patients who received at least 1 study dose.
There were no statistical comparisons between treatment groups. Continuous variables were summarized by
treatment group using descriptive statistics. Categorical
variables were summarized by treatment group using
frequency statistics.
The primary efficacy endpoint was ‘‘percent values
in range,’’ defined as the mean proportion of weekly Hb
values during chemotherapy treatment that were 11.0
g/dL and 13.0 g/dL among randomized patients. The
primary efficacy endpoint was not evaluated in the nonrandomized group. The secondary efficacy endpoint of
‘‘complete success’’ was defined as maintenance of all
weekly Hb values during epoetin-a treatment between
11.0 and 13.0 g/dL, beginning at week 1 in the early intervention group and once Hb was 11.0 g/dL in the standard intervention group. Another secondary efficacy
endpoint was the proportion of patients whose mean
weekly Hb level was between 11.0 and 13.0 g/dL.
Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean Hb
values by week, mean scores on the FACT-F scale, and
blood transfusion data after week 4 of epoetin-a treatment, including the proportion of patients who received
at least 1 transfusion, the number of units transfused, and
the pretransfusion Hb. Summaries of weekly Hb values
were performed using observed data as well as the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method to estimate
missing values and to impute values for 28 days after a
transfusion. For both methodologies, Hb values collected
from patients after a switch in dosing from q3w to qw
treatment were excluded.
Adverse events were summarized by severity and
possible relationship to study treatment, as well as discon1124

tinuation of study treatment due to adverse event. Each
patient contributed only once for multiple occurrences of
the same event. Other safety endpoints included the proportion of patients with an Hb increase of 1 g/dL within
a 2-week period and an increase of 1.5 g/dL within a 2week period. Special attention was given to all thrombotic
vascular events and thrombotic vascular events considered
clinically relevant; the incidences of these events were
determined overall, among patients with rapid Hb rise (ie,
1 g/dL in a 2-week period), and among patients with
elevated Hb (ie, >13 g/dL).

RESULTS
Study Participants
The study was conducted between June 2005 and August
2006. Disposition of study participants is summarized in
Figure 1. Of the 364 potential participants who were
screened, 186 were enrolled. There were 136 patients who
had baseline Hb between 11.0 and 12.0 g/dL and were
randomly assigned to the early intervention group (n ¼
68) or the standard intervention group (n ¼ 68), and 50
patients who had baseline Hb <11.0 g/dL and were enrolled directly to the nonrandomized group. The mITT
population included 68 (100%) patients in the early intervention group, 67 (99%) patients in the standard intervention group, and 49 (98%) patients in the
nonrandomized group who had at least 1 Hb value
recorded after baseline.
Seventeen (25%) patients in the standard intervention group never received epoetin-a because their Hb
remained 11.0 g/dL or greater throughout the study. The
remaining 169 study participants received at least 1 dose
of epoetin-a and were included in the safety analyses.
There were 12 (18%) patients in the early intervention
group, 15 (22%) patients in the standard intervention
group, and 18 (36%) patients in the nonrandomized
group who discontinued study treatment early. The leading reasons for early discontinuation were patient request,
adverse event, noncompliance with the dosing regimen,
and stopping chemotherapy early.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the
safety population were similar between the treatment
groups at baseline (Table 1). Mean age was between 60
and 62 years in each group. Patients were predominantly

female and white. The most common tumor types were
breast, gastrointestinal, and lung. Most patients had
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at baseline, and the
majority had metastases. The mean Hb level at baseline
was 11.5 g/dL in each of the randomized treatment
groups and 10.1 g/dL in the nonrandomized group.
Treatments Administered
There were 16 (24%) patients in the early intervention
group, 17 of 51 (33%) treated patients in the standard
intervention group, and 20 (40%) patients in the nonrandomized group who were not responsive to q3w treatment and switched to qw dosing. Among the patients who
received at least 1 dose of epoetin-a, the mean (SD) cumulative dose of both q3w and qw doses combined was
421,177 (147,936) U in the early intervention group,
415,686 (148,395) U in the standard intervention group,
and 442,000 (187,453) U in the nonrandomized group.
Ninety-three percent of study participants received
some form of concomitant iron supplementation, most
commonly bivalent oral iron preparations (90% of
patients) such as ferrous sulfate (55% of patients); no
patient received intravenous iron therapy.
For patients who switched from q3w dosing to qw
dosing, postswitch data were included in the analyses of
dose reductions and withholds. One or more dose reductions was required during the study for 30 (44%) patients
in the early intervention group, 13 of 51 (25%) treated
patients in the standard intervention group, and 12
(24%) patients in the nonrandomized group. Likewise,
withholds tended to occur more commonly in the early
intervention group than in the other groups. Epoetin-a
was withheld at least once for 31 (46%) patients in the
early intervention group, 17 of 51 (33%) treated patients
in the standard intervention group, and 17 (34%) patients
in the nonrandomized group.
Hemoglobin
Analysis of weekly Hb values using observed data (excluding values for 28 days after transfusion) showed a gradual
increase in Hb values over time (Fig. 2A,B). Similar
increases were also seen with LOCF methodology.
The mean values for the primary study endpoint—
the proportion of weekly Hb values during chemotherapy
treatment in the target range of 11.0 to 13.0 g/dL—were
60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53% to 67%) in the

early intervention group and 60% (95% CI, 53% to
67%) in the standard intervention group. Complete success, which was defined as maintaining all Hb values
between 11.0 and 13.0 g/dL during treatment with epoetin-a q3w alone, was achieved by 4 (6%) patients in the
early intervention group. In the standard intervention
group, 41 patients achieved at least 1 Hb value 11.0 g/
dL during epoetin-a q3w therapy, and 5 (12%) of these
patients had complete success thereafter.
There were 49 (72%) patients in the early intervention group who had a mean Hb level between 11.0 and
13.0 g/dL. Of the 41 standard intervention patients who
received epoetin-a therapy and achieved Hb 11.0 g/dL,
28 (68%) patients maintained a mean Hb level between
11.0 and 13.0 g/dL during epoetin-a therapy.
Mean Hb remained between 11.0 and 12.0 g/dL at
every week of study in each of the randomized groups,

and between 10.0 and 10.5 g/dL at every week in the nonrandomized group. Among the 51 patients whose Hb fell
below 11.0 g/dL in the standard intervention group, Hb
decreased to a mean of 10.4 g/dL before initiation of
epoetin-a and the subsequent mean increase in Hb was
0.7 g/dL at the final visit on q3w therapy. Secondary analyses of Hb were performed separately for patients who did
not switch to qw dosing during the study. Using observed
data in this population, mean Hb increased significantly
(P < .05) from baseline at weeks 3 through 16 in the early
intervention group (n ¼ 52), at weeks 11 through 16 in
the standard intervention group (n ¼ 50, including
patients who received only q3w dosing and those who
never received epoetin-a), and at weeks 2 through 16 in
the nonrandomized group (n ¼ 29).

Blood Transfusions
Use of blood transfusions is summarized in Table 2. At
least 1 blood transfusion was given after 4 weeks of treatment for 6 (9%) of 68 treated patients in the early intervention group, 4 (8%) of 51 treated patients in the
standard intervention group, and 12 (24%) patients in
the nonrandomized group. The mean number of units
transfused after 4 weeks of treatment was 2.3 U in the
early intervention group, 6.0 U in the standard intervention group (1 of these patients received 12 U of blood),
and 3.3 U in the nonrandomized group. Mean Hb before
transfusion after 4 weeks on treatment was 8.2 g/dL in the
early intervention group, 8.3 g/dL in the standard intervention group, and 7.8 g/dL in the nonrandomized
group.
Quality of Life

standard intervention group, and 29.3  12.4 in the nonrandomized group; at the final visit, the mean (  SD)
values were 32.0  13.2, 30.4  11.7, and 28.1  14.1,
respectively.
Safety
All 169 patients who received epoetin-a were included in
the safety analyses. An Hb increase of at least 1.0 g/dL
within a 2-week period was observed in 57 (84%) patients
in the early intervention group, 45 (88%) patients in the
standard intervention group, and 34 (68%) patients in
the nonrandomized group. An increase of 1.5 g/dL or
more within a 2-week period was observed in 38 (56%)
patients in the early intervention group, 31 (61%)
patients in the standard intervention group, and 21
(42%) patients in the nonrandomized group. There were
28 (41%) patients in the early intervention group, 15
(29%) in the standard intervention group, and 11 (22%)
in the nonrandomized group who had at least 1 Hb
greater than 13.0 g/dL.
Most patients (97% in the early intervention group,
98% in the standard intervention group, and 98% in the
nonrandomized group) experienced at least 1 adverse
event during the study, regardless of association with
study treatment. Adverse events experienced by at least
10% of patients are displayed in Table 3.
Of the 30 drug-related adverse events reported, 22
were considered possibly related to study drug, 4 were
considered probably related to study drug, and 4 (pain,
injection-site pain, bone pain, and deep vein thrombosis)
were considered very likely related to study drug. Three
adverse events of disease progression resulted in discontinuation of epoetin-a treatment, but no treatment-related

DISCUSSION
This investigational study was the first prospective evaluation of an initial dose of epoetin-a on a q3w dosing schedule in the management of CIA. Randomization to early
intervention (initiation of epoetin-a q3w when Hb was
between 11.0 and 12.0 g/dL) or standard intervention
(initiation of epoetin-a q3w when Hb decreased below
11.0 g/dL) resulted in similar safety and efficacy among
patients receiving epoetin-a 120,000 U q3w. In both
groups, a mean proportion of 60% of Hb values were in
the study-specified target range of 11.0 to 13.0 g/dL during chemotherapy treatment and both approaches
resulted in maintenance of mean Hb within this range
every week of study. On-study average Hb values during
epoetin-a therapy were within this range for most
patients. Some patients were able to achieve Hb within
this range throughout treatment with epoetin-a q3w.
Weekly Hb values increased over time when all
observed data were included in the analysis. Mean Hb did

not increase significantly from baseline when the data
were analyzed with LOCF methodology, but significant
improvement was observed in the subgroup of patients
who never switched to qw dosing.
Given the low rates of transfusion in the randomized
patients, consistent control of Hb in this study was
achieved with epoetin-a q3w, as reported previously in
studies of qw dosing followed by q3w dosing8-10 and studies that used more frequent administration of epoetin-a
throughout treatment.4,5 Blood transfusion in the present
study was more common among the nonrandomized
patients (24%) than the randomized patients (8% to 9%).
This finding was consistent with the baseline Hb levels in
each group, which were approximately 1.5 g/dL lower in
the nonrandomized group than in the randomized
groups. One could argue that the higher rate of transfusion in the nonrandomized patients was expected based
on the study design because it isolated a group of patients
who were more anemic even before they received chemotherapy on study. Heavy pretreatment with chemotherapy
before enrollment or other reasons to be anemic, such as
advanced disease with severe inflammation, may have
contributed to more severe baseline anemia. However, the
sample size is too small to be definitive. The patients who
were randomized to the standard intervention group were
followed closely and epoetin-a therapy was begun when
their Hb level dropped below 11 g/dL, whereas those in
the nonrandomized group were initiated on epoetin-a
therapy with an Hb level already below 11 g/dL.
The safety of epoetin-a in the present study was consistent with product labeling for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in cancer chemotherapy patients.2,3,12 Epoetin1130

a was generally well tolerated with an initial q3w dose.
Three patients had thrombotic vascular events that were
considered related to study treatment, including 1 serious
treatment-related event, but no patient discontinued therapy due to a thrombotic vascular event.
An analysis of thrombotic vascular events among
patients with rapid rise in Hb (1 g/dL in a 2-week period) or a single elevated Hb level (13 g/dL) did not
demonstrate a consistent association between elevations
in Hb and the risk of thrombotic vascular events in this
study. These findings are consistent with previous studies that documented no increased risk of thrombotic
events with the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
for chemotherapy-induced anemia when Hb is <11 g/
dL.4 However, data from other clinical trials have
reported the potential risks of increased tumor progression and decreased overall survival associated with higher
target Hb levels for therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in anemic cancer patients.2,3,12 The present
study was designed and conducted before much of this
research was published. Progression and survival were
not assessed as safety endpoints in the present study.
Numerically, there were more deaths in the nonrandomized arm than the other 2 arms. As discussed above, this
finding may reflect that the patients in the nonrandomized arm were different from the patients in the randomized groups, in that they were sicker at baseline given
their lower baseline hemoglobin and therefore inherently
more likely to have an adverse outcome over time. The
lack of a randomized comparator arm and a small sample
precludes us from drawing any conclusions about the
deaths in this study.

Potential study limitations included the lack of a double-blind comparator group or comparative statistical analyses, and the amendment to the study design after some of
the patients had been enrolled. A double-blind comparator
group and comparative statistical testing were not included
in the study design because previous studies had demonstrated the hematologic efficacy of epoetin-a relative to placebo in the management of chemotherapy-induced
anemia.4,5 This study was amended after enrollment had
begun when it was determined that many patients who
might benefit from treatment were being excluded from
enrollment because they to Hb levels <11 g/dL at screening.
The addition of this third treatment group provided the
study with much greater applicability to clinical practice
because chemotherapy-induced anemia often presents with
Hb levels <11 g/dL, but it also may have introduced some
bias by including a group of patients who might have been
inherently different as described above.
This study demonstrated that early and standard intervention with epoetin-a every 3 weeks increased and maintained Hb levels within 11.0-13.0 g/dL in anemic patients
with cancer receiving concomitant chemotherapy. Patients
were treated to a target Hb range of 11.0-13.0 g/dL based
on guidelines in place at the time of protocol development.14,15 Recently revised product labeling for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the United States now specifies
that therapy should not be initiated in patients with Hb
10 g/dL and doses should be titrated for each patient to
achieve and maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid
the need for blood transfusion.2,3,12 In addition, ESA
administration should be discontinued following the completion of a chemotherapy course.
