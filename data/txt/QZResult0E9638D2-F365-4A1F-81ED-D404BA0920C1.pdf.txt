SUMMARY
Therapeutic antibodies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) activate tumor-specific
immunity and have shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of melanoma. Yet, little is known
about tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 pathway effects. Here we show that murine and human
melanomas contain PD-1-expressing cancer subpopulations and demonstrate that melanoma cellintrinsic PD-1 promotes tumorigenesis, even in mice lacking adaptive immunity. PD-1 inhibition

signaling motifs suppresses tumor growth in immunocompetent, immunocompromised and PD-1deficient tumor graft recipient mice. Conversely, melanoma-specific PD-1 overexpression
enhances tumorigenicity, as does engagement of melanoma-PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, whereas
melanoma-PD-L1 inhibition or knockout of host-PD-L1 attenuate growth of PD-1-positive
melanomas. Mechanistically, the melanoma-PD-1 receptor modulates downstream effectors of
mTOR signaling. Our results identify melanoma cell-intrinsic functions of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis in
tumor growth and suggest that blocking melanoma-PD-1 might contribute to the striking clinical
efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Immune checkpoints are crucial regulatory pathways that maintain immune homeostasis by
modulating the amplitude and quality of several adaptive and innate effector mechanisms in
favor of immunogenic tolerance (Pardoll, 2012). Using various strategies, such as triggering
functional exhaustion of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), cancers exploit
immune checkpoints to evade antitumor immunity. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a
prominent checkpoint receptor that, upon engagement by its ligands, PD-L1 (also known as
B7-H1) or PD-L2 (also known as B7-DC), dampens T-effector functions by inhibiting
signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (Topalian et al., 2012a). Thus,
expression of PD-1 ligands, and particularly PD-L1, in the tumor microenvironment (TME)
protects cancers from immune-mediated rejection (Dong et al., 2002; Topalian et al., 2012a).
Consequently, a number of antibody-based therapeutics targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 axis have
entered clinical development or have been approved for melanoma therapy (Postow et al.,
2015).

Author Manuscript

In phase I trials (Hamid et al., 2013; Herbst et al., 2014; Topalian et al., 2012b; Wolchok et
al., 2013), PD-1 pathway blockade demonstrated unprecedented response rates and
encouraging toxicity profiles in patients with advanced-stage cancers of various etiologies,
including malignant melanoma. On the basis of recent phase III data demonstrating
improved overall survival in melanoma patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors compared to those
treated with chemotherapy, the FDA approved two anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and
pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who are no longer
responding to other drugs (Postow et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015). PD-L1 expression by
cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Herbst et al., 2014; Topalian et al.,
2012b; Tumeh et al., 2014), the presence of type 1 T-helper cell (Th1)-associated
inflammatory mediators (Herbst et al., 2014; Tumeh et al., 2014), increased density and
proliferation and decreased diversity in antigen-specificity of CD8+ T-cells (Tumeh et al.,
2014), and the frequency of tumor-associated neo-antigens within the TME (Gubin et al.,
2014; Rizvi et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2014) are associated with clinical response to PD-1

pathway interference. These findings established that optimal anti-PD-1 cancer therapeutic
efficacy requires the activation and expansion of tumor-specific T-cell immunity.

However, in addition to benefiting patients afflicted with immunogenic cancers, such as
malignant melanoma (Hamid et al., 2013; Herbst et al., 2014; Topalian et al., 2012b;
Wolchok et al., 2013), PD-1 pathway blockade has also yielded meaningful clinical activity
in patients with lesser immunogenic cancers that have hitherto not typically responded to
immunotherapy (Herbst et al., 2014; Topalian et al., 2012b). Moreover, patients with
advanced melanoma refractory to treatment with ipilimumab, an FDA-approved antibody
targeting the immune checkpoint protein, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4,
showed marked clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy (Hamid et al., 2013; Weber et al.,
2015; Wolchok et al., 2013). While the presence of neo-antigens and an immune-active
TME are similarly associated with favorable outcome in melanoma patients treated with
either PD-1- (Gubin et al., 2014; Rizvi et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2014) or CTLA-4-directed
checkpoint blockade (Snyder et al., 2014), current evidence suggests that PD-1 inhibitors
produce greater anticancer activity and fewer immune-related adverse events than
ipilimumab (Postow et al., 2015). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility
that anti-PD-1 therapy, in addition to deregulating T-cell specific immune checkpoint
functions, may also inhibit complementary protumorigenic mechanisms, thereby
contributing to its superior clinical efficacy compared to CTLA-4 blockade. Because PD-1 is
not only expressed by immune cells, but also by melanoma subpopulations with enhanced
tumorigenicity, even in highly immunocompromised tumor xenograft recipient mice
(Schatton et al., 2010), we hypothesized that the growth-suppressive effects of PD-1 therapy
might also partially result from the direct inhibition of this protein on melanoma cells.

Author Manuscript

Here we report that established human and murine melanoma cell lines as well as clinical
melanomas frequently contain PD-1-expressing cancer subpopulations, and that enforced
melanoma-PD-1 expression enhances melanoma growth, even in the absence of adaptive
immunity. Conversely, antibody-mediated melanoma-PD-1 blockade, melanoma-specific
PD-1 knockdown, as well as mutagenesis of melanoma-PD-1 signaling motifs inhibit tumor
growth, independently of adaptive immunity. Efficient melanoma-PD-1-driven
tumorigenesis requires melanoma-PD-1 interactions with its predominant ligand, PD-L1,
which activate effectors of the mTOR signaling pathway downstream of the melanomaPD-1 receptor. Our results expand our current understanding of PD-1 pathway functions in
melanoma, and suggest that cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 targeting might significantly
contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 antibodies, rendering PD-1 inhibition, in
conjunction with its demonstrated effect on immune checkpoint blockade, superior to
alternative therapies that target immune checkpoints alone.

RESULTS
Melanomas frequently contain PD-1-expressing cancer subpopulations
We first examined PD-1 expression in a series of melanoma patient samples and established
melanoma cell lines, to further expand upon the potential clinical significance of our
previous demonstration that melanoma cells can express PD-1 (Schatton et al., 2010). Flow
cytometric analysis of single cell suspensions derived from clinical tumor specimens (n=8

patients) revealed PD-1 surface protein expression by melanoma subpopulations negative
for the pan-lymphocyte marker, CD45, and the endothelial marker, CD31, in 8/8 melanoma
specimens examined, with tumor cell frequencies ranging from 3.5% to 16.5% (cell
frequency 8.7%, 1.5%, mean + SEMs, Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Immunofluorescence doublelabeling of clinical melanoma biopsies (n=50) for PD-1 and the melanoma antigen
recognized by T-cells (MART)-1 further confirmed PD-1 protein expression by
subpopulations of MART-1+ melanoma cells that were cytologically distinct from CD45+
lymphocytes (Fig.1B), with n=22/36 melanoma patients demonstrating melanoma-PD-1
positivity in at least one of their tumor lesions (Table S1).

Based on our intention to mechanistically dissect the role of melanoma-expressed PD-1 in
experimental tumor growth, we next characterized PD-1 expression in established human
and murine melanoma cell lines. RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the full coding
sequence (CDS) of the human PD-1 (PDCD1) gene revealed PDCD1 mRNA expression
(Fig.1C), and immunoblot analysis demonstrated PD-1 protein expression by human A375,
C8161 and G3361 melanoma cells (Fig.1D). Flow cytometric analyses showed PD-1 surface
protein expression by 8/8 melanoma lines tested, with PD-1+ tumor cell frequencies ranging
from 11.3%±1.2% to 29.5%±3.7% (mean±SEM Fig. 1E), and revealed preferential PD-1
expression by melanoma cell subsets positive for the tumor-initiating cell determinant
(Schatton et al., 2008), ABCB5 (Fig. S2A–C), consistent with our previous demonstration of
preferential PD-1 expression by melanoma-initiating cells (Schatton et al., 2010). Human
melanoma lines also demonstrated positivity for both PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2,
ranging from 2.4%±0.1% to 99.2%±0.1% and 0.6%±0.1% to 88.9%±2.6% of cells (mean
±SEM), respectively (Fig. S1B), and PD-1 co-expression with its ligands (not shown).
Murine B16-F0 and B16-F10 cultures also expressed both PD-1 (Pdcd1) mRNA, as
determined by amplification and sequencing of the full Pdcd1 CDS (Fig. 1F), and PD-1
protein as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1G). Flow cytometric analysis revealed PD-1
(cell frequency 9.4%±2.5% and 6.6%±2.4%, mean±SEM, Fig. 1H) and PD-L1 (43.4%
±9.4% and 37.5%±2.3%), but not PD-L2 surface protein expression by B16-F0 and B16F10 melanoma cells (Fig. S1C). B16 melanoma grafts grown in non-obese diabetic severely
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) γ-chain(-/-) null
(NSG) mice lacking adaptive immunity also demonstrated PD-1 expression by MART-1+
melanoma cells (Fig. 1).
Melanoma-expressed PD-1 promotes murine tumor growth

Author Manuscript

To functionally dissect the potential role of melanoma-expressed PD-1 in tumor growth, we
generated stable Pdcd1 knockdown (KD) and Pdcd1-overexpressing (OE) B16 melanoma
lines. Transduction of B16-F0 and B16-F10 cells with two distinct short hairpin (sh) RNAs
targeting Pdcd1 inhibited murine PD-1 mRNA expression by ≥59% and significantly
blocked PD-1 protein expression compared to controls (Fig.2A), but did not significantly
alter expression of PD-L1 or PD-L2, respectively (not shown). Conversely, transduction of
B16 cells with Pdcd1-encoding constructs resulted in upregulation of PD-1, both at the
mRNA and protein level (Fig.2B). Melanoma-specific Pdcd1-KD resulted in decreased and
Pdcd1-OE in increased B16-F0 and B16-F10 melanoma growth in immunocompetent
C57BL/6 mice compared to that of vector controls (Fig.2C). Pdcd1-KD melanoma grafts

demonstrated diminished (Fig. S3A) and Pdcd1-OE melanomas significantly enhanced
Pdcd1 mRNA and PD-1 protein expression compared to control tumors at the experimental
endpoint (Fig. S3B). We next compared the tumorigenic ability of native PD-1+- vs. PD-1−sorted B16-F0 and B16-F10 melanoma cells and found that PD-1+ subpopulations
demonstrated significantly increased growth in C57BL/6 mice compared to PD-1− cells
(Fig. S2C). Together, these findings identify melanoma-expressed PD-1 as a protumorigenic
mechanism.

PD-1 expressed by cells of the adaptive immune system has been established as a modulator
of tumor-specific immunity (Topalian et al., 2012a). To determine whether the observed
tumor growth-accelerating effects of melanoma-expressed PD-1 depend on melanomaPD-1:lymphocyte interactions, we compared the abilities of Pdcd1-KD and Pdcd1-OE vs.
control B16 melanomas to initiate tumor growth in immunocompromised, T- and B-celldeficient NSG mice. We found that Pdcd1-KD inhibited and Pdcd1 overexpression
increased tumorigenicity of B16-F0 and B16-F10 melanomas in NSG mice compared to
controls (Fig.2D), suggesting lymphocyte-independent roles of melanoma-PD-1 in
tumorigenesis. Significant Pdcd1-KD (Fig. S4A) and overexpression (Fig. S4B) in B16
melanoma grafts was confirmed after in vivo growth. Consistent with our findings using
Pdccd1-overexpressing melanoma variants, we found that PD-1+ melanoma subpopulations
purified from native B16-F0 and B16-F10 lines demonstrated increased tumorigenicity in
NSG mice compared to PD-1− cell isolates (Fig. S3C). We next examined whether
melanoma-specific Pdcd1 silencing or overexpression affects melanoma cell growth in vitro,
in the complete absence of immune cells, using an established culture system designed for
the study of tumorigenic minority populations (Aceto et al., 2012; Civenni et al., 2011).
Consistent with our in vivo findings, Pdcd1-KD impaired (Fig.2E) and Pdcd1-OE promoted
in vitro three-dimensional B16-F0 and B16-F10 culture growth compared to respective
controls (Fig.2F). Because PD-1 receptor signaling in T-cells modulates several downstream
pathways (Riley, 2009) that also serve critical roles in melanomagenesis (Flaherty et al.,
2012), such as MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling, we next examined
melanoma-Pdcd1-specific changes in phospho (p)-ERK1/2, p-AKT, and p-S6 ribosomal
protein levels. Pdcd1-KD reduced (Fig. 2E) and Pdcd1-OE increased phosphorylation of the
mTOR effector molecule, S6, compared to control B16 melanoma cells (Fig. 2F), indicating
melanoma cell-intrinsic, PD-1-mediated induction of protumorigenic mTOR pathway
activity. Together, these in vitro findings suggest lymphocyte-independent, cancer cellintrinsic functions of melanoma-expressed PD-1 in tumor growth.
Melanoma-PD-1:PD-L1 interactions promote murine melanoma growth

Author Manuscript

We next examined whether ligation of melanoma-PD-1 to its predominant ligand, PD-L1, is
required for PD-1-driven tumorigenesis. To test whether melanoma-PD-1:host-PD-L1
interactions promote tumor growth in the absence of adaptive immunity, we grafted Pdcd1OE vs. control B16-F10 cells to wildtype Rag(−/−) vs. PD-L1(−/−) KO Rag(−/−) mice
(Francisco et al., 2009). We found that the growth of Pdcd1-OE melanomas was attenuated
in PD-L1(−/−) KO Rag(−/−) compared to PD-L1(+/+) Rag(−/−) recipients (Fig. S5A). To
examine if PD-L1 expressed by melanoma cells (Fig. S1) also contributes to melanomaPD-1-dependent tumorigenesis, we treated PD-L1(−/−) KO Rag(−/−) vs. wildtype Rag(−/−)

mice grafted with Pdcd1-OE melanomas with a PD-L1 blocking antibody. We found that
PD-L1 blockade inhibited Pdcd1-OE B16-F10 melanoma growth compared to isotype
control antibody treatment in PD-L1(−/−) KO mice (Fig.3A). Additionally, PD-L1 antibody
treatment resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth of Pdcd1-OE melanomas in PDL1(−/−) KO Rag(−/−) compared to wildtype Rag(−/−) mice (Fig.3A). These findings
suggest growth-accelerating functions not only of host-PD-L1:melanoma-PD-1, but also of
melanoma-PD-L1:melanoma-PD-1 interactions.

To further demonstrate protumorigenic melanoma-PD-L1 effects in the absence of adaptive
immunity, we generated PD-L1 gene (Cd274, also known as Pdcd1lg1)-KD B16-F10
melanoma cells (Fig. S5B) and tested their ability to maintain culture growth and form
tumors. Compared to vector controls, Pdcd1lg1 silencing impaired three-dimensional B16
melanoma growth in vitro (Fig. S5C) and in vivo tumorigenesis in both immunocompetent
C57BL/6 and immunocompromised NSG mice (Fig. S5D). Moreover, Pdcd1lg1-KD
reversed the significant increase in tumorigenicity of Pdcd1-OE vs. vector control B16-F10
melanoma cells in C57BL/6 and NSG mice (Fig.3B). To further demonstrate that PD-L1
interactions with melanoma-PD-1 promote melanoma growth, we treated native B16-F0 and
B16-F10 cultures with a recombinant PD-L1 Fc-fusion protein (PD-L1 Ig), known to elicit
changes in PD-1 receptor signaling in T-cells (Francisco et al., 2009). Compared to control
Ig treatment, addition of PD-L1 Ig to B16 cultures significantly augmented threedimensional growth and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig.3C). Because both
PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling are known to feed into downstream S6 phosphorylation, we
examined whether pharmacologic inhibition of either pathway can reverse the observed
increase in p-S6 expression. We found that mTOR pathway blockade (via rapamycin or
PP242) but not PI3K inhibition (via wortmannin or LY294002) suppressed the PD-L1 Igdependent phosphorylation of S6 in murine B16-F10 melanoma cells (Fig. 3D). Together,
these findings demonstrate that interactions between melanoma-expressed PD-1 with its
ligand, PD-L1, promote tumor growth and activate mTOR signaling.
Tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 signaling is required for efficient murine melanoma growth

Author Manuscript

To determine whether melanoma cell-intrinsic PD-1 signaling is required for efficient tumor
growth, we generated Pdcd1-OE B16 variants containing tyrosine to phenylalanine single
point mutations of two PD-1 signaling motifs, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM, disrupted by Y225F mutation) and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch
motif (ITSM, disrupted by Y248F mutation), within the cytoplasmic tail of melanoma-PD-1
(Fig.3E). A construct containing point mutations of both tyrosines (Y225F/Y248F) was also
created. In immune cells, ITIM and ITSM play pivotal roles in PD-1 signaling (Riley, 2009).
Transduction of wildtype vs. mutant Pdcd1-constructs into B16-F0 or B16-F10 melanoma
cells resulted in similarly high expression levels of PD-1 (Fig.3F and Fig. S5E), permitting a
direct comparison between wildtype Pdcd1-OE and each of the mutant variants. Strikingly,
mutation of either one (Y225F or Y248F) or both (Y225F/Y248F) melanoma-PD-1
signaling motifs significantly abrogated the increased tumor growth observed in both
C57BL/6 and NSG mice grafted with wildtype Pdcd1-OE vs. vector-control B16 melanoma
variants (Fig.3G and Fig. S5F), suppressed three-dimensional tumor growth in vitro (Fig.3H

and Fig. S5G), and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 3I) compared to enforced
expression of wildtype Pdcd1, respectively.
Melanoma cell-intrinsic PD-1 enhances human tumor xenograft growth

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next analyzed the effects of melanoma-specific PD-1 knockdown vs. PD-1
overexpression on human melanoma xenograft growth. Transduction of human A375,
C8161, or G3361 melanoma cells with two distinct PDCD1-shRNAs significantly inhibited
PD-1 mRNA expression and blocked PD-1 protein expression between 53–75% (Fig. S6A),
and infection with PDCD1-OE constructs resulted in marked upregulation of PD-1, both at
the mRNA and protein level (>90% positivity), respectively (Fig. S6B). PDCD1-KD
significantly inhibited and PDCD1-OE markedly increased human melanoma xenograft
growth in NSG mice compared to vector control-transduced A375, C8161, or G3361 tumors
(Fig.4A). Preservation of PDCD1 silencing and overexpression were confirmed for all
melanoma xenografts at the experimental endpoint, respectively (Fig. S6C and S6D).
Moreover, PD-1+ cancer cell subsets purified from native C8161 cultures showed
significantly increased tumorigenicity in NSG mice, compared to PD-1− C8161 cells (Fig.
S6E). Consistent with our in vivo findings, PDCD1-KD impaired and PDCD1-OE promoted
three-dimensional A375, C8161, and G3361 culture growth compared to controls (Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, relative to control Ig treatment, addition of human PD-L1 Ig augmented tumor
sphere formation of A375 and G3361, but not C8161 melanoma cultures (Fig. 4B), the latter
of which express greater than 3-fold higher endogenous PD-L1 levels than A375 and G3361
cells (Fig. S1B). Similar to our findings in murine B16 cells, human PDCD1-KD lines
showed a reduction and PDCD1-OE and PD-L1 Ig-treated human G3361 melanoma cells an
increase in p-S6 levels compared to respective controls (Fig.4C). Additionally,
pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR but not PI3K signaling blocked the increase in p-S6
expression in PD-L1 Ig compared to control Ig-treated human G3361 melanoma cells (Fig.
4D), indicating mTOR pathway dependence of S6 phosphorylation downstream of the
melanoma-PD-1 receptor, consistent with our findings in murine B16 melanoma cells (Fig.
3D).

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, generation of human PDCD1-OE ITIM (Y223F) and/or ITSM (Y248F) mutant
A375 and C8161 cell lines (Fig.4E) with similarly high expression levels of human PD-1
(Fig.4F) revealed that mutation of either one (Y223F or Y248F) or both (Y223F/Y248F)
signaling motifs within the melanoma-PD-1 cytoplasmic tail abrogated the increased tumor
growth observed in mice grafted with wildtype PDCD1-OE vs. vector-control A375 or
C8161 variants (Fig.4G). Additionally, Y223F-, Y248F-, and Y223F/Y248F-mutant
PDCD1-OE C8161 melanoma cells demonstrated significantly impaired three-dimensional
culture growth (Fig.4H) and reduced p-S6 levels compared to wildtype PDCD1-OE C8161
cells (Fig.4I). Together, these findings identify PD-1 expressed by human melanoma cells as
a lymphocyte-independent tumor growth-accelerating mechanism.
Antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1 on melanoma cells inhibits murine melanoma growth
We next examined whether antibody-mediated melanoma-PD-1 blockade significantly
inhibits tumor growth, even in immunocompromised NSG hosts, as would be expected
based upon the herein demonstrated melanoma cell-intrinsic, protumorigenic PD-1 receptor

functions. First, administration of a PD-1 blocking antibody to immunocompetent, C57BL/6
recipients starting one day before inoculation with B16-F10 cells resulted in modest
inhibition of melanoma growth between days 5 and 11 post inoculation (P<0.01), but
showed no significant differences in tumorigenicity compared to isotype control antibodytreatment at later time points (Fig.5A), consistent with previous studies (Peng et al., 2012;
Woo et al., 2012). However, we found that antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade significantly
(P<0.05) inhibited B16-F10 melanoma growth in PD-1(−/−) KO C57BL/6 mice compared
to controls, for the entire duration of the experiment (Fig.5B). Immunohistochemical
examination of melanoma grafts harvested at the experimental endpoint revealed >5-fold
increased binding (P<0.05) of in vivo-administered anti-PD-1 antibody to B16 melanoma
target tissue in PD-1(−/−) KO (Fig.5B) compared to wildtype C57BL/6 hosts (Fig.5A),
supporting the notion of a more pronounced PD-1 antibody effect on melanoma cells in
PD-1(−/−) KO mice. A >20% increase in PD-1 antibody titer in the serum of PD-1(−/−) KO
vs. PD-1(+/+) C57BL/6 hosts, as determined by rat-IgG2a-specific ELISA (Fig. S7A),
further indicated that increased PD-1 antibody availability might, at least in part, contribute
to the growth-inhibitory effect of PD-1 blockade in PD-1(−/−) KO hosts. Anti-PD-1
antibody administration to NSG mice also significantly (P<0.001) diminished B16-F10
melanoma growth compared to isotype control antibody treatment (Fig.5C). Interestingly,
while compared to B16 melanoma grafts grown in C57BL/6 mice, B16 melanomas grafted
to NSG mice tended to show increased anti-PD-1 antibody binding, antibody titers were not
increased in NSG mouse serum (Fig. S7A), suggesting strain-specific differences in PD-1
antibody kinetics. To control for the possibility that the observed growth-inhibitory effects
might result from antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1-expressing innate immune cell
subtypes present in NSG mice, we administered anti-PD-1 antibody to NK cell-,
macrophage-, and neutrophil-depleted NSG recipients of B16-F10 melanoma cells (Fig.
S7B). We also generated NSG mice depleted of all three innate immune effector subsets.
Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment inhibited B16 melanoma growth compared to isotype control
antibody in all innate immune cell-depleted NSG hosts (Fig. S7C).

Author Manuscript

To further confirm melanoma-specific PD-1 inhibition of the PD-1 blocking antibody, we
administered anti-PD-1 antibody to C57BL/6 and NSG mice grafted with Pdcd1-OE vs.
vector control B16-F10 melanoma cells. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment reversed the increase
in tumor growth of isotype control-treated Pdcd1-OE compared to vector-control B16
melanomas in both C57BL/6 (Fig.5D) and NSG mice, concomitant with binding of in vivoadministered anti-PD-1 antibody to B16 melanomas (Fig.5E), thereby confirming
recognition of melanoma-PD-1 by the PD-1 blocking antibody. Antibody-mediated PD-1
blockade also reduced three-dimensional B16-F0 and B16-F10 melanoma growth in vitro
(Fig.5F), but did not induce significant cell death compared to isotype control antibodytreatment (Fig.5G). Moreover, treatment of B16 melanoma cultures with anti-PD-1 but not
isotype control antibody inhibited phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig.5H).
Together, these findings show that antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade directly on melanoma
cells inhibits tumor cell-intrinsic, protumorigenic PD-1 functions, including in the absence
of adaptive immunity.

Antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade inhibits human melanoma xenograft growth in
immunodeficient mice

Author Manuscript

We next examined whether antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade can also inhibit human
melanoma growth in NSG mice. To assess the translational relevance of targeting melanoma
cell-intrinsic PD-1 to impede tumor growth, we first administered anti-PD-1 antibody to
NSG mice grafted with patient-derived melanoma cells. Consistent with our findings in
murine B16 models (Fig.5C), in vivo anti-PD-1 antibody administration to NSG mice
significantly inhibited mean tumor volumes of clinical melanoma xenografts derived from
three distinct melanoma patients (Fig.6A). Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment also significantly
inhibited the growth of human A375, C8161, and G3361 melanoma xenografts in NSG mice
compared to that of the respective control antibody-treated melanomas (Fig.6B).
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed binding of in vivo-administered anti-human PD-1
antibody to melanoma xenografts (Fig.6C). Administration of anti-PD-1 antibody to NSG
mice also abrogated the increased melanoma xenograft growth of isotype control-treated
human PDCD1-OE compared to vector-control C8161 xenografts (Fig.6D). Marked
melanoma binding of in vivo-administered anti-PD-1 antibody to PDCD1-OE C8161
melanomas (Fig.6D) further confirmed melanoma-PD-1 reactivity of the human anti-PD-1
blocking antibody. Compared to isotype control antibody-treatment, PD-1 blockade also
decreased three-dimensional melanoma growth in vitro (Fig.6E), but did not significantly
induce apoptosis in human A375, C8161, or G3361 melanoma cultures (Fig.6F). Finally,
treatment of G3361 melanoma cells with anti-PD-1 but not isotype control antibody
inhibited PD-L1 Ig-dependent phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig.6G). Together,
our findings in NSG mice indicate that anti-PD-1-mediated melanoma growth inhibition
results from direct interference with melanoma-expressed PD-1 and is not necessarily
dependent on adaptive immunity.

Melanoma cell expression of the PD-1 effector molecule, p-S6, correlates with response to
PD-1 therapy in cancer patients

Author Manuscript

To further assess the translational relevance of melanoma cell-intrinsic PD-1 receptor
signaling, we performed p-S6 staining and quantitatively assessed melanoma-p-S6 positivity
in pre-treatment vs. post-treatment tumor biopsies obtained from n=11 melanoma patients
undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy. We found that melanoma biospecimens sampled post PD-1
therapy demonstrated significantly (P=0.005) decreased p-S6 expression compared to
patient-matched pre-treatment biopsies (Fig.7A), consistent with our findings in PD-1
antibody-treated melanoma cell lines (Figs.5H,6G). Additionally, in a cohort of n=34
melanoma patients where pre-treatment tumor tissue was available for analysis, we found
that patients with high p-S6 expression (>25% of melanoma cells, Fig.7B) prior to treatment
showed a >3-fold increase in progression-free survival (mean progression-free survival: 17.0
vs. 4.5 months, P=0.001, Fig.7C) and significantly (P<0.05) enhanced overall survival
(mean overall survival: 25.1 vs. 13.0 months, Fig.7D) compared to melanoma patients with
low p-S6 levels (<25% of melanoma cells, Fig.7B) in pre-treatment tumor biospecimens
(Table S2). These findings suggest a relationship between p-S6 and response to PD-1
pathway blockade, thereby indicating the potential translational relevance of melanoma cellintrinsic PD-1 receptor functions.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Our study provides several insights into PD-1 pathway functions in melanoma. First, we
have conducted a comprehensive characterization of PD-1 transcript and protein expression
by cancer cells in clinical tumor biopsies and established melanoma lines. Until now, PD-1
expression has been mainly reported in immune-competent cells of the hematopoietic
lineage (Topalian et al., 2012a). We found that both melanoma cell lines and surgical
specimens frequently harbor PD-1-expressing cancer cells. However, PD-1 is not uniformly
present on all melanoma cells among heterogeneous tumor samples. Rather, it is restricted to
small melanoma subpopulations that are nonetheless critically important for tumor growth,
consistent with our previous findings demonstrating preferential PD-1 expression by
melanoma-initiating cells (Schatton et al., 2010). In our current study, RT-PCR,
immunoblot, and flow cytometric analyses revealed PD-1 on melanoma cells in all cell lines
and clinical tumor samples examined. Furthermore, immunofluorescence double labeling
similarly showed PD-1 expression by melanoma subpopulations in clinical biopsy
specimens obtained from >60% of melanoma patients. Thus, using various independent
methods, our work clearly establishes that melanomas frequently contain PD-1+ tumor cell
fractions. Comparably, melanoma cell expression of the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1, is often
confined to small subsets of cancer cells within clinical tumor specimens (Herbst et al.,
2014; Topalian et al., 2012b).

Author Manuscript

Second, this study demonstrates PD-1 receptor signaling in a non-immune cell type, i.e.
melanoma cells. To date, PD-1 immunobiology has been mainly studied in T-cells (Topalian
et al., 2012a). Binding of T-cell-expressed PD-1 to its ligands mediates inhibitory signals
that downmodulate T-effector functions. For example, in the cancer context, PD-1
expression by tumor-reactive CTLs results in their exhaustion or functional impairment
(Fourcade et al., 2010; Sakuishi et al., 2010), which represents a key mechanism underlying
tumor immune evasion (Pardoll, 2012). Similar to the protumorigenic effects of T-cellexpressed PD-1, our findings establish PD-1 expressed by melanoma cells as a tumor
growth-promoting mechanism in multiple independent experimental in vitro and in vivo
systems. However, while T-cell-PD-1 promotes cancer progression by dampening antitumor
immune responses, melanoma-PD-1 promotes tumor growth, even in the absence of a
functional adaptive immune system.

Author Manuscript

Our results further indicate that efficient, PD-1-driven tumorigenesis requires melanomaPD-1 interactions with host- and/or melanoma-expressed PD-L1, because both PD-L1deficient and PD-L1 antibody-treated mice grafted with Pdcd1-OE melanomas demonstrate
decreased tumor growth compared to respective controls. Additionally, PD-L1 (Pdcd1lg1)
silencing reversed melanoma-PD-1-driven tumorigenesis and recombinant PD-L1 Ig
treatment promoted melanoma spheroid growth. PD-L1 expression by melanoma cells has
established roles in tumor immune evasion (Dong et al., 2002). Beyond promoting cancer
progression by engaging with TIL-expressed PD-1, our study indicates that melanomaexpressed PD-L1 may also promote tumor growth via paracrine or autocrine interactions
with the melanoma-PD-1 receptor.

In T-cells, PD-1 engagement by its ligands modulates signaling networks downstream of the
TCR, including mTOR and PI3K/AKT (Riley, 2009). Consistent with the interrelationship
of PD-1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in T-cells, the important role of these pathways in
melanoma proliferation (Flaherty et al., 2012), and the herein described protumorigenic
effects of melanoma-PD-1, we found that PDCD1-KD, antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade,
and mutagenesis of melanoma-PD-1 signaling motifs decreased, while PDCD1-OE and PDL1 Ig-treatment increased phosphorylation of the mTOR effector molecule (Corcoran et al.,
2013), ribosomal protein S6. Melanoma-PD-1-dependent S6 phosphorylation was reversed
via pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR but not PI3K, suggesting that the PD-1 receptor on
melanoma cells activates downstream mTOR signaling through a PI3K/AKT-independent
pathway. However, whereas PD-1 activation augments p-S6 levels in melanoma cells and
enhances tumor growth, it dampens mTOR signaling in T-cells, leading to diminished
proliferation (Riley, 2009). Because S6 phosphorylation represents a point of convergence
that integrates multiple upstream signaling networks (Corcoran et al., 2013; Flaherty et al.,
2012) it is possible that melanoma-PD-1 might also modulate several alternative signaling
networks, in addition to the mTOR pathway.

Author Manuscript

PD-1 ligation in T-lymphocytes is known to recruit phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to its
ITIM and ITSM cytosolic loci, which induces dephosphorylation of proximal TCR signaling
intermediaries and subsequent suppression of several pathways downstream of the TCR,
including mTOR (Riley, 2009). SHP-2 is also expressed by melanoma cells (Ostman et al.,
2006) and tumor-initiating cell subsets in other cancers (Aceto et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2011),
paralleling our previous findings of preferential PD-1 expression by melanoma-initiating
cells (Schatton et al., 2010). In cancer cells, SHP-2-dependent signaling promotes activation
of protumorigenic pathways, including mTOR (Liu et al., 2011; Ostman et al., 2006). The
divergent effects of PD-1 ligation on mTOR signaling in melanoma cells vs. T-cells are thus
entirely consistent with the opposing, protumorigenic vs. growth-inhibitory roles of SHP-2
in the respective tissues.

Author Manuscript

Finally, our work reveals that PD-1 pathway interference exerts tumor growth-inhibitory
effects, not only in mice with fully intact immunity, but also in melanoma cultures devoid of
immune cells and in severely immunocompromised, T-cell-, B-cell-, and innate immune
cell-deficient hosts. Together, these results show that antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1
at the level of the melanoma cell inhibits tumor growth. Because PD-1 pathway inhibitors
have produced unprecedented response rates in otherwise treatment-refractory patients with
advanced cancers, including malignant melanoma (Hamid et al., 2013; Herbst et al., 2014;
Topalian et al., 2012b; Weber et al., 2015; Wolchok et al., 2013), our findings are of
potential translational importance. It has been well established that PD-1 blockade reverses
cancer antigen-specific T-cell exhaustion, thereby restoring antitumor immunity (Fourcade
et al., 2010; Sakuishi et al., 2010). Nevertheless, our data suggest that blockade of PD-1
directly on melanoma cells might represent an important additional, tumor cell-intrinsic
mechanism that could contribute to the clinical effectiveness of PD-1 cancer therapy. In
support of this possibility, our data obtained in a small cohort of patients with stage IV
melanoma suggests that tumoral expression of the PD-1 receptor signaling mediator, p-S6,
appears to correlate with response to anti-PD-1 antibodies. However, the possible utility of

p-S6 as a potential biomarker of PD-1 inhibitor sensitivity will require independent
validation in larger patient cohorts, including prospective cohort studies.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with our findings of protumorigenic effects of the melanoma-PD-1:PD-L1 axis,
clinical trial data suggest a correlation between melanoma-PD-L1 and TIL-PD-L1
expression and objective response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade (Herbst et al., 2014;
Topalian et al., 2012b; Tumeh et al., 2014). Interestingly, both elevated PD-L1 (Jiang et al.,
2013) and p-S6 expression levels (Corcoran et al., 2013) have evolved as potential
biomarkers of resistance to melanoma therapies targeting oncogenic BRAF mutations.
Therefore, our data suggest that combination of therapies targeting the MAPK pathway
(Flaherty et al., 2012) with PD-1 inhibitors may be effective, not only because they activate
tumor-specific immunity while concurrently blocking the MAPK oncogenic pathway, but
also because PD-1/PD-L1 blockade might additionally suppress mTOR-associated
protumorigenic signals. Furthermore, in light of our findings, the superior clinical activity
and safety profile of anti-PD-1- compared to anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Hamid et al., 2013;
Pardoll, 2012; Postow et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015) might, at least in part, relate to the
fact that the latter merely interferes with T-cell function, whereas PD-1 antibody treatment
may also directly target other PD-1-expressing immune cell types (Topalian et al., 2012a) or
the tumor itself, as suggested by our data. Finally, robust clinical response to anti-PD-1
therapy in patients with cancers that have hitherto not typically responded to immunotherapy
(Herbst et al., 2014; Topalian et al., 2012b) could at least be partially explained by direct
PD-1 inhibition on tumor cells in the respective malignancies.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our findings identify PD-1 expressed by melanoma cells as a tumor growth
receptor and molecular mediator of melanoma cell-intrinsic mTOR signaling, serving to
promote tumorigenesis in addition to its protumorigenic role when expressed by immune
cells. Recognition of melanoma-PD-1 receptor-driven tumorigenesis critically enhances our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying melanoma progression and could contribute to
the further refinement of PD-1-targeted therapies, for improved outcomes in patient with
advanced stage cancer.

RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Full-length PDCD1 was amplified and sequenced following reverse transcription of total
mRNA using PDCD1-specific primer pairs. Relative PDCD1, PDCD1LG1 (CD274) and
PDCD1LG2 (CD273) transcript levels were determined by real-time qRT-PCR and
calculated using the 2(−∆∆Ct) method (Schatton et al., 2008; Schatton et al., 2010). PD-1
surface protein expression by established melanoma lines and patient-derived melanoma
single cell suspensions was analyzed by flow cytometry (Schatton et al., 2008; Schatton et
al., 2010).
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed, total protein separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to a PVDF
membrane by electroblotting (Posch et al., 2013). Expression levels of human and murine
PD-1, and of phosphorylated vs. total ERK1/2, AKT and S6 proteins were determined using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Posch et al., 2013) or the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LICOR Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining
Immunofluorescence double-labeling for PD-1, MART-1 and/or CD45, and
immunohistochemical analysis of PD-1 expression in experimental tumors and of p-S6
expression in tumor biospecimens obtained from melanoma patients undergoing anti-PD-1
antibody therapy were carried out as described (Schatton et al., 2008; Schatton et al., 2010).
p-S6 immunoreactivity by melanoma cells was graded by three independent investigators
blinded to the study outcome on a scale of 0–4 (0: no p-S6 expression by melanoma cells; 1:
p-S6 expression in 1–25%; 2: 26–50%; 3: 51–75%; 4: >75% of melanoma cells).

Generation of stable PD-1 or PD-L1 knockdown and PD-1-overexpressing melanoma cell
line variants
Stable PD-1 or PD-L1 knockdown melanoma lines were generated using lentiviral
transduction particles containing shRNAs against human PDCD1, murine Pdcd1, or murine
Pdcd1lg1 (Cd274), and PD-1-overexpressing melanoma lines by infection with viral
particles containing the full length murine Pdcd1 or human PDCD1 CDS. PDCD1-OE
melanoma variants containing tyrosine to phenylalanine single-point mutations within PD-1
signaling motifs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis followed by enforced
expression, as above.
Three-dimensional melanoma culture

Author Manuscript

Melanoma tumor sphere cultures of native or melanoma-PD-1 variant lines were
maintained, as described (Aceto et al., 2012; Civenni et al., 2011), in standard culture
medium, as above, in the presence or absence of anti-PD-1 or isotype control mAb,
recombinant PD-L1 Ig or control Ig.
Murine melanoma induction and human melanoma xenotransplantation
C57BL/6, PD-1(−/−) KO C57BL/6, NSG, Rag(−/−), and PD-L1(−/−) KO Rag(−/−) mice
(Francisco et al., 2009) were maintained and experiments performed in accordance with

IACUC approved experimental protocols. For tumorigenicity studies, melanoma cells were
injected subcutaneously into flanks of recipient mice (Schatton et al., 2008). For PD-1 and
PD-L1 targeting experiments melanoma cells were grafted, mice intraperitoneally injected
with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or isotype control mAbs (200μg, respectively) every other day
starting one day before melanoma inoculation, and tumor formation/growth assessed as
described (Schatton et al., 2008).
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Gene and protein expression levels, tumor spheroid and in vivo melanoma growth were
compared statistically using the unpaired Student’s t test, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
test (comparison of two experimental groups) or repeated measures two-way ANOVA
followed by the Bonferroni correction (comparison of three or more experimental groups).
Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test were used to analyze statistical differences in
progression-free and overall survival between melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1
antibody therapy, whose pre-treatment tumor biopsies showed low vs. high melanoma cell
expression of p-S6. Differences in p-S6 expression in patient-matched tumor biospecimens
obtained before and after PD-1 therapy were statistically compared using the paired
Student’s t test. Data was tested for normal distribution using the D'Agostino and Pearson
omnibus normality test. A two-sided value of P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

(A) Expression of phospho (p)-S6 ribosomal protein by melanoma cells in tumor
biospecimens obtained from n=11 patients with stage IV melanoma before treatment start
compared to that in patient-matched progressive lesions sampled after initiation of anti-PD-1
antibody therapy. p-S6 expression by melanoma cells was determined by
immunohistochemical analysis and graded by three independent investigators blinded to the
study outcome on a scale of 0–4 (0: no p-S6 expression by melanoma cells; 1: p-S6
expression in 1–25%; 2: 26–50%; 3: 51–75%; 4: >75% of melanoma cells). (B)
