ABSTRACT
This study identifies BNIP3L as the key regulator of p53-dependent cell death
mechanism in colon cancer cells targeted by the novel gallium based anticancer
drug, KP46. KP46 specifically accumulated into mitochondria where it caused
p53-dependent morphological and functional damage impairing mitochondrial
dynamics and bioenergetics. Furthermore, competing with iron for cellular uptake,
KP46 lowered the intracellular labile iron pools and intracellular heme. Accordingly,
p53 accumulated in the nucleus where it activated its transcriptional target BNIP3L,
a BH3 only domain protein with functions in apoptosis and mitophagy. Upregulated
BNIP3L sensitized the mitochondrial permeability transition and strongly induced
PARKIN-mediated mitochondrial clearance and cellular vacuolization. Downregulation
of BNIP3L entirely rescued cell viability caused by exposure of KP46 for 24 hours,
confirming that early induced cell death was regulated by BNIP3L. Altogether,
targeting BNIP3L in wild-type p53 colon cancer cells is a novel anticancer strategy
activating iron depletion signaling and the mitophagy-related cell death pathway.

INTRODUCTION

pools (LIP) within the cytosol and other organelles [6].
While not yet proven if KP46 interferes with intracellular
iron homeostasis, KP46 was reported to increase the
intracellular [Ca2+] and mediate Ca2+ signaling in p53
dependent and independent apoptosis [7].
Given that TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene
in human cancer [8] we sought to understand the impact of
p53 in the cytotoxic mechanism of KP46. Using an in vitro
colon cancer cell system with p53 wild-type (HCT116WT),
we present the chronologic events induced by KP46. We
identify for the first time the mitochondrial accumulation
site of KP46, analyse how KP46 competes with iron and
the consequences thereof in respect to the expression of
p53 and p53 targets. Highlighting the functions of p53
associated with cell death, we identified the p53-dependent
molecular mechanism involved in PARKIN- and BNIP3Ldependent mitophagy, mitochondrial permeability

The recently developed gallium-based anticancer
drug tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) KP46 displays
efficient chemotherapeutic activity in vitro, has reached
clinical evaluation and was successfully tested in a phase
I study [1–3]. Though heading toward clinical phase II
trials, KP46 activates a variety of complex mechanisms
and pathways, converging on cell death of malignant cells
in a unique mode that still remains to be elucidated.
Based on the idea that gallium salts may compete
with ferric iron [4], impairment of iron dependent
cellular pathways and enzymes causing DNA damage
and cell cycle arrest was proposed as an anticancer
mechanism of gallium-derived drugs [5]. Fe(III) taken

to control cells (Figure 1c). The swollen and cristae-poor
appearance of mitochondria was persistent and increased
in a time dependent manner (Figure 1d–1e) as compared
to control cells (Figure 1f). As visualised by confocal
microscopy, KP46 disrupted the mitochondrial network
and its intracellular distribution (Figure 1j). Interestingly,
the perinuclear distribution of the mitochondrial network
was dependent on p53, since it was not depicted in
HCT116 cells lacking p53 (HCT116p53KO) (Figure 1o).
We also observed under KP46 conditions the punctuated

displayed swollen mitochondria with considerably

immunofluorescence of LC3-II, a marker of autophagy
(Figure 1j). In contrast to control cells (Figure 1g), the
punctuate fluorescence of LC3-II under KP46 increased
similarly as under starvation (Figure 1i and 1n) and
accumulated in presence of KP46 and chloroquine
(Figure 1k and 1p), an agent that blocks endosomal
acidification. Interestingly the fluorescence of LC3-II
and MitoTracker Red (MTR) colocalised in HCT116WT
exposed to KP46 and chloroquine (Figure 1k). Having
determined that KP46 targets mitochondria, we assessed
the accumulation site of KP46. Taking advantage of
the auto-fluorescence of KP46 [9], live imaging of
drug treated HCT116WT cells transiently expressing a
mitochondrial targeted red fluorescent protein (mtRFP)
showed the mitochondrial distribution of KP46
(Supplementary Figure S1).

mitochondrial mass after short term exposure to KP46.
In contrast, the mitochondrial protein levels remained
abundant and stably expressed in HCT116p53KO under
the same KP46 conditions, indicating that the KP46perturbated mitochondrial protein homeostasis was p53
dependent (Figure 3a).

KP46 decreases the mitochondrial mass
We asked if KP46-induced early mitochondrial
functional/morphological damage and the up-regulation
of LC3-II commit impaired mitochondria to removal by
autophagy. We quantified the mitochondrial content of
HCT116 cells exposed to 2.5 µM KP46 or vehicle for
6 hours, or 50 µM CCCP which induces the autophagic
degradation of depolarized mitochondria. Mitochondria
labelled with Nonyl acridine orange (NAO) dye
(which has previously been used to monitor changes
of mitochondrial mass) [11], were monitored by flow
cytometry and revealed a KP46-dependent decrease in
fluorescence intensity indicative of reduced mitochondrial
mass as compared to the controls (Figure 3c).
Having shown that KP46 did not decreased the ∆ψm, we
can exclude reduced fluorescence intensities of NAO in
function of the ∆ψm.

KP46 induces metabolic insufficiency
To determine if KP46 affects mitochondrial
functionality, mitochondrial respiration was measured
after short exposure to KP46 or control. Basal respiration
and ATP turnover were significantly reduced after 2 hours
(Figure 2a). Consistent with these data, the oxygen
consumption rates (OCR) were notably decreased
upon cell exposure to KP46 after 10 hours (Figure 2b).
Moreover, HCT116WT cells treated with KP46 for 4 or
6 hours displayed steadily decreasing OCR over 10 hours
post drug exposure (Supplementary Figure S2a–S2b).
The simultaneously monitored extracellular acidification
rates revealed diminished glycolysis (Supplementary
Figure S2c–S2d). To determine if the reduced OCR rates
resulted from decreased mitochondrial proteins, nutrient
demand or KP46-induced respiratory defects, the carbonyl
cyanide-4-(trifluomethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)
induced non-coupled respiration [10] was measured
and found to be compromised in KP46 exposed cells as
compared to control cells (Figure 2c). Simultaneously, the
mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm) was monitored.
We found that KP46 exposure did not depolarise the
mitochondrial membranes (Figure 2d). We concluded that
KP46 impaired energy metabolism in a general way and
independently of the mitochondrial protein content, ∆ψm
or nutrient demand.

KP46 drives accumulation of p53 in the nucleus
As previously shown for MCF-7 cells [7], KP46
also induced the p53 expression in HCT116WT cells (see
Figure 5a–5c). Performing time course microscopy,
we observed p53 immunofluorescence gradually
increasing after 2 hours and peaking between 12 and
24 hours KP46 exposure (Figure 4). Remarkably, KP46
treated cells displayed an increasing bright staining
of p53 exclusively in the nucleus, while the cytosolic
staining remained sparse (Figure 4). In contrast, under
control conditions, p53 was expressed at sparse basal
rate throughout the cytosol and nucleus. Immunoblots
confirmed the early KP46-dependent increase of p53 as
compared to control cells (Figure 5a–5b). We asked if
increased levels of p53 within the nucleus resulted from
upregulated transcription, decreased p53 export from
the nucleus or both. RT-PCR data confirmed the KP46induced transcriptional upregulation of p53 (Figure 5c).
As recently reported, the small molecule “specific and
potent autophagy inhibitor-1” (spautin-1), promotes
the turnover of p53 by blocking its deubiquitination via
inhibiting the deubiquitinating protease USP10 [12].
However, when co-treated with KP46 and spautin-1,
the p53 protein levels remained as abundant (data
not shown), suggesting that under KP46, p53 was not
exported from the nucleus for ubiquitin-dependent
degradation.

KP46 downregulates mitochondrial proteins
in a p53-dependent manner
We next investigated the mitochondrial protein
changes caused by KP46 and found decreased expression
of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC,
inner membrane proteins ND6 and COXIV while the
levels of the matrix heat shock chaperone HSP60 appeared
less affected (Figure 3a–3b). The data suggested reduced

KP46-caused intracellular iron and heme
deprivation induces accumulation of nuclear p53

nuclear p53, we asked if the uptake of KP46 was linked
to a depletion of Fe2+ pools and measured the changes in
the cellular labile iron pools (LIP) immediately elicited by
KP46 in HCT116WT cells. The LIP was significantly reduced
after 2 or 4 hours KP46 exposure as compared to control
cells (Figure 5d). To test whether KP46 reduced the LIP
because of competitive uptake with iron, we measured the
LIP upon addition of iron in presence or absence of KP46.
Addition of iron resulted in high levels of LIP, which were
significantly lowered when iron was added concomitantly

We asked if there was a crosstalk between
mitochondrial damage and p53 signal transduction. Recent
data revealed that iron depletion strongly upregulates
nuclear p53 [13]. Accordingly, we speculated that a decrease
of intracellular iron subsequent to KP46 uptake may trigger
the upregulation of nuclear p53. To confirm or exclude
a signaling role of intracellular [Fe2+] in the induction of

with KP46 (Figure 5e), underlining the notion of transferrin
mediated cellular uptake of KP46 [5]. Thus, depletion of
intracellular Fe2+ by KP46 was likely a cause of upregulated
nuclear p53. As well known, the rate of heme synthesis
depends on the intracellular status of Fe2+ [14]. Binding of
heme to nuclear p53 controls the export of p53 from the
nucleus for subsequent degradation [13]. Since the first
and last steps of heme synthesis occur in the mitochondria,
we asked if heme may function as a signaling molecule
between mitochondria and the nucleus and specifically
p53. We measured the intracellular heme content of cells
exposed to control or KP46 for 6 or 24 hours. While the
6 hours drug exposure did not alter the heme content,
significantly reduced levels were recorded after 24 hours
(Figure 5f) suggesting a progressive decrease between these
two time points.
Next, we tested if preloading HCT116 WT cells with
an excess of iron or heme would prevent the induction
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of p53 by KP46 and found that iron as well as hemin
saturation prior to KP46 exposure blunted the p53
upregulation (Figure 5g–5h). Altogether, we concluded
that iron depletion was an early event associated with p53
upregulation in the nucleus. Heme depletion appeared as a
secondary effect to iron deprivation, stabilising p53 in the
nucleus. Both events resulted in increased accumulation
of nuclear p53.

KP46 triggers PARKIN mediated mitophagy
As suggested by the findings on mitochondrial
defects and mass reduction, we analysed if mitophagy,
the selective mitochondrial autophagy was involved in
the cell death process. Exploring by western blotting the
expression of the general autophagy marker LC3-II, we
found low levels of LC3-I and LC3-II in control cells,
while KP46-exposed cells displayed as low levels of LC3-I

and markedly increased LC3-II, similarly to HCT116 cells
treated with the autophagy inducer rapamycin (Figure
6a–6b). Moreover, in contrast to BECLIN1, ATG7 was
significantly upregulated under KP46.
However, to specifically study mitophagy rather
than general autophagy we sought to study if PARKIN

was mobilised to mitochondria. PARKIN is a E3 ligase
promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins of
damaged mitochondria [15] and thus has been involved
in “priming” mitochondria for degradation [16]. Previous
studies in different cell lines have established carbonyl
cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) as a strong

inducer of PARKIN-mediated mitophagy by uncoupling
and depolarizing mitochondria [15, 17]. PARKIN is
constitutively expressed in the cytosol under normal
conditions and translocates to and targets mitochondria
for mitophagy under CCCP conditions [15]. To elucidate
if PARKIN recruits compromised mitochondria in
HCT116WT, cells co-transfected with PARKIN-EYFP and
mtRFP were exposed to CCCP. Live imaging confirmed
the recruitment of PARKIN to CCCP-damaged HCT116WT
mitochondria. In contrast to a diffuse cytoplasmic
distribution under basal conditions, PARKIN-EYFP
was detected as highly fluorescent punctae under CCCP
exposure (Figure 6c). Similarly to CCCP treatment, we
observed PARKIN-EYFP as highly fluorescent punctae
associated with and forming rings tightly surrounding
mitochondria under KP46 exposure (Figure 6c).
Consistently, immunoblots confirmed the upregulation
of PARKIN under KP46 to similar level as under
CCCP in comparison to control (Figure 6d–6e). General
ubiquitination of mitochondria was also confirmed by
western blotting (Figure 6f–6g). Furthermore, using
GFP-TAB2 NZF to visualise K63-polyubiquitin chains
[18], we found K63-polyubiquitinated mitochondria
(Supplementary Figure S3). The mitochondrial recruitment
of PARKIN was an early event as visualised after exposure
to KP46 for 2 or 4 hours.
To investigate if mitochondrial degradation
was counterbalanced by mitochondrial biogenesis,
the transcriptional level of the master regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis [19] PGC1α, was monitored.
As compared to control cells, the 4 hour exposure of
HCT116WT cells to KP46 significantly downregulated the
gene expression of PGC1α. Interestingly, PGC1α remained
unchanged in HCT116p53KO (Supplementary Figure S4).

BNIP3-like (BNIP3L) (Figure 7b–7c). Consistent with
the notion of KP46-induced p53 signaling, BNIP3L
protein and mRNA levels were not upregulated in isogenic
HCT116 p53KO cells treated with KP46 (Figure 7b–7d).
Moreover, induction of BNIP3L was also observed
at the transcriptional level in HCT116WT while not in
HCT116p53KO (Figure 7d).
We further addressed the role of BNIP3L in
activating PARKIN in response to KP46. Similar to prior
experiments (Figure 6c), we monitored the fluorescence
of PARKIN-EYFP upon CCCP in stably downregulated
BNIP3L (BNIP3LKD) cells (Figure 7a right panel).
The addition of CCCP resulted in heavy mitochondrial
fragmentation and activation of PARKIN (Figure 7a).
However, PARKIN-EYFP was found at a discrete
localization from mitochondria. In contrast, KP46 did
not activate PARKIN in BNIP3LKD cells, as indicated
by low intensity diffused fluorescence of PARKINEYFP throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 7a). In line with
these results, PARKIN transcripts were robustly induced
upon short exposure of HCT116WT cells to KP46 but
not in BNIP3LKD cells (Figure 7e) suggesting that KP46
upregulated PARKIN in function of BNIP3L. These
data support the idea that BNIP3L was involved in the
KP46-caused mitochondrial perturbations, which were
responsible for the induction of mitophagy.

KP46-caused mitophagy is not triggered by
mitochondrial depolarisation or reactive oxygen
species (ROS)
To study the BNIP3L caused damage to KP46
treated cells we considered decreased ∆ψm, which has
been the major factor described in signaling mitophagy.
However, as previously shown in Figure 2d (and
Supplementary Figure S5a), KP46 did not decrease ∆ψm
within short exposures up to 24 hours, while depolarisation
was observed after later time points (Supplementary
Figure S5a). Another well documented mitophagy inducer
is mitochondrial ROS [21]. Surprisingly, KP46-treated
cells did not display any significant superoxide formation
at early time points. In contrast, significant superoxide
formation was visible after 48 hours and later time points
(Supplementary Figure S5b–S5c).

KP46-induced mitophagy is specifically controlled
by p53 and BNIP3L
To then clarify if PARKIN activation was dependent
on p53, we first exposed HCT116 p53KO cells transiently
expressing PARKIN-EYFP and mtRFP to CCCP. The
bright staining of PARKIN-EYFP associated with the
fluorescence of mtRFP, confirming that CCCP-induced
PARKIN was independent of p53 (Figure 7a left panel).
Next, we tested if PARKIN was activated by KP46 in
absence of p53. In contrast to CCCP-induced mitophagy,
PARKIN-EYFP was not recruited to KP46 exposed p53KO
mitochondria (Figure 7a). Thus, our data clearly illustrated
that p53 was essential for the KP46-mediated PARKIN
recruitment to mitochondria. This finding suggested that
KP46 triggered p53-caused mitochondrial dysfunctions,
which likely induced the mitophagic machinery.
We next asked if activated PARKIN was mediated
by nuclear p53 via its transcriptional target, BNIP3L
[20]. We found a marked early induction of the BH3only subfamily proteins BNIP3 and more prominently
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

KP46 sensitizes the Ca2+-dependent opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP)
We considered increased mitochondrial permeability
transition (MPT) as another potential trigger of mitophagy.
To investigate if KP46 affected the MPT, we performed
a Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) assay, which assesses
the maximum ability of mitochondria to accumulate
Ca2+ until MPT occurs. In contrast to control cells, the
threshold level of Ca2+ pulses necessary to induce MPT in
KP46-treated cells was considerably lowered as indicated

by the significantly decreased CRC (Figure 8a, 8e).
Interestingly, HCT116 p53KO cells did not display a
comparable sensitivity to the PTP opening (Supplementary
Figure S6). Confirming that the KP46-sensitized PTP
was not caused by ROS formation, co-treatment with
the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) did not
prevent the rapid PTP opening (Figure 8b–8c, 8e). Also
cyclosporine A (CsA), a known inhibitor of the pore
regulator Cyclophilin-D (CyP-D) had no protective effect
(Figure 8b–8c, 8e). However, we found that the addition of
thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the SERCA pumps, prevented
to some extent the KP46-induced shortening of the CRC
(Figure 8b–8c, 8e). These results suggested that KP46
sensitized HCT116WT to the PTP opening in dependence
of ER Ca2+ stores.

assays were performed (Supplementary Figure S7b).
As shown in Figure 9g–9h, interference of BNIP3L or
ATG7 (as shown in Figure 6a–6b significantly increase
under KP46) partly protected KP46-exposed HCT116
cells from cell death.
Altogether, the data presented here propose a
cytotoxic mechanism of KP46 consisting of targeting
an early autophagic cell death type reinforced by a late
caspase-dependent cell death pathway, leaving the
possibility open that caspase-dependent cell death affects
cells escaping mitochondrial clearance.

Ca2+-induced PTP sensitivity to KP46 is controlled
by BNIP3L

Concurrently with mitochondrial changes, we
detected continuously rising p53 levels as an early
response to KP46. p53 did not translocate to mitochondria
but consistently remained within the nuclei. Intrigued by
the link between the mitochondrial targeting of KP46
and the p53 response, we speculated that there was a
correlation between altered iron content and the nuclear
p53 expression, as gallium uptake competes with iron, and
iron depletion upregulates and iron excess downregulates
p53 in the nucleus [13]. Consistent with this idea, we
report here that the intracellular uptake of KP46 was
accompanied by intracellular iron depletion, which
remarkably coincided with p53 activation.
Importantly, p53 binding to heme is required
for the export of p53 from the nucleus into the cytosol,
where degradation of ubiquitinated p53 takes place [13].
Since mitochondria are major sinks of iron, which they
utilize for the biosynthesis of heme and Fe-S clusters
[24], heme pools also decrease under iron depletion [13].
Supporting this notion, we found significantly decreased
heme content in cells exposed to KP46 as compared to
control cells. Corroborating the regulatory role of iron
and heme on p53 expression, preloading the cells with
iron or hemin prevented the increase of nuclear levels of
p53 in KP46-exposed HCT116WT. In conclusion, iron and
heme depletion are key regulators of the transcriptional
expression and nuclear accumulation of p53 under KP46
treatment and furthermore act as the signaling factor
between mitochondria and p53.

DISCUSSION
KP46 links iron depletion and p53 induction

Based on the knowledge that BNIP3L regulates
the SERCA pumps [22], we next asked whether KP46
sensitized the PTP in function of BNIP3L and repeated
the CRC assays in BNIP3LKD cells. Importantly,
BNIP3LKD cells treated with KP46 displayed significantly
longer CRC as compared to KP46 treated HCT116WT
cells expressing a scramble shRNA (Figure 8d, 8f).
These results clearly pointed to the role of BNIP3L in
controlling the Ca2+-induced MPT of KP46 exposed
mitochondria.

KP46-induced loss of viability is partly reversed
by interference of mitophagy
In contrast to healthy control cells (HEK293T)
exposed to different doses of KP46, the cell viability
of HCT116WT was drastically reduced as shown in
Supplementary Figure S7a. Although the upregulation
of pro-apoptotic proteins was an early KP46-activated
p53 response [23], longer exposure to KP46 was
necessary to induce late apoptotic features as indicated
by the percentage of Annexin V (~28,52 %) or
Annexin V-7AAD double positive cells (~17,58 %)
(Figure 9a). Similarly, caspase-3 cleavage, a general
indicator of apoptotic cell death, was significantly
detected after 48 hours (Figure 9b). TEM micrographs
revealed a highly vacuolized morphology of cells
treated with KP46 for 48 hours displaying apoptotic
nuclei, condensed nucleoli and features of secondary
necrosis (Figure 9c), which were not observed for
shorter KP46 exposures. Having demonstrated that
interference of BNIP3L blunted mitophagy (Figure
7a) we asked if it would also alter the cell viability.
Indeed cell viability was entirely restored after 24 hours
as shown by MTT assays (Figure 9d). To investigate
longer interference of mitophagy in KP46-induced cell
death, cells were treated for 48 hours and clonogenic

This is the first study that identifies mitochondria
as the intracellular accumulation sites of KP46. Since
mitochondria are important players in determining the
survival and cell death commitment of cancer cells, they
represent attractive targets of anticancer chemotherapy.
As reviewed elsewhere [25], the mostly targeted
mechanistic pathways converge on the rupture of the
mitochondrial outer membrane, the disintegration of the

permeability pore complex and thereby on apoptosis.
These mitochondrial cell death pathways are controlled
by p53 [26–31] at transcriptional and non-transcriptional
levels [26, 27]. Indeed, p53 can also promote apoptosis by
translocating from the nucleus to the mitochondrial surface
[32] and trigger the permeabilization of the mitochondrial
outer membrane by activating pro-apoptotic factors
[30, 33] or as recently reported by opening the PTP. p53
also may translocate to the cytoplasm and repress general
macroautophagy and mitophagy [26, 29]. However, in the
nucleus, p53 regulates the expression of an array of target
genes encoding most importantly Bcl-family proteins with
pro-apoptotic functions [20, 28, 34].
Here we identified BNIP3L as a major
transcriptional target of p53 in response to KP46. BNIP3L
belongs to the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 protein
family and is a multi-functional protein with critical
apoptotic and non-apoptotic (e.g. autophagic) cell death
related roles [20, 35]. BNIP3L acts as a mitochondrial
stress sensor regulating mitophagy [36], by disturbing the
BECLIN1-Bcl2/Bcl-X complex [37]; or triggers caspasedependent apoptosis through the permeabilization of the
mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, it regulates
the SR/ER Ca2+ pumps, thus increasing the ER Ca2+ stores
and the delivery of Ca2+ from the ER to the juxtaposed
mitochondria, eventually inducing programmed necrosis
through mitochondrial PTP opening [22, 37]. Consistent
with previously described functions, BNIP3L was crucial
for PARKIN-mediated mitophagy in the presence of
p53. Indeed, PARKIN was not induced or recruited
to KP46-exposed mitochondria in cells expressing
BNIP3L in the p53KO background or in cells with
reduced BNIP3L in the p53WT background, confirming
the essential role of BNIP3L in PARKIN signaling.
Interestingly, while BNIP3LKD impaired PARKINtranslocation to CCCP-treated mitochondria, BNIP3LKO
(Bnip3L–/–) MEFs entirely failed to mobilize PARKIN
under CCCP, underlining its crucial role on priming
defective mitochondria for PARKIN [16]. Finally, K63
ubiquitination of KP46-exposed HCT116WT mitochondria
underlined the KP46-induced mitophagy-signaling event.
What was the trigger for mitophagy? Our data
clearly excluded classical stimuli such as reduced ∆ψm
or ROS [38]. Of note, the serine/threonine-protein kinase
PINK1 which is required to activate PARKIN appeared
stabilized but not increased under KP46 treated HCT116
as compared to controls (data not shown). Interestingly,
iron depletion has recently emerged as a mitophagy signal,
however in a HIF1α-dependent and PARKIN-independent
context [39]. Another critical signal for mitophagy is
mitochondrial swelling as seen under Ca2+ overload
[40, 41]. Applying external Ca2+ pulses induced the opening
of the mitochondrial PTP, indicating that KP46 significantly
sensitized the MPT. Considering the mitochondria as
a delivery site for KP46, we propose that disturbed
mitochondrial ion homeostasis induce mitochondrial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

swelling and thereby mitophagy. Based on data presented
here, we may speculate that KP46 induced in a p53/
BNIP3L dependent manner the flickering of the PTP that
was not strong enough to cause an overall depolarization
but enough to signal the initiation of mitophagy and
mobilize the mitophagy players, especially PARKIN.
Based on previous evidence showing that BNIP3L
regulates the ER Ca2+ stores [42] and that KP46 increases
intracellular Ca2+ [7] we propose that upregulated BNIP3L
controls the MPT of KP46 treated cells by increasing the
transfer of ER Ca2+ to the mitochondria. Supporting this
idea, we show that thapsigargin, the inhibitor of the ER/
SERCA pumps partly prevented the Ca2+-induced opening
of the PTP while the antioxidant NAC did not. Similarly,
BNIP3L downregulation in KP46 treated cells repressed
the Ca2+-induced PTP opening. Taken together, consistent
with a role of BNIP3L in regulating the MPT [22, 43] and
mitophagy, we identified BNIP3L as the nuclear target of
p53-driven mitophagy [38], ER Ca2+ release and eventually
cell death upon KP46 exposure.
Remarkably, while PARKIN, BNIP3L and nuclear
p53 were upregulated, PGC1α was repressed. In general,
mitophagy functions as cell survival strategy by clearing
dysfunctional mitochondria. However, survival cannot be
sustained under disproportionate mitochondrial clearance
and reduced biogenesis. Consequently, mitophagy becomes
a cell death process requiring excessive formation of
autophagic organelles. Like the pro or anti survival roles of
mitophagy, the mechanistic modes of action of mitophagy
are intricate as well. Several mechanisms have been
described for p53 in negatively regulating mitophagy in
function of its intracellular localization under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions. Accordingly, while cytosolic p53 has
been shown to bind to PARKIN and repress mitophagy
[44, 45], translocation of p53 to mitochondria has been
reported to protect from mitochondrial dysfunctions and
thereby prevent mitophagy [46]. In line with a protective
role of mitophagy under stress conditions, very recently
it was shown that the accumulation of p53 in tumor cells
under hypoxia - by use p53 fused to the oxygen-dependent
degradation domain of HIF1α - inhibited PARKIN-mediated
mitophagy and thereby increased the radiosensitivity of
these tumor cells [47].
In conclusion, demonstrating a crucial role of the
p53 status in determining the cell death pathway, we
show a novel p53-dependent drug response where p53
accumulates in the nucleus to induce BNIP3L as a main
actor and mitophagy as chief factor regulating cell death.

Mitochondrial isolation
Mitochondrial isolation was performed according
to the protocol of Frezza C. and Scorrano L. [51].
Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer (IBc)
containing 1 mM Tris-MOPS, 0.1 mM EGTA/Tris, and
200 mM sucrose, pH 7.4, homogenized using a Potter
(overhead stirrer, OST basic, #3145000) at 1400 rpm and
centrifugated at 600 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant
was centrifugated at 7000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The
resulting pellet contains the mitochondrial fraction.

Viability assay
The cytotoxicity of KP46 was determined based on
a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) viability assay (EZ4U, Biomedica,
Vienna, Austria). HCT116WT cells shRNAscr or
shRNABNIP3L transfected cells were exposed to
vehicle or KP46 (10 µM). Untransfected HCT116WT
cells were exposed to vehicle or KP46 (10 µM) for 24.
After treatments, the media were removed and replaced
with 100 µL EZ4U-MTT assay solution (1:10 dilution

7 minutes, washed with 1x PBS, centrifuged as before and
fixed with 70% ethanol for 10 minutes. Then, cells were
washed once with 1x PBS and stained with 500 nM Nonyl
acridine orange (Acridine Orange 10-Nonyl Bromide,

flow cytometry measurements on Gallios flow cytometer
(Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).

Microscopy
Confocal microscopy
For immunofluorescence imaging, cells were
seeded onto cover slips in 24 wells plates or µ-Slide 8
well plates (ibidi# 80826). When required, mitochondria
were stained with MTR (50 nM). MTR was loaded for
the last 30 minutes of treatment and before fixation. Cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised
with Triton X, blocked with BSA, incubated with the
appropriate primary antibodies. Secondary antibody
was goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 488
(Invitrogen, #A00037). After staining the nucleus with
DAPI, coverslips were mounted on slides using mounting
solution (DakoCytomation #125046). Images were taken
with the microscope LSM700 using Plan-Apochromat
63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective lens with a pinhole
adjusted at 68 µm.
For mitophagy live imaging, cells seeded onto
µ-Slide 8 well plates (ibidi# 80826), were maintained
under CO2 at 37°C and visualised under the LSM780
microscope using Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC
M27 lens and pinhole 90 µm. Cell exposure for 2 hours to
CCCP (50 µM) served as positive control for mitophagy.

Flow cytometry analysis
To assess cell death, cells exposed to vehicle or KP46
(2.5 or 10 µM, as indicated) for 48 hours were pelleted,
washed with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM
NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4 and 2 mM KH2PO4),
centrifuged at 600 g for 7 minutes at 4°C and transferred into
FACS buffer (4% BSA in PBS). Then, cells were stained
with Annexin V PE and 7 AAD using the Annexin V:PE
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA,
USA #559763) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
washed and immediately analysed with the Gallios flow
cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). To measure
active Caspase 3, cells treated with vehicle or KP46 for 24
and 48 hours were resuspended in the fixing solution for
10 minutes at 4°C, washed and stored in the permeabilisation
solution for 15 minutes at 4°C (IntraPrep Fixation and
Permeabilization Reagent, Beckman Coulter, 07803).
Cells were incubated with the anti-active Caspase 3 rabbit
antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA #559565)
for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark, washed with PBS, and
incubated with the secondary FITC donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-096-152) for 30 minutes
at 4°C in the dark, then washed with PBS and analysed by
flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Cytomics FC500).
To determine the ∆ψm, cells exposed to vehicle
or KP46 (10 µM) for 2, 4, or 8 hours, were stained for
30 minutes with TMRM (100 nM). Exposure to
Valinomycin (200 nM) for 30 minutes at 37°C served to
generate depolarised controls. Cells were washed with
PBS, trypsinised and resuspended in fresh growth medium.
After two washing steps, the TMRM fluorescence intensity
was immediately visualized by Gallios flow cytometer
on FL2. Populations with polarised and depolarised
mitochondrial membrane potential indicated by TMRM
fluorescence intensity were quantified according to their
arithmetic mean value.

Electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy pellets of
HCT116 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4° overnight.
Postfixation was done in 1% OsO4 for 90 min, followed
by dehydration in ethanol and embedding in low viscosity
epoxy resin (Agar scientific, UK). Thin sections for

as described by [54]. The anti-calcein antibody was used to
quench fluorescence of extracellular calcein. Measurement
was performed at Ex485nm/Em535nm (measurement A)
in a fluorescence plate reader (Anthos Zenyth 3100, HVD
Vienna). Three minutes after addition of salicylaldehyde
isonicotinoyl hydrazine (SIH) (100 µM), a strong iron
chelator, the plate was measured again (measurement B).
The difference between measurement B and measurement
A represents the LIP. Shown is the total fluorescence
intensity. Exact concentrations could not be obtained
reliably because the cell-free calibration and the assessment
in the cellular system were apparently not exactly equal.

Oxygen consumption was measured in whole
cells using a Clark-type electrode (Rank Brothers,
Cambridge UK). In brief, HCT116WT cells were treated
with either vehicle or KP46 (2.5 µM) for 1, 2, 4, 6 h then
washed, trypsinized and counted, 4 x 106 cells were then
suspended in respiration medium (1 mM sodium pyruvate,
25 mM glucose, 2% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) and the
oxygen consumption was measured at 37°C. Uncoupled
respiration was determined by the addition of oligomycin
(1 µg/mL) after a stable basal rate was obtained, nonmitochondrial respiration was determined by the addition
of antimycin A (4 µM) and rotenone (5 µM). ATP turnover
was calculated by the subtraction of uncoupled respiration
from basal respiration rate.
The Seahorse XF analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,
Billerica, MA) was used to measure extracellular fluxes
in a XF24 or XFp well format. For XF24, HCT116WT cells
were seeded at a density of 40 000 cells per well in 100 µL
growth media with 4 empty control wells. On the day of
measurement, the media was changed to growth media
supplemented with either DMSO or KP46 (10 µM) for the
indicated length of time. After treatment, the cells were
washed with XF DMEM assay medium (25 mM glucose,
1 mM pyruvate, pH 7.4), 675 µL XF DMEM assay media
was then added and the cells incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a
CO2 free incubator before measurement. The experiments
were similarly conducted in the XFp instrument, with the
exception that cells were seeded at a density in 20 000 per
well in 50 µL. XF24 or XFp extracellular flux analyzer
measured oxygen consumption, FCCP (0.2 µM) or FCCP
(0.24 µM), oligomycin (1 µM), antimycin A (0.5 µM) and
rotenone (0.5 µM), respectively, were added at the time
as indicated. After measurement, when indicated, protein
content of all wells was determined by Bradford Assay
(Bio-Rad laboratories, Pty, Hercules, California, USA) and
used to normalize OCR readings.

Heme measurement
Heme content was measured fluorometrically
using the fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX as outlined
in [55] with minor modification. In brief, cells were
treated as indicated with DMSO or KP46, washed and
then harvested in 1% Triton X in PBS. Cellular debris
was removed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 minutes;
protein concentration of the supernatant was determined
by Bradford assay (Bio-RAD, Pty, Hercules, California,
USA). Lysates (100 µg protein) were boiled in 2 M oxalic
acid for 30 minutes. The samples were diluted in 2X
volume water and fluorescence was measured using a plate
reader at Ex405nm/Em600nm (TristarLB941, Berthold
Technologies). For each experiment a standard curve was
generated using hemin at concentrations ranging between
0–600 pmol.

Calcium retention capacity
The CRC assay was performed according to [56].
Briefly, 7x106 cells were trypsinised, resuspended and
centrifuged at 600 g for 7 min. at 4°C. The cell pellet
was washed in isotonic buffer IB (10 mM Tris/Mops,
1 mM Pi-Tris, 130 mM KCl and 0.1 mM EGTA/Tris,
pH 7.4) and permeabilized using digitonin (150 µM)
for 15 min, at 4°C in presence of 1 mM EGTA. Cells
were washed once in IB containing 0.1 mM EGTA
and resuspended in IB containing 10 µM EGTA in the
presence of Calcium-Green-5N (1 µM), cytochrome
C (10 µM) and succinate (5 mM) for fluorometric
measurements. Cells were exposed to Ca2+ spikes
(10 µM) and the Calcium-Green-5N fluorescence was
measured at 25°C with the fluorescence spectrometer
(Ex505 nm/Em535 nm) using LS50B (Perkin Elmer,
Waltham, MA).

Assessment of the labile iron pool (fluorescent
calcein-assay)
The labile iron pool (LIP) was assayed by the
fluorescence calcein-assay developed by Breuer et al. [52]
with modifications for adherent cells described by Sturm
et al. [53]. For the fluorescent calcein-assay, HCT116WT
cells, cultivated in McCoy’s 5A culture medium, were
incubated with KP46 (2.5 µM) for the indicated times and
then washed with culture medium without FBS containing
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (50 µM) and
twice in medium without FBS to remove surface bound
iron. Following loading the cells with calcein-AM (0.25
µM) in 20 mM Hepes buffered serum-free growth medium
for 15 minutes at 37°C and washings, they were incubated
with medium with anti-calcein antibody and 20 mM Hepes.
Anti-calcein antibody was prepared according to a protocol
of William Breuer (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel)
