ABSTRACT
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the most common malignancy of
the urinary tract, nearly half of which contains a mutation in TP53 gene. Hence,
therapeutic approach by restoring functional p53 protein in cancer cells will be
beneficial. Recent studies have demonstrated the inhibition of cancer cell growth by
p53 reactivation using a peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus (p53C). However,
the outcome of reactivating p53 in controlling bladder cancer development is limited
by its efficiency and specificity of peptide delivery, especially in metastatic animal
models. Herein, we report that the cell penetrating peptide (polyarginine, R11)conjugated p53C can exhibit a preferential uptake and growth inhibit of UCB cells
expressing either mutant or wild-type TP53 by the activation of p53-dependent
pathway. R11-p53C peptide treatment of preclinical orthotopic and metastatic bladder
cancer models significantly decreased the tumor burden and increased the lifespan
without a significant cytotoxicity. Based on these results, we believe that R11-p53C
peptide has therapeutic potential for primary and metastatic bladder cancer, and
R11-mediated transduction may be a useful strategy for the therapeutic delivery of
large tumor suppressor molecules to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

Restoration of wild-type (wt) p53 function is
known to induce inhibition of tumor growth through the
expression of downstream genes, such as WAF1/p21/
Cip1, Bax and Fas/APO-1, which play important roles in
arresting the cell cycle or inducing apoptosis [4]. Previous
studies have indicated that peptides derived from the
p53 C-terminus (p53C) can restore the specific DNA
sequences binding and transactivational function of mutant
p53, resulting in p53-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells
[5, 6]. However, these compounds are unable to cross the
cell membrane due to the lipophilic nature and effective
barrier of the biological membranes, which restricts the
intracellular delivery of macromolecules with non-polar
and larger than 500D in size [7].
Our previous study indicated that the cell
penetrating peptides (CPPs) poly(11)-arginine termed
R11 exhibited a higher uptake efficiency by different

INTRODUCTION
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the 9th
most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the most
common malignancy of the urinary tract [1]. Among the
initial diagnosis of bladder cancers, approximately one
third are diagnosed as invasive disease or have metastasis.
Epidemiological data demonstrated that more than 50%
of human malignancies, including bladder cancer, are
associated with the mutations of TP53 gene [2]. Mutant
p53 proteins not only fail to inhibit tumor growth, but
also accelerate tumorigenesis and are associated with
poor prognosis of patients and resistance to radiotherapy
or chemotherapy [3]. Thus, it is imperative to develop
new strategies, such as p53-specific molecular targeted
therapy, for achieving a better therapeutic efficacy for this
form of UCB.

UCB cell lines [8]. Moreover, in vivo evaluation of the
tissue distribution of R11 in nude mice showed that R11
exhibited an organ-specific uptake in bladder and prostate
tissues after intravenous delivery [9–11]. Thus, R11 could
be used as a potential delivery vehicle in UCB therapy.
In the present study, our results further indicated that
the synthetic peptide conjugated with R11 (R11-p53C)
was efficiently and preferentially delivered into bladder
cancer cells, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth
regardless of the status of p53. More interestingly, this
inhibition manifested as a high efficiency in both primary
and metastatic tumor models without a significant toxicity.

FITC-tagged p53C as the C-terminus separated by two
glycines was synthesized, and the uptake efficiency
was determined in UCB cells (i.e., T24) based on the
fluorescence intensity of FITC conjugated with each
peptide. A dose-dependent increase in fluorescence
intensity was observed in R11-p53C and R11-Con (R11GG-GSRAHSSHLESAEGQSTSRHKK-FITC) peptides;
in contrast, p53C (GSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKFITC) peptides had lower fluorescent intensity (Figure 1A).
To visualize the intracellular localization of the peptides,
fluorescence microscopy was applied in T24 cells after
treating with three peptides, and the data indicated
that majority of peptides were localized in the cytosol
(Figure 1B). Consistent with the uptake efficiency results,
R11-conjugated peptides exhibited a higher fluorescent
intensity than others in T24 cells.
Subsequently, we examined the ability of growth
inhibition induced by R11-p53C in T24 (mutant p53),
253J (wt p53) and SV-HUC (immortalized normal
human bladder epithelial cell, wt p53) using MTT assay.

p53 target genes, including p21, PUMA (p53-up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis), and GADD45A (growth arrest
and DNA damage-inducible 45a) but not PIG3 (p53
induced gene 3) (Figure 2B). These results indicate
that R11-p53C peptide can increase p53 transcriptional
function in UCB cells.
To further ascertain that R11-p53C exerts its effect
through p53-mediated pathways, we tested the effect of
pifithrin-α, a specific inhibitor of p53, on R11-p53C-induced
target gene expression and growth inhibition (31). The
expression of p21 and GADD45A protein was examined by
western blot in T24 cells treated with or without pifithrin-α.
Pifithrin-α significantly impaired the expression of p21 and
GADD45A, suggesting that its mechanism controlling the
expression of these genes is p53-dependent (Figure 2C).
As expected, pifithrin-α could also antagonize R11-p53Cmediated growth inhibition in T24 cells (Figure 2D).
Taken together, these data indicate that R11-p53C is able
to activate p53-dependent pathway and plays an important
role in growth inhibition of UCB cells.

Consistent with the recent report using p53 C-terminal
peptide in prostate cancer cells [12], we found that R11p53C inhibited cell proliferation in T24 cells (Figure 1C).
Interestingly, it also exhibited similar effect in 253J
cells regardless of the status of p53 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1D). In contrast, R11-p53C peptide did
not significantly affect the growth of SV-HUC cells
(Supplementary Figure S1).

Induction of p53 activities by R11-p53C peptide
Next, we also found that R11-p53C peptide could
induce a G1 cell cycle arrest in T24 cells (Figure 2A).
These results are consistent with a previous report that
certain cancer cells with p53 mutations are susceptible to
CPP-p53C peptide [13]. To further determine whether the
inhibitory effect by R11-p53C peptide in T24 cells was
dependent on p53 activities, we examined the expression
of several p53-regulated genes by qRT-PCR. In T24 cells,
R11-p53C peptide was able to induce the expression of

(Figure 3D), indicating the in vivo anticancer effects of
R11-p53C peptide is p53-dependent. These observations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the small peptide in
suppressing tumor growth and extending the survival of
animals bearing UCB in a p53-dependent manner.

In order to further show the specific uptake and
broaden the application of R11-p53C in the metastatic
tumors in vivo, we developed the lung metastatic animal
model by injecting T24-luc cells into the tail vein. The
lung metastasis model was observed by fluorescence
microscopy. As expected, fluorescence-labeled R11p53C and R11-Con. peptides could be readily detected
in metastatic tumor lesions but not normal lung tissue
(Figure  4A), indicating the tissue specificity of R11conjuncted peptides in UCB. Early indications of
metastasis were observed within 14 days after T24-luc cell
injection. The initial signals were confirmed by sequential
imaging (Figure 4B and 4C). Almost all lung metastatic
lesions showed a gradual decrease in BLI intensity over
time in R11-p53C treated group. Further, mice bearing
metastatic bladder cancer succumbed to tumor burden

Unique biodistribution of R11-conjuncted
peptides
From the in vivo evaluation of the tissue
distribution of three peptides (p53C, R11-Con. and R11p53C) in nude mice bearing T24 orthotopic tumor, we
also showed that R11-conjuncted peptides exhibited a
specific uptake in bladder or orthotopic bladder tumors
tissues 2 hrs after intraperitoneal injection, because
the peptide uptake was much lower in other organs
(Supplementary Figure S2).

when treated with DMSO, p53C or R11-Con., with a mean
survival time of 33 days, 28 days and 27 days after tumor
cell injection, respectively (Figure 4D). In contrast, R11p53C peptide treatment could significantly increase animal
survival rate, because 80% animal survived more than 60
days. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that
R11-p53C could significantly decrease metastatic tumor
burden and increase the overall survival.
Despite of these encouraging observations, R11p53C peptide-treated animals still have some tumor burden,
which could be due to the emergence of peptide resistant
tumor cells or insufficient drug dose. To distinguish these
possibilities, we isolated T24-luc cells recovered from
tumors after 4 weeks of peptide treatment. T24 cells treated
with R11-p53C peptide exhibited similar G1 cell cycle
arrest as parental cells (Supplementary Figure S3). This
observation rules out the possible acquisition of resistance
in T24 cells. Thus, more treatment schedule is expected in
order to achieve complete eradication of cancer cells.

number of red blood cells, white blood cells and the level
of C-reactive protein remained unchanged after 24 hrs of
treatment with peptide, indicating minimal inflammatory
responses toward these peptides [14]. Accordingly,
liver transaminase levels (i.e., ALT/AST) remained the
same in control-treated mice and R11-p53C-treated
mice after 72 hrs of treatment. In agreement with these
observations, serum creatinine level remained unaffected
among these groups (Figure 5B). An important parameter
for clinical application of in vivo delivery of R11-p53C
is to avoid triggering acute toxicity to the total body
weight [15]. Our data indicated that R11-p53C or its
control (R11-Con.) used for 3 days had no any adverse
effects on body weight of T24-injected mice (Figure 5C).
Furthermore, there was no significant decrease of the
spleen weights after 3 weeks of treatment with peptides
(Figure 5D). Together, these results indicate that the R11p53C peptide does not induce significant acute or chronic
hemolytic reaction.

In vivo toxicity of R11-p53C peptide

DISCUSSION

After confirming the potency of R11-p53C in
inhibiting UCB in vivo, we next sought to evaluate
whether this compound had adverse side effects in mice
when applied systematically. As shown in Figure 5A, the

needed. It’s known that the dysfunction of p53 has been
related to progression, prognosis and therapeutic response
of tumors [16]. These observations led to the hypothesis
that introduction of functional p53 protein will be a useful
means to treat UCB. In this study, we demonstrate that small
peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus can be effectively
delivered via R11-mediated transduction and specifically
modulate tumor biology in vitro and in vivo.
A number of studies have attempted to evaluate the
potential of p53-related proteins or peptides delivery in
cancer therapy. Although the efficient antitumor activity
of the compounds has been confirmed, their utility is
limited by some problems, such as cytotoxicity and lack
of systemic biodistribution to disseminated metastatic
sites [17]. In contrast, we observed that R11-conjuncted
peptides exhibited a specific and efficient uptake by
UCB cell lines and animal models without significantly
cytotoxic effects on normal tissues in this study.
Mechanistically, other laboratories have shown that
the growth inhibition of tumor cells by C-terminal p53derived peptide was directly correlated with levels of
mutant p53 without toxicity to normal or tumor cells with
wt p53 [12, 18, 19]. However, the present result showed
that the growth inhibition in bladder cancer induced by
R11-p53C was both in mutant and wt p53 while had no
significant effect on normal cells. Furthermore, we found
the transcription levels of several p53 target genes were
upregulated significantly after R11-p53C treatment.
However, the induction was abolished in the present of
pifithrin-α treatment. This provide us evidence that the
anticancer efficacy of R11-p53C was truly achieved by
activation or restoration of the of endogenous p53 protein,
although the detail of the molecular mechanism is unclear.
Most studies on anticancer transduction peptides
employed subcutaneous tumor model to determine the
therapeutic efficacy [20, 21]; this model may not mimic
cancer development particularly the influence of tumor
microenvironment. In this study, the anticancer efficacy
of R11-p53C was demonstrated by using orthotopic and
metastatic UCB animal models. We proved that R11p53C significantly decreased orthotopic and even distant
metastatic tumor burden.
One of the most interesting findings in the present
study is that delivery of the p53C peptide into p53 mutated
tumor cells not only inhibits bladder tumor growth in vivo,
but also dramatically extends animal survival in orthotopic
and lung metastatic cancer models. It’s known that most
patients succumb to cancer due to the metastatic disease
[22]. Moreover, the ability to alleviate pathology and
extend survival, not simply to reduce tumor volume, is
the key to create a truly successful anticancer therapeutics
in the clinic. Therefore, the present results suggest that
R11-p53C peptide may become a potential clinical therapy
option for aggressive UCB.
Combination chemotherapy has been the standard
of care for metastatic UCB since late 1980s. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

up to 50% of metastatic patients are ineligible for this
regimen due to the impaired renal function, co-morbidity
preventing high-volume hydration, or severe acute
toxicity (SAT) [23–25]. Our data indicated that R11-p53C
transduction does not induce any significant cytotoxicity
and hence this may be able to decrease the side effects in
cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
In conclusion, we successfully developed a CPP,
R11-p53C, which was specifically delivered and inhibited
UCB. Moreover, this study demonstrated that R11-p53C
induced a significant inhibition of tumor growth not only
regardless the state of p53, but also in orthotopic and
distant metastasis tumor animal models with an activation
or restoration of p53-dependent manner. We feel confident
that the peptide could be a promising therapeutic drug
for the treatment of UCB, especially be significant for
metastatic patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptide synthesis
p53C (GSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKK-FITC),
R11-p53C (R11-GG-GSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKFITC) and R11-Con. (a mutant form of R11-p53C: R11GG-GSRAHSSHLESAEGQSTSRHKK—FITC) peptides
were synthesized by automated peptide synthesizer
using the standard solid-phase chemistry. All peptides
were purified to > 95% purity by reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography. The structure of each
synthesized peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry.
Peptide stocks (10 mM) were prepared in DMSO and
stored in aliquots at -20°C.

Cell culture
The human UBC cell lines (T24 and 253J) and the
immortalized bladder epithelial cell line SV-HUC were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. T24-luc
sublines were generated after stable transfection with the
luciferase gene vector and G418 selection as our previous
reports [26] and maintained in DMEM supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum.

Cellular uptake and subcellular localization
in vitro
To determine the uptake efficiency of peptides,
1 × 105 cells per well were plated in a 12-well plate. Next
day, different concentrations of FITC-tagged peptides were
incubated with cells for 30 mins. The total cell number was
determined and cells were lysed in Tris [50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100].

The fluorescence intensity was examined by fluoro­
meter (excitation 490–500 nm; emission 515–525 nm). To
determine the subcellular localization of peptides, cells were
treated with three peptides for 30 mins and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 1 μg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) counterstaining, and
then examined under fluorescence microscope.

horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 hr. Signals were detected using chemilumine­
scence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Loading differences were
normalized using a monoclonal Actin antibody.

Effect of pifithrin-α on R11-p53C
For combination experiments, the T24 cells were
seeded in 6 or 96-well plates overnight and pifithrin-α
(20 μM) or DMSO was added 12 hrs before the peptide
and every 12 hrs thereafter until analysis. The cells seeded
in 6-well plates was isolated and analyzed using western
blot analysis, and the proliferation of the cells seeded in
96-well plates were determined using a MTT assay as
described above.

Cytotoxicity and cell cycle assay
To assess the cytotoxicity of peptides, 1 × 103
cells were seeded in a 96-well plate for 24 hrs and then
washed once with serum-free media before peptides
treatment in a final volume of 100μl in DMEM containing
2% FBS. After incubation at 37°C for 1 hr, cells were
washed twice with serum-free media and replaced with
fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. Fresh peptide was
added daily for 3 days. The cell viability was determined
at the indicated time after the initial treatment using
3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) following
manufacturer suggested protocol.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with
10 ng/ml propidium iodide after peptides treatment for
24 hrs and then subjected to FACS analyzed by CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA).

In vivo tumor growth inhibition and
biodistribution
Female nude (Balb/c nu/nu, 4–6 weeks age) mice
were used for generating both orthotopic and metastatic
models. The protocol is approved by Institutional
Animal Care and Usage Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong
University.
For the orthotopic model, intravesical tumor
implantation of T24-luc cells was performed as
previously described [26, 27]. Distant metastatic
tumors were developed by intravenously injection of
0.5 × 106 T24-luc cells in a final volume of 100 μL
saline. The lung metastasis was allowed to develop
14 days post-injection and periodically imaged by
bioluminescence imaging (BLI). To examine the
effect of peptides on tumor growth, the mice were
intraperitoneally injected with R11-p53C, or control
peptides (20 mg/kg) in 200 μL saline twice a week for
4 weeks once the BLI signal in tumors was detectable.
As a blank control, the mice were injected with saline
containing DMSO. BLI was performed weekly to
monitor the growth of tumor. The mice died before the
end-point of experiment were autopsied immediately
and the cause of the death was determined. If mice
died before the end-point of experiment without any
evidence of cancer, they were excluded from the data
collection.
To determine the uptake efficiency of peptides
in metastatic lesions, the groups of lung metastasis
model were sacrificed 2 hrs after injection with peptides
for determining biodistribution using fluorescence
microscopy. For biodistribution, one group of animal
(orthotopic tumor, n = 6) were intraperitoneally injected
with peptides. Each organ from the group was harvested
2 hrs after injection and homogenized with Tris buffer
and then the fluorescence intensity was examined by
fluorometer. The uptake efficiency of peptides was
determined by measuring the relative fluorescence
intensity normalized to tissue weight from each organ.

RNA isolation and qPCR analyses
T24 cells seeded in 6-well plates were incubated
with 5 μM R11-p53C or R11-Con. for 2 hrs. After
washed, the cells were further incubated in fresh medium
for 24 and 48 hrs, respectively. Total RNA was isolated
using TRIzol reagent obtained from Invitrogen. The
isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed using a kit from
Invitrogen (One-Step PCR) primed by random oligo
primers and then subjected to PCR analysis. Primers for
PUMA (forward 5′-GGACGACCTCAACGCACAGT
and reverse 5′- AATTGGGCTCCATCTCGGGG), p21
(also known as CDKN1A, forward 5′- TTAGGGCTTCCT
CTTGGAGAAGAT and reverse 5′- ATGTCAGAACCG
GCTGGGGATGTC), GADD45A (forward 5′- AAGGGG
CTGAGTGAGTTCAA and reverse 5′- TTTTCCTTCC
TGCATGGTTC) and PIG3 (also as known as TP53I3,
forward 5′- CGGAATTCCGATGGGAGGGG AGCCG
GGCC and reverse 5′- GGGGTACCCCCAGTTCACT
CTTTATTTC) were used. All experiments were repeated
at least thrice in duplicate.

Western blot analyses
In brief, cell lysates were harvested, and
proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and trans­
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were
incubated with appropriate primary p21 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and GADD45A
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies overnight and

pH 6.0) for 5 mins, and then endogenous peroxidase
and alkaline phosphatase activity were blocked with
Dual Block for 10 mins. The slides were then incubated
overnight at 4°C with p21 (1:75 dilutions) and Ki67 antibodies (1:100 dilutions). After washing, this
was followed by incubation with EnVision secondary
antibody for 30 mins at room temperature. Signals were
detected by adding substrate hydrogen peroxide using
diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen followed by
hematoxylin counterstaining. Finally, the staining result
was considered higher expression (intensity 2 or 3 and
percent category 2 or 3) or lower expression (intensity
0 or 1, or more but percent category 0 or 1). For each
section, the total score was calculated by multiplying the
scores of intensity and percentage.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative
data are presented as mean ± SD, and the differences
between two groups were compared by the 2-tailed
Student’s t test. Survival curves were plotted using
Kaplan–Meier analysis. P ≤ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
