Abstract
The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) remains challenging in
part due to the presence of stem-like tumor-propagating cells that
are resistant to standard therapies consisting of radiation and
temozolomide. Among the novel and targeted agents under evaluation for the treatment of GBM are BRAF/MAPK inhibitors, but
their effects on tumor-propagating cells are unclear. Here, we
characterized the behaviors of CD133þ tumor-propagating cells
isolated from primary GBM cell lines. We show that CD133þ cells
exhibited decreased sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of
BRAF/MAPK inhibition compared to CD133 cells. Furthermore,
CD133þ cells exhibited an extended G2–M phase and increased

polarized asymmetric cell divisions. At the molecular level, we
observed that polo-like kinase (PLK) 1 activity was elevated in
CD133þ cells, prompting our investigation of BRAF/PLK1 combination treatment effects in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model.
Combined inhibition of BRAF and PLK1 resulted in signiﬁcantly
greater antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects beyond those
achieved by monotherapy (P < 0.05). We propose that PLK1 activity
controls a polarity checkpoint and compensates for BRAF/MAPK
inhibition in CD133þ cells, suggesting the need for concurrent
PLK1 inhibition to improve antitumor activity against a therapyresistant cell compartment. Cancer Res; 75(24); 5355–66. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

of GBM (2, 3), and single-cell RNA sequencing has further
demonstrated the presence of multiple molecular subgroups
in different cells within a single tumor (4). The intratumoral
heterogeneity further manifests as mosaic expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (5, 6), gene copy number variation (7),
the presence of multiple genetically distinct clones (8), and the
existence of phenotypically distinct tumor-propagating cells
(TPC), as highlighted by studies examining the tumorigenicity
of xenotransplanted cells sorted from GBM surgical specimen
(7, 9, 10). One TPC population of particular interest expresses
the cell surface antigen CD133, and CD133þ TPCs were shown
to exhibit elevated resistance to standard therapy (11–16). In
contrast, NG2 positivity, that is associated with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), has been shown to identify TPCs
that respond well to chemotherapy (17, 18).
With increasingly routine tumor molecular proﬁling and the
ongoing movement towards the use of targeted therapeutics, it is
anticipated that molecular-informed therapeutic decision-making will improve the survival of patients with GBM. Differences
between stem and progenitor-like TPCs and other GBM cells
could lead to distinct, insufﬁcient responses to those recently
emerging targeted therapies and need to be investigated.
Neural stem cells (NSC), OPCs, and TPCs share the ability to
undergo asymmetric cell division (ACD). Cells acquiring polarity
and as a result segregating cell fate determinants unequally
between daughter cells at cytokinesis deﬁne ACD. Changes in
ACD have been associated with tumor initiation for several cancer
types, including GBM (19–21). ACD regulation requires the
coordinated activity of a network of polarity regulators and
mitotic kinases. This network is well characterized in invertebrate
stem cells, and has been shown to include polo kinase (19).

Patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and
malignant type of brain tumor in adults, have a poor prognosis despite aggressive ﬁrst-line treatment, which consists of
resection followed by radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (1). The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of GBM poses a major hurdle for the effective treatment of these tumors. Transcriptomic subclassiﬁcation analyses have revealed discrete molecular subgroups among series

However, for normal mammalian stem and progenitor cells
and TPCs, the extent to which polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1; ref. 22),
the mammalian homolog of polo kinase, affects ACD is
unknown.
Here, we have used human GBM models, to examine ACD in
CD133þ versus CD133NG2þ cell populations, and to study
their response to BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition. In a subset of
malignant astrocytoma the gene encoding cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is deleted, and RAS–RAF–MAPK
signaling is constitutively activated due to the BRAFV600E mutation (23). BRAFV600E astrocytoma have been reported to show
transient sensitivity to the antitumor effects of the mutant-selective inhibitor vemurafenib, in preclinical (24, 25) and clinical
settings (26). On the basis of clinical data from vemurafenib
treatment of BRAFV600E-melanoma (27), combination therapies
are needed to achieve a more durable antitumor effect than
BRAFV600E/MAPK pathway inhibition alone.
Our data show that CD133þ TPCs display reduced basal
proliferation that is less affected by BRAF/MAPK inhibition, in
relation to CD133NG2þ cells. The lower sensitivity to BRAF/
MAPK inhibition is accompanied by increased PLK1 activity and
higher rates of polarity and ACD, which can be suppressed by
PLK1 inhibition. Combined use of PLK1 and BRAF/MAPK inhibitors increases the antiproliferative and proapoptotic response,
especially towards CD133þ cells, and reduces growth of an
intracranial BRAFV600E-mutant xenograft more effectively than
single-agent treatment. The data support the existence of a mitotic
polarity/ACD checkpoint in CD133þ TPCs, which is susceptible
to PLK1 inhibition. We conclude that investigations into the
mechanism of ACD aid in the identiﬁcation of approaches that
support a more durable BRAF/MAPK inhibitor antitumor effect.

Materials and Methods
Immunoﬂuorescence
Tissue sections were generated from 8 GBM that were obtained
from consenting patients and distributed anonymously by the
Brain Tumor Research Center Repository at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). Tissue
sections from frozen primary GBM were cut at 5 mm from frozen
tissue samples and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
(PFA) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Tissue sections from
PFA-perfused mouse brains were cut and stained as free-ﬂoating
30 mm sections or as 12 mm sections. Cells were pulsed with
thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 minutes at indicated time points, then ﬁxed for 10 minutes with 4%
PFA at room temperature. EdU was detected using the Click-it
EdU detection kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Life
Technologies).
All samples for immunoﬂuorescence were washed with PBS,
blocked with PBSþ5% normal goat serum for 1 hour at room
temperature, and incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4 C (Supplementary Table S1). Samples were washed with PBS
and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature, washed with PBSþ0.2 mg/mL DAPI (to stain nuclei,
shown in blue), then with PBS, and mounted with Vectashield
(Vecta Labs #H-1000). Quantiﬁcation of cell counts and immunostainings in tumor sections were performed manually for
CD133, NG2, and activated cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), and the
number of Ki67þ cells and total cell numbers (DAPI) were
counted automatically using ImageJ.

Proliferation assays
Cells from culture or following FACS were plated into black
Cell-Bind 96-well plates (Corning #3340) at 500 cells per well in
100 mL of appropriate media  inhibitors as indicated in ﬁgures
and legends, with a minimum of 3 technical replicates per
condition. At 24, 72, and 120 hours, Alamar Blue (1:10) was
added and ﬂuorescence measured (excitation 560 nm, emission
580 nm) after 1 and 3 hours. Fold change was calculated from the
vehicle reading taken at 24 hours postplating.
Cell pair and polarity assays
Primary and adherent cell lines were dissociated to single cells,
passed through a 70 mm cell strainer, and plated at low density
(2,000 cells per 1.9 cm2 well) onto poly-L-lysine–coated glass
coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach or divide (polarity assays;
24 hours, cell pair assays 36–48 hours), inhibitors were added as
indicated in ﬁgures and ﬁgure legends, and cells were ﬁxed and
processed for immunoﬂuorescence. For polarity analysis, the sum
of the gray values in each of 24  15 segments was measured
using the Oval Proﬁle plugin for ImageJ, expressed as a percentage
of the gray value for each cell, aligned with the maximum at 0
using R, and values averaged across >30 cells per experiment. Cell
pairs were scored for asymmetric and symmetric protein distribution as previously described (20).
Cell culture and drug treatment
Primary human GBM cell lines (SF7996, SF8565, proneural
subtype) were isolated from surgical specimens obtained through
the UCSF Brain Tumor Research Center Biorepository at UCSF
(28). Primary cell lines were maintained in ultra low attachment
plates (Corning) in Neurobasal-A media (1 B27-A, 1 N2,
penicillin/streptomycin (pep/strep), L-glutamine, 10 ng/mL EGF,
and 10 ng/mL bFGF2). Primary cells were passaged using Accutase
#AM105. DBTRG-05MG and SF188 were obtained from the
Nicolaides and Pieper labs at UCSF and were cultured in 10 cm
plates (Corning) in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, pen/strep, 10% FBS)
and passaged using 0.25% trypsin. DBTRG cells were also kept in
primary cell conditions to increase the content of CD133þ cells
(DBTRG-SF). Cell lines were authenticated by DNA ﬁngerprinting. Cells were treated for 2 hours with vehicle (DMSO) or 5
mmol/L of the actin-organization inhibitor Latrunculin-A (LatA).
For Alamar Blue assays, cells were incubated with vehicle, 1 mmol/
L PD901, 5 nmol/L BI2536, or a combination of 1 mmol/L PD901
and 5 nmol/L BI2536 for 5 days. DBTRG-05MG cells were treated
with vehicle, 1 mmol/L PLX4720, 10 nmol/L BI2536, or a combination of 1 mmol/L PLX4720 and 10 nmol/L BI2536. For
desensitization of DBTRG-05M, cells were treated every three
days with escalating dosage of PLX4720 up to 6 mmol/L.
Flow cytometry and FACS
Cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using the FACSCalibur.
Cell sorting was performed using a BD Biosciences ARIA3 cytometer. For ﬂow cytometry, cells from culture were dissociated by
incubating with PBS (Ca2þ, MG2þ-free) þ 0.2 mmol/L EDTA for
10 minutes at 37 C, followed by mechanical dissociation in
PBSþ0.2 mmol/L EDTAþ0.5% BSA (FACS buffer) until a single-cell suspension was achieved. Cells from tumor were dissociated in 20 U/mL papain (Worthington Biochem), followed by
antigen recovery by incubation in neurosphere media for 3 hours
at 37 C. Alternatively, tumors were dissociated using the neural

stem cell dissociation kit (P; Miltenyi). Live dissociated cells were
stained with CD133 and NG2 for 15 minutes on ice, washed in
FACS buffer, and stained with secondary antibodies. For phospho-PLK1 (pT120-PLK1) and phospho-ERK (pERK) detection,
cells were ﬁxed in 2% PFA and permeabilized using 100%
methanol. For FACS, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer
containing 0.2 mg/mL DAPI.
Statistical analysis
Appropriate statistical analyses were performed as indicated in
ﬁgure legends using GraphPad Prism 5.0, Microsoft Excel, or
TreeStar FlowJo.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cultured cells were pulsed with EdU (10 mmol/L) for 30
minutes prior to dissociation and processing for FACS. For ex
vivo analysis of tumor cells, mice were injected with 100 mg/kg
EdU 30 minutes to two hours before tumor isolation. DAPI
(1 mg/mL) was added to cell suspensions 30 minutes before
analysis to measure DNA content.
RNA isolation and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from FACS-enriched cells or tumor
tissue using TRIzol reagent. RNA was reverse transcribed (Life
Technologies #4368814), and quantitative real-time PCR performed using Power SYBR qPCR mix (Life Technologies) using an
Applied Biosystems 7900HT thermal cycler, with primer sets
indicated in Supplementary Table S2. Fold changes were calculated using the DDCt method (29).
Xenograft models and preclinical treatment
For orthotopic tumor models, 6-week-old athymic mice
were implanted with luciferase-expressing DBTRG-05MG
cells (3  105 cells/mouse) at 1 mm anterior, 2 mm lateral,
and 3 mm deep (from Bregma). For ﬂank xenografts, 3  107
cells from previous generation ﬂank tumors were harvested and
implanted as previously described (25). Tumor growth was
measured by bioluminescence imaging and expressed as normalized bioluminescence (fold-change from the start of treatment). Treatment was started at 7 to 21 days postimplantation,
and continued for up to 9 days; PLX4720 was injected intraperitoneally at 20 mg/kg daily, whereas BI2536 was injected
intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg twice a week.

Results
CD133 and NG2 identify functionally distinct subpopulations
in human GBM
To examine the proportion of CD133- and NG2-positive
cells in GBM, we performed coimmunoﬂuorescence on human
GBM surgical specimens using CD133 and NG2 antibodies
(Fig. 1A). We found the frequencies of CD133 and NG2 cells to
be variable between patient samples with CD133 antibody
labeling 2% to 20% of tumor cells and NG2 antibody labeling
4% to 23% of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Less than
20% of CD133þ cells displayed NG2 staining, with NG2þ cells
showing a similar low frequency of CD133 costaining, indicating that the markers identify largely nonoverlapping
CD133þ and CD133NG2þ populations (Fig. 1B and C). In
contrast, costaining with NSC marker NESTIN and the OPC
marker OLIG2 revealed 83%  8% NESTIN positivity of
CD133þ cells, and 80%  9% OLIG2 positivity of NG2þ cells

(Fig. 1B and C). To assess proliferative differences between the
two CD133þ and NG2þ populations, we stained specimens for
the proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 1D), and quantiﬁed the
proportion of actively cycling cells in each subpopulation. We
found that the frequency of actively cycling NG2þ cells was not
signiﬁcantly different from that of bulk tumor cells. We also
discovered a signiﬁcantly lower frequency of Ki67 positivity
among CD133þ cells than for NG2þ cells: 11%  1% versus
16%  2%, respectively ( , P  0.005; Fig. 1E).
GBM cell cultures maintain discrete populations of CD133þ
and NG2þ cells
We next examined whether the proliferative differences
between CD133þ and NG2þ cells remain evident in established
GBM cell lines (DBTRG-05MG, aka DBTRG; SF188) and primary
GBM cell cultures (SF8565 and SF7996). We used ﬂow cytometry
to quantify the frequencies of CD133þNG2 (aka CD133þ) and
CD133NG2þ cells. Primary SF7996 and SF8565 cell lines contain a higher proportion of CD133þ cells than established DBTRG
and SF188 cell lines. We detected a CD133þ population that was
larger than the CD133þNG2þ population in all cell lines (Fig. 2A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), consistent with
results from the analysis of patient tumors.
To further characterize the CD133þ and CD133NG2þ cells,
we examined FACS-enriched populations as well as unsorted cells
for the expression of NSC genes NESTIN, SOX2, and MUSASHI1;
the OPC-speciﬁc transcription factor SOX10; and glial differentiation markers MBP and GFAP. We found that NSC gene expression is enriched in the CD133þ cells compared with NG2þ cells
and unsorted cells, while the SOX10 expression is enriched in the
NG2þ population. Glial differentiation marker expression shows
no enrichment in CD133þ cells while in NG2þ cells, MBP expression is elevated (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To investigate CD133þ cell characteristics in vitro, we subjected
FACS-enriched CD133þ, CD133NG2þ cells, and marker-negative cells to Alamar Blue assays. CD133þ cells showed signiﬁcantly
less viability than CD133NG2þ and marker-negative cells, the
latter two of which were very similar (Fig. 2C).
ACD is elevated in CD133þ GBM cells, in relation to NG2þ cells
Next we examined asymmetric cell divisions (ACD) in CD133þ
versus CD133NG2þ cells. Immunocytochemistry detecting the
subcellular localization of CD133 and NG2 and associated radial
proﬁle plots (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig. S3A) revealed
that CD133 protein in CD133þ cells exhibited a more polarized
or asymmetric subcellular distribution than NG2 protein in NG2þ
cells, which is consistent with the more unequal partitioning of
CD133 into daughter cells, as determined by pair assays (Fig. 3C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C; ref. 21). Taken
together, CD133þ cells consistently exhibited higher rates of
polarity and ACD than CD133NG2þ cells.
CD133þ cells have differential regulation of cell-cycle dynamics
As ACD and cell-cycle control are tightly linked, we next
examined whether CD133þ and CD133NG2þ cells exhibit
distinct cell-cycle dynamics. Rates at which CD133þ and
CD133NG2þ cells incorporated EdU were compared, with
results indicating that CD133þ cells have an extended G2–M
phase in relation to CD133NG2þ and unsorted cells (Fig. 3E
and Supplementary Fig. S3D). To distinguish M-phase cells, we
stained with the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (pHH3).
CD133þ cells showed increased pHH3 positivity, in relation to

CD133NG2þ cells (Fig. 3F). However, the fraction of CD133þ
cells that stained for pHH3 did not exceed 5% for any cell line,
indicating that most G2–M phase cells, as indicated by EdU
incorporation, are in G2 phase. It is important to note that the
higher proportion of G2–M cells in the CD133þ population
merely reﬂects the prolonged duration of these cell-cycle phases
in this population and does not imply overall increased rates of
proliferation.
Progression from G2–M phase occurs, in part, as a result of
PLK1 activity (30). PLK1 activation requires Threonine210 (T210)
phosphorylation, and pT210-PLK1–directed ﬂow cytometry is
used as a surrogate for assessing PLK1 activation. To understand
the molecular differences associated with extended G2–M phase
in CD133þ subpopulations, the frequency of pT210-PLK1þ
CD133þ and NG2þ cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry and
found to be higher in the CD133þ fraction than in the CD133
NG2þ or bulk tumor fraction (Fig. 3G). To determine whether
PLK1 activation is associated with CD133 polarization, we costained for pT210-PLK1 and CD133. In addition to substantiating
PLK1 localization to the centrosome in mitosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3E; 22), we detected active PLK1 at the cell periphery,
overlapping with CD133 staining (Fig. 3H). On the basis of the
totality of these data, we concluded that CD133þ cells differ from
autologous CD133NG2þ cells by having increased rates of
polarized, asymmetric divisions, an extended G2–M phase and
elevated levels of PLK1 activation.

suggests a link between polarity, PLK1 activation and passage
through G–M phase. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with
LatA, which is known to disrupt cell polarization by inhibiting
actin dynamics (20). We ﬁrst determined the cellular distribution of CD133 by immunocytochemistry. The effect of LatA was
evident by disrupted cellular morphologies with fewer projections and a more rounded appearance. In contrast to controltreated cells, which displayed polarized, membrane-bound
CD133, LatA-treated cells showed CD133þ staining as uniformly distributed dots, such that the polarization of CD133
was signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 4A and C and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). The localization of NG2, which was largely uniform
around the cortex in control cells, showed no signiﬁcant
changes following LatA treatment, except a stronger enrichment
at the cortex (Fig. 4B).
We next determined whether LatA treatment alters mitotic entry
and PLK activity. To this end, we subjected LatA-treated cells to
ﬂow cytometric analysis for pHH3, pT210-PLK1, CD133, or NG2
expression. A decrease in mitotic CD133þ cells, but not CD133
NG2þ or unsorted cells, was detected following LatA treatment
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Depending on the cell line,
the frequency of CD133þpT210-PLK1þ cells was reduced 2- to 10fold by LatA treatment (Fig. 4E–H).
Finally, we tested whether PLK1 activity is required for cell
polarity by plating cells at clonal densities in the presence of
vehicle or the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (20, 30). Treated cells were
ﬁxed and stained for CD133 (Fig. 4I). Quantiﬁcation of CD133
polarization revealed that PLK1 inhibition with BI2536 signiﬁcantly reduced CD133 polarization (Fig. 4J).
We therefore concluded that PLK1 activity, mitotic entry and
cell polarization are linked.

as elevated PLK1 activity in CD133þ cells and the cell-cycle data,

To examine the response of CD133þ cells to MAPK pathway
inhibition in vivo, subcutaneous DBTRG xenograft tumors were
serially propagated in athymic mice that received PLX4720 at 10
mg/kg/d (186 days total treatment). Flow cytometry analysis of
disaggregated tumor cells revealed a change in the cellular composition of tumors following extended BRAFV600E inhibition.
Whereas CD133NG2þ cells were effectively eliminated, the
frequency of CD133þ cells was signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 5E).
On the basis of these data, we concluded that short-term,
intermediate, and chronic BRAF/MAPK inhibition fails to diminish the viability of CD133þ cells.
Targeting PLK1 in combination with BRAF/MAPK inhibition
reduces GBM cell growth
Next we assessed whether elevated PLK1 activity provides a
point of susceptibility in CD133þ cells, and furthermore tested
whether combined PLK1 and BRAF/MAPK inhibition is more
effective than BRAF/MAPK inhibition alone at inhibiting tumor
cell viability in general and/or in speciﬁc cell populations. By
itself, PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6D)
blocked viability of unsorted cells in the nanomolar range.
Next, we performed Alamar Blue viability assays on GBM cell
lines treated for 5 days with PD901 or PLX4702 alone, or in
combination with BI2536. BI2536 decreased viability more
substantially than PD901 and PLX4720, in comparing singleagent effects. In all cases, combination treatments inhibited
proliferation to a greater extent than any single-agent treatment
(Fig. 6A and B). Treatment of DBTRG cells with PLX4720, for an
extended length of time and with increasing concentrations of
inhibitor, resulted in tumor cell adaptation to inhibitor, such
that cell viability in the presence of inhibitor became similar to
that of untreated cells. In contrast, BI2536 single-agent treatment of DBTRG showed sustained adverse effect on cell viability (Fig. 6C).

Concurrent inhibition of PLK1 and BRAFV600E has heightened
adverse effect on cell viability.
We next examined inhibitor effects on cell subpopulations in
vivo. Mice with subcutaneous BRAFV600E-mutant DBTRG xenograft tumors were treated with PLX4720 or BI2536 alone or in
combination. After 5 days treatment mice were injected with
EdU and then euthanized, with subcutaneous tumors immediately resected then disaggregated to create cell suspensions for
ﬂow sorting. CD133þ and CD133NG2þ cells were analyzed for
proliferation and cell-cycle effects. Single agent and combination treatments reduced S-phase cells in both CD133þ and
CD133NG2þ cell populations, with greatest S-phase effect
observed for CD133þ cells in tumors exposed to both inhibitors
(Fig. 7A). Combination treatment, as well as BI2536 only
treatment, signiﬁcantly increased the number of CD133þ cells
in G2–M, indicative of M-phase arrest (Fig. 7A). Further evidence that BI2536 effectively reaches tumor cells was provided
by immunoﬂuorescence of tumor tissue for pHH3, which
revealed increased numbers of mitotic cells with abnormally
shaped nuclei typically associated with PLK1 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S7A; ref. 30).
Mice with intracranial xenografts were also treated with inhibitors, alone or in combination, for up to 9 days, to investigate
whether an orthotopic microenvironment affects inhibitor activities against their corresponding targets. Dissociated DBTRG
tumor cells were examined by ﬂow cytometry for pT210-PLK1
and phospho-ERK (pERK) following PLX4720 and/or BI2536
treatments, with results showing the most substantial decrease
in active PLK1 following animal subject treatment with PLK1
inhibitor, alone or with PLX4720 (Supplementary Fig. S7B). In
contrast, PLX4720 showed greater inhibitory effect against pERK,
an indicator for BRAFV600E (24), than BI2536, with combination
PLX4720 þ BI2536 showing the most substantial effect in suppressing pERK (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Similar results were

and apoptosis by cleaved caspase-3 staining, with corresponding results showing combination treatment as producing the
most signiﬁcant antiproliferative response (6-fold vs. control
and PLX4720 treated and 3-fold vs. BI2536 treated) towards
CD133þ cells (Fig. 7B). The combination treatment also had a
strong proapoptotic effect on tumor cells and CD133þ cells in
particular (5-fold vs. control and two point 5-fold vs. single
agents; Fig. 7C). Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were
conﬁrmed by bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-modiﬁed
DBTRG intracranial xenografts, which showed combination
therapy as having greatest activity in suppressing tumor growth
(Fig. 7D).

Discussion
Recent reports have shown that TPCs are genetically and
phenotypically heterogeneous, consisting of populations with
distinct responsiveness to therapy (13, 16). These observations
have prompted us to perform side-by-side analyses of CD133þ
and NG2þ TPC subpopulations for differential response to MAPK
pathway inhibition. Consistent with the results of previous studies (31, 32), we determined that autologous CD133þ cells show
reduced proliferation in relation to unsorted tumor cells as well as
in relation to CD133 tumor cells, whether in human tumor
tissue or cell culture, and irrespective of cell culture conditions
(33–35). In contrast, we found NG2þ cells as having very similar
proliferation characteristics as bulk, unsorted tumor cells, and that
were at higher rates than CD133þ cells.
In addition, our results show distinct cell cycle dynamics and
ACD rates, with CD133þ cell characteristics that are reminiscent of
the healthy mouse brain, and in which NSCs comprise a partly
quiescent population that, when activated to proliferate, predominantly divides asymmetrically (36–38). NG2þ tumor cells, on the
other hand, undergo fewer ACD than CD133þ cells and predominantly divide symmetrical, in line with previous data in oligodendroglioma (20). Our ﬁndings that CD133þ TPCs are less
proliferative while maintaining a higher rate of ACD is consistent
with a role for ACD in restricting proliferation.
Many ACD regulators, which have been extensively studied in
invertebrates, are conserved in the mammalian genome (19). The
activity of one of these, PLK1, is known to increase in G2 phase of
the cell cycle (39). The reciprocal relationship between PLK1
activity and cell polarity, reported in invertebrate model systems
(40–42) and shown for the ﬁrst time here in CD133þ TPCs,
suggests a cell-cycle checkpoint in which PLK1 activation and cell
cycle G2–M progression occurs only when appropriate polarity is
achieved (Fig. 7E).
The use of chemotherapeutics that disrupt cell polarity could
activate this checkpoint, which, in turn, could spare tumor cells
from continued cell progression and potential mitotic catastrophe. Through a pharmacologic approach, we have shown that
inhibition of this checkpoint not only increases tumor cell apoptosis, especially in the CD133þ subpopulation, but as well limits
the proliferation of this important class of TPC.
The discovery of a BRAFV600E mutation in a subset of GBM
(23) and encouraging GBM response to BRAFV600E inhibition

in preclinical models (24, 25) has prompted ongoing clinical
trials for using BRAF inhibitors to treat glioma patients (26,
27). However, preexisting and acquired resistance to BRAFV600E
inhibitor is known to occur (43, 44) and as a result several
combination therapy approaches are being investigated for
increasing the duration and extent of antitumor activity from
inhibiting mutant BRAF.
PLK1 is highly expressed in gliomas and GBM (45) and has
previously been shown to enhance radiosensitivity in brain tumor
models (46). Our discovery that simultaneous MAPK pathway
and PLK1 inhibition is especially effective against CD133þ GBM
cell subpopulations, which are known to be resistant to routinely
used therapies, supports the need to further develop this treatment concept for clinical translation and evaluation in GBM
patients.
