Summary

Author Manuscript

Many chemotherapeutic drugs kill only a fraction of cancer cells, limiting their efficacy. We used
live-cell imaging to investigate the role of p53 dynamics in fractional killing of colon-cancer cells
in response to chemotherapy. We found that both surviving and dying cells reach similar levels of
p53, indicating that cell death is not determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Instead, a cell’s
probability of death depends on the time and levels of p53. Cells must reach a threshold level of
p53 to execute apoptosis and this threshold increases with time. The increase in p53 apoptotic
threshold is due to drug-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes, predominantly in the
inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. Our study underlines the importance of measuring the
dynamics of key players in response to chemotherapy to determine mechanisms of resistance and
optimize the timing of combination therapy.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment.
Considerable effort has been put forward to understand mechanisms of resistance in order to
disrupt them and improve patient outcomes. In many cases resistance has been linked to
specific mutations in a subset of tumor cells, allowing them to survive chemotherapy
treatment (Holohan et al., 2013). Investigations into isogenic populations of tumor cells
reveal that resistance also emerges through non-genetic mechanisms, often through
stochastic fluctuations in key factors in response to the drug (Cohen et al., 2008; Kreso et al.,
2013; Roesch et al., 2010; Roux et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 2009).
Resistance can last days in some cases (Flusberg et al., 2013) and weeks in others (Sharma
et al., 2010).

For many cancer types, the p53 transcription factor is a key player in the cellular response to
DNA damage induced by chemotherapy (Figure 1A, Vazquez et al., 2008). DNA-damaging
agents disrupt the interaction between p53 and its transcriptional target and negative
regulator Mdm2, leading to stabilization of p53 (Haupt et al., 1997). Increased abundance of
p53 triggers the transcription of multiple genes in various downstream programs, including
apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (Riley et al., 2008). Previous studies have suggested a
threshold mechanism where the choice between alternative programs depends upon p53
protein levels (Chen et al., 1996; Kracikova et al., 2013). In these models low levels of p53
trigger cell-cycle arrest and high levels of p53 lead to apoptosis. In addition, p53’s affinity
for different target genes was shown to depend on the presence of specific transcriptional cofactors or post-translational modifications (Das et al., 2007; Samuels-Lev et al., 2001; Tang
et al., 2006, 2008). More recently we have shown that the dynamics of p53 play a role in the
specificity of the response with pulsed p53 favoring DNA repair and cell-cycle arrest genes,
and sustained p53 triggering activation of senescence and apoptotic genes (Batchelor et al.,
2011; Purvis et al., 2012). The variation in p53 dynamics between individual cells and the
potential effect of such variation on the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy has not
been explored.

Here we studied the role of p53 dynamics in the fractional killing response to chemotherapy
drugs with a focus on cisplatin. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that forms
both inter and intra-strand DNA crosslinks as well as protein-DNA crosslinks which are
highly toxic to rapidly dividing cancer cells (Kelland, 2007). Human colon cancer cells
treated with intermediate doses of cisplatin show a heterogeneous response; a fraction of
cells die while others enact cell-cycle arrest (Figure 1B, Berndtsson et al., 2007). By
quantifying p53 levels in single cells treated with cisplatin we found a strong link between
apoptosis and the dynamics of p53. Specifically, apoptotic cells accumulated p53 earlier and
faster than surviving cells. Our analysis revealed that cells must reach a critical threshold
level of p53 in order to enact apoptosis and this threshold increases with time following drug
treatment.
We further showed that the increase in the apoptotic threshold over time is not due to
diminished p53 activity but instead is linked to the upregulation of genes in the inhibitors of
apoptosis (IAP) family. LCL-161, a small molecule which inhibits IAP proteins and is
currently under clinical trials, significantly abolished the increase in the p53 apoptotic
threshold with time. Increased IAP expression inhibits two separate apoptotic pathways
which are differentiated by their dependence on caspase-8/Rip1. Our work points to p53
dynamics as a critical node underlying resistance to cisplatin and highlights the importance
of studying individual cell behaviors for designing efficient drug combinations.

Results
A system to quantify p53 dynamics and cell fate in single cells
We developed a system to measure p53 dynamics and cell fate in single human colon cancer
cells (HCT116) following cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin was previously shown to induce
p53-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells (Berndtsson et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2013). We
created an isogenic HCT116 p53 Venus knock-in cell line (p53-VKI), in which one allele of

p53 is tagged with a Venus fluorescent protein at the C-terminus of exon 11 (Figure 1C).
The other allele of p53 is wild type and unaltered. We verified that p53-Venus levels
mimicked induction of endogenous p53, indicating that the Venus tag does not alter the
regulation of p53 dynamics in response to cisplatin (Figure 1D). In addition, survival curves
revealed that parental HCT116 and p53-VKI cells show a similar dose-dependent decrease
in viability in response to cisplatin (Figures 1E and S1A) indicating that Venus tagged p53
does not alter p53 activity in response to cisplatin.

Author Manuscript

We treated HCT116 p53-VKI cells with cisplatin and measured nuclear p53-Venus levels
and cellular outcomes (apoptosis or survival) in single cells (Figure 1F). Cells were tracked
for 72 hours as apoptotic events had largely ceased by this time (Figure S1A and S1B). Cells
that did not die enacted cell-cycle arrest (Figures 1F and S1E, F). We observed induction of
p53 in both apoptotic and surviving cells, yet there was substantial heterogeneity in the
levels, rate and timing of p53 induction between cells (Figures 1F and S1C).
Rapid accumulation of p53 is associated with cell death

Author Manuscript

To determine what features of p53 dynamics are associated with apoptosis, we extracted
multiple parameters from the p53 trajectory of each cell and compared these parameters
between apoptotic and surviving cells (Figure 2A). We initially focused on 12.5 µM cisplatin
as this provided equal population sizes of apoptotic and surviving cells in our experimental
system (Figure S1D). We found that maximum p53 levels did not differ between apoptotic
and surviving cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that cell death is not simply determined by a
fixed p53 threshold. Time-integrated p53 was also not associated with cell death (Figure
2C). In fact, surviving cells showed higher integrated levels of p53 than apoptotic cells. This
is likely because p53 traces of surviving cells last longer than traces of apoptotic cells
(Figure S2A).
The rate of p53 accumulation was associated with cell death. Apoptotic cells showed a faster
accumulation of p53 than surviving cells (Figure 2D) and a shorter time to reach halfmaximal p53 levels (Figure 2E). This difference in rate was strongly reflected in the time it
took for p53 to reach 2 standard deviations above its basal levels (Figure 2A, F). By this
measure, apoptotic cells accumulate p53 significantly earlier than cells that survived
cisplatin treatment (Figure 2F). We refer to this metric as “p53 onset” and use it to describe
the time of p53 induction throughout this paper.

Author Manuscript

In agreement with our previous work (Loewer et al., 2010), approximately 12% of cells
show high basal levels of p53 before cisplatin treatment (Figure S2B). To test the role of
these cells in contributing to the correlation between early p53 induction and cell death, we
removed them from our data set and re-analyzed the metrics in Figure 2A. This analysis
revealed similar trends as the complete data set (Figure S2C–G), suggesting that cells with
high basal levels of p53 are not responsible for the differences between apoptotic and
surviving cells.
To investigate the effect of cisplatin dose on p53 onset, we treated cells with half and double
the IC50 concentration of cisplatin (Figure 2G–I). Cells treated with a low concentration of
cisplatin showed a later p53 onset and a decreased amount of cell death (Figure 2G, J), while

a higher cisplatin concentration led to an earlier p53 onset and more cell death (Figure 2I, J).
For all concentrations tested, apoptotic cells did not have higher maximum or integrated p53
levels, but did accumulate p53 earlier than surviving cells (Figure S2H–J). Similar trends
were found in response to two other chemotherapy drugs, the topoisomerase I inhibitor
camptothecin and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (Figure S3), suggesting that the
correlation between early induction of p53 and cell death is not limited to cisplatin but rather
general to other DNA damaging drugs.

Author Manuscript

To further explore the correlation between the timing of p53 accumulation and cell fate, we
combined p53 traces from all three doses of cisplatin into a viability matrix that calculates
the percentage of apoptotic cells given the time in which cells accumulated different levels
of p53 (Figure 2K, L). To do this we broke up each p53 trace into 5 hour time intervals.
Within each time interval we binned cells according to integrated p53 levels and determined
what percentage of cells in each bin died in response to cisplatin. The resultant viability
matrix shows the percentage of apoptotic cells given a specific range of p53 levels (Y-axis)
and the time that cells reached that level (X-axis). The matrix shows that within each time
interval, cells with higher levels of p53 are more likely to die than cells with lower levels of
p53 (Figure 2K). In addition, within each p53 level interval, cells that reached that level
earlier had a higher probability of apoptosis. These data show that a cell’s probability of
death depends on both the timing and levels of p53 induction.

These results led us to propose that p53 must reach a critical threshold level in order to
trigger apoptosis and that this threshold increases with time after cisplatin treatment.
Therefore cells that accumulate p53 slower must reach higher levels of p53 in order to
induce apoptosis. Consistent with this, we found a positive correlation between the time of
death and the integrated p53 levels of apoptotic cells (Pearson’s R = .54 Figure S2K). In
order to visualize how the p53 apoptotic threshold changes over time, we sought to plot a
threshold that most accurately separates the apoptotic and surviving cells. To do this we
performed a logistic regression analysis on each time window of the viability matrix in
Figure 2K. We then used this data to assess the level of p53 required in each time window
for at least 75% of cells to die (Figure 2L). This analysis produced a threshold that increases
with time and has an accuracy of 70% (Figure 2L). Fixed threshold models performed
poorly in comparison to an increasing threshold (Figure S3M). Although some reached
accuracies of ~54%, they used an arbitrarily low threshold which maximizes true positives at
the expense of true negatives. Linear thresholds that maximized both true positives and true
negatives were only ~40% accurate (Figure S3N). Note that while an increasing threshold
more accurately predicts cell death than a fixed threshold, there is still an overlap in p53
dynamics in surviving and apoptotic cells (Figure 2K and L). This is likely due to
fluctuations in other cellular factors that control apoptosis in response to DNA damage (e.g.
Cohen et al., 2008).
Accelerating p53 accumulation early after cisplatin treatment increases cell death
We experimentally tested the increasing threshold model by accelerating the rate of p53
accumulation at different times post cisplatin treatment and measuring the effect on cell fate
(Figure S4). Acceleration of p53 was achieved using Nutlin-3, a small molecule that

stabilizes p53 without further inducing DNA damage (Vassilev et al., 2004). Addition of
Nutlin-3 to cells early in the response (5 hours after cisplatin treatment) led to an earlier p53
onset and to a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (Figures 3 A,B and
S4B). Interestingly, when cells were treated with Nutlin-3 late (30 hours after cisplatin
treatment), p53 reached similar maximum levels and higher integrated levels than cells
treated with Nutlin-3 early (Figures 3C, D and S4C). However, late acceleration of p53 had
only a modest effect on cell death (Figure 3A). These experiments support a model in which
the potential for p53 to enact the apoptotic program decreases with time.
p53 activates apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest genes regardless of the time of activation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

What mechanistically moves the p53 threshold with time? We first asked whether p53 target
genes in different programs respond differently to the time of p53 induction. Specifically,
does rapidly-induced p53 favor the induction of apoptotic genes while slow accumulation of
p53 favors cell-cycle arrest genes? To test the relationship between p53 dynamics and its
target genes in different programs we created a cell line expressing reporters for PUMA, a
p53 target gene in the apoptosis pathway (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al., 2001) and
p21, a CDK inhibitor that causes cell-cycle arrest (Figure 4A, el-Deiry et al., 1993). Both
PUMA and p21 levels are increased by cisplatin treatment (Duale et al., 2007) and HCT116
PUMA−/− cells have reduced sensitivity to cisplatin (Jiang et al., 2006). We tracked PUMA
and p21 induction in single cells after cisplatin treatment and quantified their dynamics
together with p53 and cell fate (Figure 4B and 4C). We found that PUMA and p21 were
induced in both apoptotic and surviving cells (Figure 4D and 4E). Moreover, we observed a
positive correlation between integrated p53 levels and integrated PUMA and p21 levels
(Figure 4F and 4G). This suggests that p53 accumulation simply translates into PUMA and
p21 induction regardless of the time of p53 activation. Indeed, we found no correlation
between the time of p53 onset and the level of PUMA or p21 expression (Figure 4H and 4I).
These results show that the ability of p53 to transcribe apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest genes
does not change over time, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the increase
in the p53 threshold required for apoptosis.
Cisplatin upregulates Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs)

Author Manuscript

Another possible mechanism for the increasing threshold is that cisplatin might upregulate
anti-apoptotic proteins that antagonize p53-dependent apoptosis. In this scenario, slow
accumulation of p53 allows time for apoptotic inhibitors to build up, compete with apoptotic
genes and prevent cell death. A buildup of apoptotic inhibitors increases the amount of p53
required to enact apoptosis. To identify putative anti-apoptotic genes that move the p53
threshold, we used a publicly available microarray dataset of HCT116 cells treated with
cisplatin (Duale et al., 2007). We searched for genes that were significantly upregulated after
cisplatin treatment (P<.05) and associated with negatively regulating apoptosis (GO ID:
0043066). This analysis revealed three genes from the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family
(cIAP1, cIAP2, and ML-IAP/LIVIN). Overexpression of IAP proteins was previously shown
to decrease apoptosis in response to different DNA-damaging agents (Liston et al., 1996;
Vucic et al., 2000). In addition, IAP proteins are frequently overexpressed in tumors and
associated with poor patient survival and resistance to chemotherapy (Lopes et al., 2007;
Nakagawa et al., 2006).

We measured the fold change in gene expression for the three IAP genes identified by the
search, as well as XIAP, an additional member in the IAP family. Cisplatin led to an increase
in the expression of all four IAP genes tested, with cIAP2 and ML-IAP showing the
strongest induction (Figure 5A). Western blots confirmed an increase in all four IAP proteins
in response to cisplatin (Figure 5B and 5C). Etoposide, camptothecin and doxorubicin also
caused a similar increase in IAP gene expression (Figure S5A). In addition, analysis of other
microarray data sets (Altena et al., 2015; Hussner et al., 2012) revealed that induction of IAP
genes after doxorubicin or cisplatin treatment occurs in other cancerous (HeLa, Figure S5B)
and primary (HMEC-1, Figure S5C) cell lines. Together these results suggest that induction
of IAP proteins by DNA damaging agents is not limited to cisplatin or HCT116 cells (Figure
S5A–C).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To further test the potential role of IAP proteins in preventing apoptosis following DNA
damage we expressed each of the four induced IAP genes from a constitutive CMV
promoter (Figure S5D–G). Overexpression of each gene increased the viability of HCT116
cells following cisplatin treatment (Figure 5D). Consistent with these findings, CRISPR/
Cas9 knockouts of cIAP1 and cIAP2 sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment (Figures 5E and
S5H). Several attempts to knockout XIAP and ML-IAP were unsuccessful. We therefore
used LCL-161, a small molecule that inhibits proteins in the IAP family by binding to a
common BIR domain (Fulda and Vucic, 2012). LCL-161 alone had no effect on the viability
of HCT116 cells, but a combination treatment of LCL-161 with cisplatin led to a significant
decrease in viability (Figure 5F). Similar interactions were observed between LCL-161 and
other DNA damaging agents that induce the expression of IAP proteins (Figure S5A and
S5I). Importantly, the effect of LCL-161 on cisplatin treated cells was p53 dependent (Figure
5F), supporting the hypothesis that upregulation of IAP proteins inhibits p53-dependent
apoptosis.
IAP inhibitors flatten the increase in the apoptotic threshold of p53

Author Manuscript

If induction of IAP proteins competes with p53 over time then inhibition of these proteins
should increase the time-window in which cisplatin is effective by flattening the apoptotic
threshold. We tested this hypothesis using the IAP inhibitor LCL-161. In addition to
LCL-161, we also separately tested the effect of ABT-263, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor.
ABT-263 is known to lower the p53 apoptotic threshold (Kracikova et al., 2013), but unlike
LCL-161, the targets of ABT-263 (BCL2, BCL-XL) show little or no induction by cisplatin
(Figure 5G), suggesting that they do not contribute to the increase in the p53 apoptotic
threshold with time. Similar to LCL-161, ABT-263 alone had no effect on the viability of
HCT116 cells, but a combination treatment with cisplatin and ABT-263 led to a significant
decrease in viability (Figure 5H). Single cell traces revealed that neither ABT-263 nor
LCL-161 affected the timing of p53 accumulation (Figure S6A) or the maximum levels of
p53 (Figure S6B).
We next produced a viability matrix for each data set and performed logistic regression to
measure how ABT-263 and LCL-161 affect the p53 apoptotic threshold over time (Figure
S6C, E). As described above, cisplatin treated cells showed a steady increase in the apoptotic
threshold (Slope = 15.2, Figure 2L). This was reflected by a positive correlation between the

time of death and the integrated p53 levels of apoptotic cells (R2 = .29 Figure S2K).
Treatment with a combination of cisplatin and LCL-161 lowered the apoptotic threshold and
most importantly made the threshold less time-dependent (Slope = 4.3, Figures 5I and S6C).
Consistent with this, we found no correlation between the time of death and integrated p53
levels (R2 =.06, Figure S6D). Cells treated with cisplatin and ABT-263 showed a lower
apoptotic threshold that still increases with time (Slope = 10.5) yet at a lower rate than
cisplatin alone, but faster than cells treated with cisplatin and LCL-161 (Figures 5J and
S6E). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the time of death and integrated
p53 levels in cells treated with ABT-263 and cisplatin (R2 = .37, Figure S6F). Taken
together, our results suggest that induction of anti-apoptotic genes, predominantly genes in
the IAP family, compete with p53 and therefore increases the amount of p53 required to
execute apoptosis with time.

Author Manuscript

IAP proteins suppress separate apoptotic pathways and their induction is partially
dependent on p53

Author Manuscript

Proteins in the IAP family are known to inhibit different apoptotic pathways. For example,
cIAP1, cIAP2 (and to some extent XIAP) are known to inhibit an apoptotic pathway that
involves caspase-8/RIP1/FADD (Tenev et al., 2011; Varfolomeev et al., 2007; Vince et al.,
2007). In addition, both XIAP and ML-IAP are known to inhibit apoptosis either by direct
binding and inhibition of caspases (XIAP) or by binding to Smac, a caspase activator (Fulda
and Vucic, 2012). To test the relative contribution of each of these pathways to apoptosis
after cisplatin, we first deleted caspase-8 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure S5J) and measured
cell viability. We found that caspase-8−/− cells were less sensitive to cisplatin and to a
combination of cisplatin with LCL-161 than wild-type cells (Figure 6A). Cells treated with
the Rip1 kinase inhibitor Necrostatin-1 showed a similar pattern of cisplatin resistance
(Figure 6B), that was caspase-8 dependent (Figure 6C). These results suggest that a fraction
of cell death in response to cisplatin is caspase-8/Rip1 dependent.

Author Manuscript

In order to determine whether upregulation of IAP genes inhibits the caspase-8 independent
pathway, we expressed each of the four induced IAP genes from a constitutive CMV
promoter in caspase-8−/− cells. We found that both XIAP and ML-IAP overexpression
significantly increased the viability of wild-type and caspase-8−/− cells (Figures 5D and
6D). In contrast, cIAP1 and cIAP2 overexpression protected wild-type cells, but had no
effect on the viability of caspase8−/− cells after cisplatin treatment (Figures 5D and 6D).
These data suggest that cisplatin induces cell death through two separate apoptotic
pathways; one pathway is dependent on caspase-8/Rip1, while the other acts independent of
caspase-8. Cisplatin also induces cIAP1/cIAP2 expression which prevents caspase-8
dependent apoptosis, and ML-IAP/XIAP expression which inhibits caspase-8 independent
apoptosis (Figure 6F).
Lastly, we asked whether p53 contributes to the anti-apoptotic arm in response to cisplatin
and specifically to the induction of IAPs. Measuring the expression of IAP genes in wild
type and p53−/− lines following cisplatin treatment revealed that induction of two IAP genes
(cIAP2 and XIAP) was reduced in a p53 null line, while induction of the other two IAP
genes (cIAP1 and ML-IAP) was induced to similar levels (Figure 6E). Interestingly the two

p53 dependent genes include one gene that inhibits caspase-8 dependent apoptosis and one
that inhibits caspase-8 independent apoptosis (Figure 6F and 6G). A similar pattern was
found for the two p53-independent genes (Figure 6G). This analysis suggests a specific
combination of regulation and function for each IAP gene induced by DNA damage (Figure
6G).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy is used to treat almost all types of cancer. Yet the response to chemotherapy
is often incomplete, with a subset of cells surviving treatment (Almendro et al., 2012). The
fraction of cells that die in response to chemotherapy increases with the dose, however doses
are limited by the toxic side effects to the patient. Consequently one potential way to
improve patient outcomes is through increasing drug efficacy. An understanding of the
source of heterogeneity within a tumor and how such heterogeneity contributes to resistance
could lead to more effective treatment strategies. Here we looked at the variation in the
temporal behavior of p53 in single cells in response to cisplatin and other DNA damaging
agents and asked how such variations are linked with cell-fate decisions. DNA damage
activates p53, which in turn leads to the transcription of genes required for both cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis. Yet it is unclear why increased p53 levels lead to cell-cycle arrest in
some cases and apoptosis in others (Carvajal and Manfredi, 2013) and why isogenic
populations exhibit a mix of outcomes to the same stimulus.

Author Manuscript

We used live cell imaging over multiple days to track p53 dynamics and cell fate in single
colon cancer cells in response to chemotherapy treatment. This revealed that p53 must reach
a critical threshold level in order to execute apoptosis and this threshold increases over time.
Consequently, cells that accumulate p53 slower must reach higher levels of p53 in order to
enact apoptosis. We have also shown that enhancing the rate of p53 induction by Nutlin-3, a
small molecule that inhibits Mdm2 and stabilizes p53, increases cell death (Figure 3). It is
perhaps not surprising that stabilizing p53 leads to more cell death; however, we have also
shown that the time at which Nutlin-3 is added after cisplatin is critical. Specifically, if
Nutlin-3 is added too late then p53 levels are enhanced, yet this has a minimal impact on cell
death (Figure 3). A recent study in triple-negative breast cancer cells revealed a similar
dependence on timing when cells were treated with a combination of doxorubicin and
erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor (Lee et al., 2012). It is likely that other combination therapies
can be optimized by altering the timing of drug additions. For p53 targeted therapy, many
have suggested using Mdm2 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy for treating
tumors (Shangary and Wang, 2009; Vassilev, 2007). The results described in this study
highlight the fundamental role that timing plays in such strategies.

Author Manuscript

Although time affected the p53 apoptotic threshold, it did not affect p53 transcriptional
capability, as induction of p21 and PUMA were proportional to integrated p53 in single cells
(Figure 4). Similar results were shown using population measurements after p53 induction
with an inducible promoter (Kracikova et al., 2013). We have further shown that the increase
in the apoptotic threshold over time was due to induction of genes in the IAP family by
cisplatin and other DNA damaging agents (Figures 5 and S5). IAP proteins are commonly
overexpressed in tumors and are associated with resistance to chemotherapy (Fulda and

Vucic, 2012; Lopes et al., 2007) making them attractive candidates for targeted therapy. A
number of different “Smac-mimetic” compounds have been developed to inhibit IAP
proteins and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy (Fulda and Vucic, 2012). We showed
here that one such compound, LCL-161, dramatically reduced the increase in the p53
apoptotic threshold (Figure 5). For this study we focused on HCT116, a colon cancer cell
line. Yet, it is likely that other cell lines also exhibit an increase in the p53 apoptotic
threshold over time, as both HeLa cells and HMEC-1 cells induce genes in the IAP family
after DNA damage (Figure S5B, C). An increase in the expression of IAP genes after DNA
damage was also found in breast (Rashi-Elkeles et al., 2014) and thyroid (Tirrò et al., 2006)
cancer lines. However, not all thyroid lines show increased induction of IAP genes,
suggesting that the increase in the p53 apoptotic threshold with time might exist in some, but
not all cell lines.

Our study raises the question of why both pro and anti-apoptotic pathways are upregulated
by the same stimulus. One possibility is that this allows cells to identify the magnitude of the
damage and respond accordingly. DNA damaging agents do not lead to a fixed number of
lesions in individual cells. Instead, cells vary in the number of lesions acquired (Liedert et
al., 2006; Loewer et al., 2013). Cells that acquire a large number of lesions might reach high
p53 levels rapidly and enact apoptosis before IAP proteins accumulate. Cells with few
lesions will upregulate p53 slowly leading to cell-cycle arrest and slow accumulation of
apoptotic proteins. This gives IAP proteins time to accumulate and prevent premature cell
death. In support of this model, cells treated with low levels of cisplatin accumulate p53
slower than cells with high levels of cisplatin (Figure 2G–J). Other factors likely contribute
to differences in the rate of p53 accumulation, such as cell-cycle phase and the stochastic
fluctuation of proteins in the p53 network. Further studies are required to determine the
contribution of potential factors to the heterogeneous rate of p53 induction in response to
DNA damage.

(Hao and O’Shea, 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2002; Kuchina et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014; Purvis
and Lahav, 2013; Toettcher et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013). In mammalian systems, proteins
known to control outcomes through signaling dynamics are frequently associated with
human disease. The ability to alter cell fate by modifying protein dynamics with
combination therapies provides a novel therapeutic opportunity (Behar et al., 2013). A
quantitative understanding of the dynamics of IAP proteins, how they vary between
individual cells and their relative rate in comparison to p53 induction rates, is important for
designing effective treatments. For example, our work suggests that high IAP protein levels
induced by the initial round of treatment could diminish the effectiveness of secondary
rounds of treatment. Therefore it could prove beneficial to take a “drug-holiday” until IAP
proteins have returned to basal levels before administering additional treatments. This
strategy has proved effective for other chemotherapy drugs (Becker et al., 2011; Das Thakur
et al., 2013). Additional single-cell approaches measuring anti-apoptotic pathways could
help inform dose schedules for optimal drug treatment.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy’s with 10% FBS, 100µg/ml penicillin, 0.25µg/ml
streptomycin and 85µg/ml Amphotericin. When necessary, McCoy’s media was
supplemented with 5µg/ml blasticidin, 50µg/ml hygromycin and 0.5µg/ml puromycin.
Cell Line Construction
Construction of the p53-VKI cell line is described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.

Author Manuscript

To construct the p21 and PUMA reporters we used multisite gateway cloning (Invitrogen,
Eugene, OR). 2.4kb of the p21 promoter sequence (el-Deiry et al., 1993) was cloned
upstream of ECFP-PEST-NLS sequence in a lentiviral vector with the blasticidin resistance
gene. We cloned the two p53 response elements from the PUMA promoter using the PUMA
Frag2-Luc plasmid (Yu et al., 2001) upstream of mCherry-PEST-NLS into a lentiviral vector
with the hygromycin resistance gene. HCT116 p53-VKI cells were infected with lentivirus
containing both reporters as described above and grown in media containing 50µg/ml
hygromycin and 0.5µg/ml puromycin. Clones were isolated as described above.
Western Blot Analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed once with 1X PBS and flash frozen in ethanol and dry ice. Cells were
lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%
deoxycholate, .1% SDS). We measured protein concentration by a BCA assay (Pierce) and
ran equal protein concentrations on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen). Protein was
transferred to a PVDF membrane and incubated in blocking solution (5% nonfat dried milk,
0.1% Triton X-100, 1X PBS) for 2h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated
with primary antibody (in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C. Blots were washed 3X for 5m
in washing solution (50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, .05% Tween-20) and then
incubated in blocking solution plus secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase (Sigma) for
1h. Membranes were washed 3X in washing solution and we detected protein levels with
chemiluminescence (ECL Prime GE Healthcare). Molecular weights were identified using a
protein standard (Precision Plus, Bio-Rad).
Live-Cell Microscopy

Author Manuscript

Approximately 10,000 cells were plated in McCoy’s media with 10% FBS to poly-D-lysine
coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek corporation). Cells were grown for 72h prior to imaging
to allow cells to attach to dishes. Before imaging, media was replaced with RPMI without
phenol red or riboflavin and supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were imaged on a Nikon
Eclipse TE-2000 inverted microscope in an enclosure to maintain humidity, a temperature of
37 °C and 5% CO2. Images were captured every 30m using MetaMorph software. Filter sets
are listed in the supplement. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH) and Matlab
(MathWorks).

Viability Matrix

Author Manuscript

Using Matlab, we broke each p53 trajectory into 5 hour time windows. Within each time
window cells were binned according to their maximum integrated p53 levels during that
time window. We then determined the proportion of cells in each bin that enacted apoptosis
during the experiment and divided this by the total number of cells in each bin to determine
the percentage of apoptotic cells in each bin.
Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed 1× with PBS and flash frozen in ethanol and dry ice. RNA was extracted
using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance
at 260nm. RNA was converted to cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA kit (Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed with 8.4ng cDNA, 100nM primer and SYBR
green reagent (Applied Biosystems). Primers listed in the supplement.
Viability assays
Approximately 3000 cells were plated to each well of a 96 well plate. Drugs were added 24
hours later. 72 hours after drug treatment 100µl of Cell Titer-Glo® reagent (Promega) was
added to each well and luminescence was measured by a Victor2 plate reader (Perkin
Elmer).

chemotherapy treatment. p53 promotes the transcription of Mdm2, which binds p53 and tags
it for degradation. DNA damage activates kinases that disrupt the interaction between p53

fold changes of Bcl2 family genes measured as in 5A. (H) HCT116 cells treated with
cisplatin and 200nM ABT-263. (I,J) Single-cell traces of integrated p53 in response to (H)
cisplatin + 1µM LCL-161 and (I) cisplatin + 200nM ABT-263. Apoptotic cells are red,
surviving cells in blue. Dashed line represents the apoptotic threshold calculated by logistic
regression on the viability matrix in S8C and S8D and assessing the p53 levels required for
75% of cells to die. The accuracy of the apoptotic threshold was 75% for cisplatin +
LCL-161 and 68% for cisplatin + ABT-263. Error Bars represent the standard deviation.
*Significant P<.05. N.S. Not Significant, calculated by a t-test.

Cisplatin induces Caspase-8 dependent and independent apoptotic pathways. (A–D)
CellTiter-Glo® assays measured 72 hours after cisplatin treatment. (A) HCT116 (HCT) and
HCT116 caspase 8−/− (Casp8−) cells treated with cisplatin and 1µM LCL-161. (B) HCT116
cells treated with combinations of cisplatin, 1µM LCL-161 and 30µM Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).
(C) Caspase 8−/− treated with 30µM Necrostatin-1. (D) Caspase-8−/− cells transfected with
CMV driven GFP, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP or ML-IAP for 24 hours before cisplatin treatment.
Data is normalized to untreated transfected cells. (E) Average log2 fold changes of IAP
genes in HCT116 and HCT116 p53−/− cells 72 hours after 12.5µM cisplatin treatment. (F)
