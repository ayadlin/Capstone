BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation is the preferred treatment for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer. Higher
doses of chemotherapy yielded promising results in vitro and vivo, confirmed by intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin-based
chemoradiation in phase 2 studies. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with (functionally) unresectable
head and neck cancer were included, from 2000 to 2004, in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, comparing IA
and intravenous chemoradiation. Intravenous chemoradiation comprised 3100 mg/m2 cisplatin infusion on Days 1,
22, 43 combined with 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions. The IA chemoradiation treatment arm comprised 4x150 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in the tumor-feeding artery on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, immediately followed by systemic rescue with sodium thiosulfate with the same radiotherapeutic regimen. RESULTS: Two patients were excluded from analysis
because of nontreatment-related death immediately after randomization (n ¼ 1) and esophageal carcinoma (n ¼ 1).
The median follow-up was 33 months 1-104 months. Ninety percent of the patients required tube feeding during
treatment. Renal toxicity >grade 2 was 9% in the intravenous compared with 1% in the IA treatment arm (P  .0001).
There was no difference in locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), between the
treatment arms. At 3 years, local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS was .76, .63, .44, .51 in the IA versus .70,
.65, .47, .47 in the intravenous treatment arm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation was
not superior to intravenous chemoradiation for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer regarding locoregional conC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Chemoradiation is the current standard for advanced unresectable head and neck carcinomas. Results exceed
those for radiation alone, favoring concomitant chemoradiation with a locoregional control rate of 50% to 70%.1 There’s
widespread experience with concomitant intravenous cisplatin-based chemoradiation. With 30%-50% locoregional failure and poor rescue possibilities, there is, however, still need for improvement. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that radiation with higher cisplatin dose results in higher cisplatin adduct formation, cell kill, and tumor
control.2,3 Exploring on this idea, Robbins et al developed the intra-arterial (IA) administration of high dose cisplatin in
combination with a conventional radiation schedule.4,5 By using the Seldinger technique via the femoral artery, cisplatin
was delivered either in the external carotid artery or a derived vessel feeding the primary tumor. The administration of cisplatin was then followed by systemic rescue through intravenously administered sodium thiosulphate, a covalent binder of
cisplatin, allowing for increased renal clearance and, thus, lower renal toxicity.4 With this technique, the total dose of

cisplatin could be increased from a standard 300 mg/m2
in 7 weeks to 600 mg/m2 in 4 weeks, all combined with
radiation, 70 Gy in 7 weeks, 35 fractions.
Reports on the results of this technique were promising, with an initial local control of around 90%.4 This led to
a phase 2 trial on IA cisplatin chemoradiation for anatomically and/or functionally unresectable head and neck cancer
in our institute.6 The complete local and regional response
rates were 91% and 90%, respectively, with a locoregional
control of 69% at 2 years. Side effects were substantial, with
38% grades 3 and 4 hematological toxicity, 57% tube feeding, but 0% renal toxicity.6 A phase 3 trial comparing conventional radiation with either intravenous or IA cisplatin
administration for (functionally) unresectable head and neck
cancer was started in 2000. In the same period, 121 patients
not eligible for or refusing the abovementioned phase 3 trial
at the Netherlands Cancer Institute were treated with daily
cisplatin chemoradiation (20-25 administrations of 6 mg/
m2 1 hour before radiation).7

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion criteria were as follows: squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, or hypopharynx,
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system
stage IV, T3-T4, any N classification, M0; performance
status: World Health Organization (WHO) 0-1, calculated creatinine clearance 50 mL/min, no previous
malignancies, cerebrovascular accident, or use of anticoagulants. The primary tumor needed to be anatomically
unresectable or functionally unresectable, ie, resection
requiring a total glossectomy. Pretreatment evaluation
comprised physical examination, Connecticut/MRI scan
of the head and neck region, chest x-ray, ultrasound fineneedle aspiration-guided cytology of the neck nodes, and
laboratory investigations (Hb, Ht, leukocytes, platelets,
creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine
aminotransferase (ALAT), alkaline phosphatase). Fineneedle aspiration-guided cytology was performed in case
of a lymph node larger than 5 mm shortest axis or thickened cortex of the lymph node. In case of multiple nodes,
the most prominent lymph node on each side was aspirated. Lymph nodes were considered involved if the cytology was positive or if a lymph node was clearly clinically
enlarged, irrespective of the cytology. In case of multiple
suspicious nodes on one side and one positive cytology,
the other nodes were considered positive as well.
All nodal areas (bilateral levels II-IV and level I in
case of oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors) and primary
tumors, were irradiated to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 frac-

tions a week, immediately followed by a boost of 24 Gy in
12 fractions to all involved areas including the primary tumor (total dose 70 Gy). Chemotherapy comprised cisplatin 100 mg/m2, administered intravenously on treatment
Days 1, 22 and 43 or cisplatin 150 mg/m2 administered
intra-arterially on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22. The sodium thiosulphate was given as a IV bolus of 9 g/m2 over 15-20
minutes, concurrently after each IA cisplatin administration, followed by a 12 g/m2 sodium thiosulphate IV continuous infusion over 6 hours.4
All patients randomized for IA cisplatin administration underwent a pretreatment arteriography. In case of
nonfeasibility, the patient was treated according to the intravenous protocol. Statistical analysis was based on the
principle of the intention to treat. In case of IA cisplatin
administration, the infusion was preferably single-sided
but was switched to double-sided if tumor invasion was 1
cm or more across the anatomical midline. Cisplatin
administration was then equally distributed between the 2
sides, irrespective of the portion of the tumor crossing the
midline. The trial protocol registered under number
CKTO 2000-2001/M99rad was judged and approved by
the local ethics committee, and patients signed informed
consents before treatment. Patient and tumor characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Randomization was stratified by center, T classification, N classification, and site of the primary tumor. Five
institutions participated in this trial. The trial was
designed to detect a difference in locoregional control
(primary endpoint) of 15% (from 60% to 75%) between
the treatment arms, which required 100 events for 80%.
With an accrual of 50-70 patients per year and a total of
240 patients, the required number of events was expected
within 1 year after closure of the trial. The total time of
accrual was 3 years and 11 months.
Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival
(DFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of life. The latter
is reported elsewhere.8 Toxicity was reported using Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0.9 Follow-up was weekly
during treatment, every 6 weeks for the first half year after
treatment, every 3 months for the first 2 years, and twice a
year thereafter.
Primary tumor volume assessment was performed
by delineation of the gross target volume, which included
all visible tumor on digitally available pretreatment MRI
or CT scans. All images were transferred to our workstation (Worldmatch Workstation), developed in-house, in
DICOM format for three-domensional computation of
tumor volume.

Most patients (160 patients) were treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute; other institutions that contributed
are as follows: Free University Hospital (12 patients),
Medisch Centrum Haaglanden (33 patients), Radiation
Institute Friesland (12 patients), Waikato Hospital (5
patients). All participating centers first performed the IA
procedure on 5 patients before entering patients in the
trial. Categorical variables were compared by treatment
using chi-square tests, or if cell counts fewer than 5
occurred, the Fisher exact test was used. Continuous variables were compared using the rank sum Wilcoxon test.

Local control, locoregional control, and DFS were
calculated from the time of randomization until diagnosis
of a local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, new tumor, death, loss to follow-up or end of followup, whichever came first. Patients with distant metastasis,
new tumor, or death as the first event were censored at
that time as well as patients lost to follow-up or event-free
at the end of follow-up. For calculation of local control,
patients with regional recurrence were censored as well.
OS was the time from randomization until death,
loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up, whichever came
first. Patients alive at end of follow-up or lost to follow-up
were censored at that time, respectively.
Disease-specific survival and metastasis-free survival
were calculated accordingly.
Survival times were compared by treatment arm
using the log-rank test as well as univariate and Cox multivariate proportional hazards regression with time from
randomization as the time scale and stratification for center (5 categories). Continuous variables were appropriately categorized, and trend tests were based on the
significance of the slope for the continuous variable.
Effect modification was evaluated by estimating separate treatment effects for each category of a potential
effect modifier, while adjusting for its main effect and
comparing the goodness of fit with the null model including one overall treatment effect via likelihood ratio methods. The assumption of proportional hazards was
evaluated by adding interaction terms with follow-up
time and the logarithm of follow-up time.

final analysis: 1 died directly after randomization of an
unrelated cause, the other because of an erroneous inclusion of esophageal carcinoma as primary tumor.
There was no evidence of differences in the distribution
of the following variables by treatment arm: center, T classification, N classification, site, tumor extension across midline,
WHO performance status, gender, tumor volume, age at
randomization (P > .3) (See also Table 1 A, B).
Compliance was defined as complete delivery of
both radiation and chemotherapy within the planned
treatment time. Overall compliance in the IA treatment
arm was 76%. Ninety patients completed treatment as
planned and 10 patients received intravenous chemoradiation because of impossibility of the IA procedure.
Eleven patients received less than 3 IA cisplatin courses. In
the intravenous chemoradiation treatment arm, 96 (81%)
patients received all 3 intended cisplatin courses, and 11
patients received less than 2 courses. All patients received
the full radiation treatment of 70 Gy in 7 weeks.
Side Effects
Side effects per treatment arm are summarized in Table 2.
Only 6 patients and 13% in the IA and intravenous treatment arm, respectively, of all 221 patients for whom this
was documented managed the entire treatment without
tube feeding. The remainder, 50% and 39%, respectively,
needed tube feeding before start of treatment, ie, the swallowing disorder was caused by tumor. Renal toxicity >grade
2 was significantly lower in the IA treatment arm, 1% versus
9% (P ¼ <.0001). Hematological toxicity >grade 2 was
52% versus 42% (not significant). One patient was left with
irreversible renal damage but without persistent dialysis
need. Mucosal and ototoxicity defined as a hearing loss of
more than 5 dB on audiogram were 50% versus 54% and
53% versus 58%, respectively. Cardiac and pulmonary toxicity combined was less prevalent in the IA treatment arm
with 5 versus 9 patients (ns). In the IA treatment arm, 1
patient died of pneumonia and 1 additional patient received
3 cisplatin courses because of sepsis. In the intravenous
treatment arm, 3 patients died during treatment, and 1
patient did not receive the last course because of cardiac
morbidity. Neurological toxicity >grade 2, ie, transient ischemic attacks, was more prevalent in the IA treatment arm
(n ¼ 8) than in the intravenous treatment arm (n ¼ 1,
P ¼ .005). One patient had a cerebrovascular accident with
full recovery (IA chemoradiation). Because of neurological
toxicity, 5 patients received <4 courses of IA chemotherapy,
and the 1 patient in the intravenous treatment arm received
full course chemoradiation.

Treatment Outcome
Outcome

The median follow-up was 33 months (Table 1).
During follow-up, among 237 patients, 57 recurred
locally, 35 recurred regionally, and 79 recurred locoregionally. There were 25 new primary tumors, 63 distant
metastases (all as first events), and 140 deaths. Of the latter, 60 deaths were because of the underlying cancer and
the remainder because of intercurrent disease. A total of
163 patients had at least 1 of the events listed.
Overall complete response rates were 92% and 79%
for intravenous and IA treatment, respectively. At 3 years,
local control, locoregional control, DFS, disease-specific
survival, distant metastasis survival, and OS were nonsignificantly different (Table 3, Fig. 1). A univariate comparison
of event times showed no evidence of heterogeneity by
treatment arm (log-rank test, P ¼ .61, .72, .94, .57, .51,
and .41, respectively). Multivariate locoregional control
comparisons based on a proportional hazards regression
stratified for center and adjusted for site, N classification,
and T classification showed similar results (hazard ration
[HR], .74, .95, 1.01, 1.14, 1.33, and .87; P ¼ .28, .84, .94,
.63, .28, and .44, respectively) (Table 4). For suspected residual regional disease on clinical or radiological grounds,
21 neck dissections were performed; in 3 of those, microscopic viable tumor was found in the neck dissection specimen but total removal was achieved, and the remainder 18
had no tumor in the specimen.
Local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS
were significantly associated with tumor volume. Patients
with relatively large tumors (>30 mL) had worse local control (HR, 3.10; P ¼ .0017), locoregional control (HR,
2.16; P ¼ .0067), DFS (HR, 1.92; P ¼ .0025), and OS
(HR, 2.36; P ¼ .0001) compared with those with tumors
30 mL. Locoregional control, DFS, distant metastasisfree survival, and OS were significantly associated with N
classification. DFS, local control, DFS, and distant metastasis-free survival were significantly associated with T classification. Tumor volume was not always digitally available (31
of 119 patients in the intravenous treatment arm and 18 of
118 patients in the IA treatment arm). It was, therefore, not
included in further analyses unless explicitly mentioned.
Effects of treatment modality by site, tumor size,
extension across the midline, and compliance

There was no evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect by site (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
P > .2). For the 4 main outcomes and patients in the IA
treatment arm, better survival was associated with tumors

not extending across the midline, ie, unilateral versus
bilateral infusion (4 missing). The effect was not dependent on tumor volume. We subsequently assessed tumor
extension across the midline for patients in the intravenous treatment arm (15 missing) and found no worse survival for tumors extending across the midline.
Most of the primary tumors (151 of 237) were crossing the anatomical midline by 1 cm or more. Local conTable 3. Control and Survival Rates at 3 Years by Treatment

trol was significantly better in the IA versus the
intravenous treatment arm among patients whose tumor
did not extend across the midline (HR, .21; 95% confidence interval [CI], .07-.68; P ¼ .0055), whereas it was
nonsignificantly worse for patients whose tumor did
extend across the midline (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, .66-2.94).
The benefit from IA treatment was limited to the 14 of 26
patients (of 237 treated patients) with a relatively large tumor not extending across the midline (HR, .18, 95% CI,
.04-.75), while no significant benefit was observed in the
remaining 3 groups. Similar but slightly more pronounced patterns of heterogeneity were observed for overall (P ¼ .0068) and DFS (P ¼ .0031), whereas
corresponding risk estimates for locoregional control and
DFS were generally consistent but substantially attenuated. Tumor volume and extension across the midline
were correlated (Wilcoxon test, P ¼ .0065). However,
there was considerable discordance with about 50% of
patients having small tumors (volume 30 mL) extending

Results were not substantially different when the

There was no evidence of nonproportional hazards (P >

for IA treatment versus intravenous treatment decreased

DISCUSSION
This is the first multi-institutional randomized phase 3
trial comparing IA and intravenous chemoradiation in
advanced (functionally) unresectable head and neck cancer. Despite a 2-fold increase in total cisplatin dose, IA cisplatin chemoradiation is not superior to intravenous
cisplatin chemoradiation.
The compliance in this trial was satisfactory in both
treatment arms, ie, only 11 of 120 patients randomized to

2164

intravenous treatment received less than 2 courses and
80% received all 3 intended intravenous cisplatin courses
without delay.1,10-12 All patients received the intended
radiation course without delay. IA chemoradiation led to
more cerebrovascular side effects because of the IA catheterization. The addition of sodium thiosulphate resulted
in similar bone marrow toxicity, nausea, and ototoxicity
in both treatment arms despite a 2-fold higher cisplatin
administration in the IA treatment. The renal toxicity was
significantly lower in the IA treatment arm. These findings indicate that the sodium thiosulfate-based neutralization of cisplatin is effective. Other side effects were not
different between the treatment arms. Side effects were
similar to earlier published chemoradiation results and
considerable in both treatment arms.1,6,13
It is not clear why tumor control was not superior in
the high dose IA treatment despite superselective cisplatin
delivery. Antitumor effectiveness of cisplatin is correlated
with the cisplatin adduct formation in the (tumor) cell.
Van der Vaart reported a significant correlation of cisplatin adduct formation in buccal cells and tumor control in
lung cancer.2 Hoebers et al investigated the cisplatin
adduct formation in intra-arterially treated patients but
found no difference in intratumoral adduct formation
between intravenously treated and intra-arterially treated
patients despite a difference between various intravenous
schedules with increasing cisplatin dose.14 One would
expect a higher intratumoral adduct formation in intraarterially treated patients, because not only did the total
amount of cisplatin increase 2-fold (3100 vs 4150
mg/m2), but also the direct local exposure of the tumor to
cisplatin increased considerably, up to a factor of 200,3
which is directly related to immediate replacement of arterial blood flow to the tumor by a cisplatin solution for 3-5
minutes. The reason for no increase in adduct formation
is unclear but may explain the negative result of this trial.
Another explanation for the negative result could be
the number of double-sided IA infusions. In the preceding
phase 2 trial in our institute, unilateral infusion was superior to bilateral infusion.15 Similar to other reports on IA
chemoradiation, patients with a tumor extending more
than 1 cm across the anatomical midline were treated with
double-sided infusion.16 As a result, 58% of our IA
patients received double-sided infusion with the same
total dose of 150 mg/m2. This is a higher percentage than
reported by Robbins et al.4-5, 16-19. Because the criteria for
bilateral infusion were more strict in our study compared
with the RTOG 9615 study, this is most likely because of
more tumors crossing the midline in our study group.16

Intra-arterial Versus Intravenous CRT/Rasch et al

This can be explained by the selection of patients for
(functional) inoperable tumors in our study as opposed to
stage IV tumors, in general, with consequentially more
tumors crossing the midline in our study. In an
unplanned subgroup analysis, we found that there was a
significantly higher local and locoregional control rate
and DFS for IA treatment for large (>30 mL) lateralized
tumors, whereas there was a nonsignificantly poorer outcome for smaller tumors and bilateral infusion. This suggests that IA chemoradiation plays a role in the treatment
of large lateralized tumors amendable for unilateral infusion, ie, not extending the anatomical midline for more
than 1 cm. However, in our series, this would be only 26
of 239 patients and the subgroup analysis was not
planned. Nevertheless, patients with tumors crossing the
midline could have had the disadvantage of diluted cisplatin administration. From this study, it cannot be determined if those patients would have benefited from
undiluted, unilateral infusion.
Both treatments, therefore, performed equally well,
with different but comparable toxicity and, lethal toxicity
(2 vs 3 patients) was also not different.
Conclusion
Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation is not superior to intravenous chemoradiation. Quality of life12 and degree of
toxicity, including lethal toxicity, were similar, although
the site of toxicity differed. Therefore, none of the treatments can be advised as standard treatment on the basis of
the results of this trial.
