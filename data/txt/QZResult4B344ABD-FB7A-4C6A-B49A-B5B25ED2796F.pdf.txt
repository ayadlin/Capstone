Abstract
Many promising new cancer drugs proceed through preclinical
testing and early-phase trials only to fail in late-stage clinical
testing. Thus, improved models that better predict survival outcomes and enable the development of biomarkers are needed to
identify patients most likely to respond to and beneﬁt from
therapy. Here, we describe a comprehensive approach in which
we incorporated biobanking, xenografting, and multiplexed
phospho-ﬂow (PF) cytometric proﬁling to study drug response
and identify predictive biomarkers in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) patients. To test the efﬁcacy of our approach, we evaluated
the investigational JAK2 inhibitor fedratinib (FED) in 64 patient
samples. FED robustly reduced leukemia in mouse xenograft
models in 59% of cases and was also effective in limiting the
protumorigenic activity of leukemia stem cells as shown by
serial transplantation assays. In parallel, PF proﬁling identiﬁed

Introduction
Historically, improvements in long-term survival of cancer
patients due to new therapeutic approaches have been incremental. Promising preclinical studies or early-phase clinical trials
frequently do not translate into survival beneﬁts in phase III trials

FED-mediated reduction in phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) levels as a
predictive biomarker of in vivo drug response with high speciﬁcity
(92%) and strong positive predictive value (93%). Unexpectedly,
another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib (RUX), was ineffective in 8 of
10 FED-responsive samples. Notably, this outcome could be
predicted by the status of pSTAT5 signaling, which was unaffected by RUX treatment. Consistent with this observed discrepancy, PF analysis revealed that FED exerted its effects
through multiple JAK2-independent mechanisms. Collectively,
this work establishes an integrated approach for testing novel
anticancer agents that captures the inherent variability
of response caused by disease heterogeneity and in parallel,
facilitates the identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers that
can help stratify patients into appropriate clinical trials. Cancer

(1), implying that traditional preclinical models and endpoints in
early-phase trials are insufﬁcient surrogates for predicting longterm outcomes. Moreover, the mechanistic basis for variable
treatment responses in clinical trials is often unknown and can
result in rejection of a drug that may be of beneﬁt to a subset of
patients. Thus, a re-examination of traditional drug development
models and parallel identiﬁcation of drug response biomarkers
for patient selection are required in order to improve the success
rate in bringing forward new effective oncologic drugs.
Current preclinical models seldom reﬂect the disease state
within humans. For example, new drugs are frequently screened
for their antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines in vitro.
However, cell lines and in vitro cultures do not fully capture the
intrinsic and extrinsic diversity of human disease. Moreover,
proliferation in culture measures drug effects on the bulk population and not the cancer stem cells (CSC), which in many tumors
have been linked to therapy failure and disease recurrence (2).
Tumor heterogeneity is also not well modeled by (frequently
nonorthotopic) injection of human cancer cell lines into mice, or
even by engineered mouse models; the low variability and good
reproducibility of the latter are actually disadvantageous for drug
testing as they do not reﬂect intratumor and interpatient heterogeneity (3, 4). Xenotransplantation of primary cancer cells is
currently the best functional assay for both normal and malignant
adult human stem cells, and in the context of human acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) reads out clinically relevant properties

Primary Xenografting Reveals Novel Response Biomarkers

of repopulating cells (5–7). Numerous previous studies have
evaluated the efﬁcacy of antileukemia drugs in the setting of
xenotransplantation assays (8–12); however, the number of primary patient samples tested has generally been small, thus precluding biomarker development.
Here, we describe a comprehensive approach that combines
drug testing of a large cohort of primary patient samples in
xenotransplantation assays with parallel phospho-ﬂow (PF) cytometric single-cell proﬁling of short-term drug responsiveness
in vitro to develop companion drug response biomarkers. To test
this approach, we studied the efﬁcacy of fedratinib (FED, also
known as SAR302503 or TG101348), an investigational Janus
kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, against leukemia stem cells (LSC) in
AML. JAK2 inhibitors including ruxolitinib (RUX) and FED have
demonstrated efﬁcacy in clinical trials for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN; refs. 13–15), but have not been
employed in AML, where activating JAK2 mutations are rare.
Nevertheless, downstream STAT transcription factors are activated
in the majority of AML cases (16, 17). Furthermore, high levels of
phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) expression have been associated
with worse outcome in AML, and in vitro studies suggest that JAK2
could be a therapeutic target in this disease (18). We demonstrate
here that our approach effectively captures the variability in
treatment response that is generally seen in patient cohorts and
allowed identiﬁcation of a PF signature that correlated with drug
responses in xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Xenotransplantation assay and drug studies
Xenotransplantation and in vivo drug treatment experiments
were carried out in Toronto (T) and Vancouver (V) using local
optimized protocols. Employed protocols yielded similar engraftment results at both sites for patient samples tested in pilot
studies. NOD.SCID (NS) and NOD.SCID-IL2Rg null (NSG) mice
were bred and housed at the University Health Network (UHN)
Animal Facility (T) or the BC Cancer Research Centre Animal
Resource Centre (V). Eight- to 10-week-old mice were sublethally
irradiated (T: 225 cGy; V-NS: 325 cGy; V-NSG: 315 cGy) 24 hours
before transplantation. NS mice (T) received 200 mg anti-CD122
mAb by subcutaneous injection immediately after irradiation. For
NSG experiments, T-cell depletion was carried out by treating
mice with 12.5 mg/kg anti–CD3-diphtheria toxin by i.p. injection
24 hours after AML transplantation for 2 consecutive days (V), or
by using the EasySep CD3 Positive Selection Kit (StemCell Technologies) prior to intrafemoral (IF) transplantation (T). AML
samples were injected IF except for two Vancouver samples that
were transplanted intravenously as indicated in Table 1. AML
samples were transplanted at a dose of 2 to 5  106 cells/mouse.
Treatment with FED (Sanoﬁ) or RUX (Selleck Chemicals), both at
a dose of 60 mg/kg, or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) was given
twice daily by oral gavage for 14 days starting 2 to 3 weeks after
transplantation. For serial transplantation studies, equal numbers
of human CD45þ cells harvested from the pooled bone marrow of
FED-treated or vehicle-treated mice were injected into untreated
secondary recipients and engraftment evaluated 10 to 12 weeks
after transplantation. For cytarabine combination studies, mice
were treated with cytarabine 80 mg/kg/d i.p. 5 days prior to FED
or vehicle treatment. For DAS combination studies, mice received
60 mg/kg FED twice daily, 50 mg/kg DAS once daily, or both for 2
weeks by oral gavage. For all drug studies, mice were sacriﬁced the

day after the ﬁnal dose, and the level of human leukemic engraftment in the injected femur and noninjected bones (other femur
plus two tibias) was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry using humanspeciﬁc mAbs (for details, see Supplementary Methods).
Deﬁnition of drug response for xenotransplantation studies
For in vivo drug studies, deﬁnition of response was based on the
relative reduction (RR) in human leukemic engraftment in drugtreated versus vehicle-treated mice. RR was calculated as [(mean%engraftment of vehicle-treated mice)  (mean%engraftment of
drug-treated mice)]/(mean%engraftment of vehicle-treated mice).
We distinguished effects in the injected right femur (RF) versus
noninjected bones (BM) as leukemic burden is usually higher in
the injected RF, and as such a signiﬁcant reduction in leukemic
engraftment in the RF is more difﬁcult to achieve than in noninjected BM. Patients were classiﬁed as responders (R) if RR in the
RF was >50%, partial responders (PR) if we observed 20% to 50%
RR in the RF or >20% RR in the BM only, and nonresponders (NR)
if there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in engraftment
levels between vehicle- and drug-treated mice or RR was <20% in
both RF and BM.
PF cytometric analysis
AML patient samples tested in vivo were subjected to PF analysis
following short-term drug treatment in vitro. Viably frozen samples were thawed and serum starved for 1 hour at 37 C, then
treated with DMSO (vehicle), FED (100 nmol/L), AC220 (5
nmol/L; Selleck Chemicals), RUX (300 nmol/L), or DAS (100–
200 nmol/L; Toronto Research Chemicals) for another hour.
During the last 30 m, cells were incubated with viability dye,
then ﬁxed, washed, and permeabilized. Phosphomarker and
extracellular staining was carried out for 30' with optimized
concentrations of antibodies (for details, see Supplementary
Methods). Data were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa and analyzed
using FlowJo and Cytobank software (http://cytobank.org/;
ref. 19). Ba/F3 cells were obtained from R. Rottapel in 2006. This
IL3-dependent hematopoietic cell line remains exquisitely IL3
dependent for survival and proliferation, as assessed by cell
viability assays following IL3 withdrawal (ongoing). OCI-AML5
cells were obtained from M.D. Minden in 2010. This patientderived AML cell line was authenticated by short-tandem repeats
analysis in 2014 at the Centre for Applied Genomics (Hospital for
Sick Children, Toronto, Canada).
Statistical analysis
Sixty-four independent patient samples were used in the study
to capture the diversity of AML. Comparison of engraftment in
drug- versus vehicle-treated mice was performed using two-tailed t
tests. For PF analysis, two-group comparisons were performed
using the Mann–Whitney U test. Correlations were assessed by
two-tailed Spearman correlation. All data were analyzed with
GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0, for Mac OS X.
Study approval
Peripheral blood cells were collected from patients with newly
diagnosed or relapsed AML at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre
or Vancouver General Hospital after obtaining informed consent
according to procedures approved by the UHN and University of
British Columbia (UBC) Research Ethics Boards. Thawed viably
frozen samples were prescreened for engraftment ability in

Results
FED targets LSCs in primary AML xenografts with
heterogeneous responses
We tested the potential efﬁcacy of FED in AML in an initial
cohort of 34 patient samples obtained at diagnosis or relapse and
representing multiple cytogenetic and molecular subtypes (Supplementary Table S1). Samples were transplanted into cohorts of
immune-deﬁcient mice (n ¼ 5–8/group); following a 2- to 3-week
engraftment period, mice were treated with FED or vehicle control
for another 2 weeks (Fig. 1A). For 17 of 34 samples, leukemic
engraftment in the injected femurs was 56% to 94% lower in
FED-treated relative to vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.05, Table 1
and Fig. 1B). These samples also showed a 30% to 95% RR in
leukemic engraftment of noninjected bones (P < 0.05). Five additional samples responded less robustly (<50% RR in injected femur
and 31%–64% RR in noninjected bones; P < 0.05; Table 1). These
22 samples were classiﬁed as xenograft responders (X-R). By contrast, FED had a small or negligible effect on the leukemic graft in 12

1216 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

of 34 samples (<20% RR, P < 0.05 or any RR, P > 0.05); these were
classiﬁed as xenograft nonresponders (X-NR; Table 1 and Fig. 1C).
We also evaluated whether treatment with a standard agent
such as cytarabine could potentiate the effects of FED, using
samples from 3 AML patients that were partial- or nonresponders
to FED alone (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In 2 of 3 samples tested,
cytarabineþFED treatment signiﬁcantly reduced leukemia burden
in treated mice compared with either drug alone (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). These ﬁndings suggest that combining the targeted
therapeutic FED with cytarabine may increase overall efﬁcacy.
To evaluate whether FED targets LSCs, AML cells were harvested
from primary mice and transplanted into untreated secondary
recipients; two X-NR and seven X-R samples were evaluable (cells
from vehicle-treated primary mice generated >10% mean engraftment levels in secondary mice). For the two X-NR samples, the
FED-treated and control groups yielded similar engraftment levels
in secondary mice (Fig. 1D, left and Supplementary Fig. S1C). By
contrast, in ﬁve of seven X-R samples, the FED-treated group gave
rise to smaller grafts compared with controls (Fig. 1D, right and
Supplementary Fig. S1C), although this only reached statistical
signiﬁcance in two samples due to small numbers of transplanted
mice. These results suggest that in responding samples, FED
treatment may impair the function and/or survival of LSCs
exposed to drug in the primary mice, although variable sensitivity

was observed as in the primary mice. Overall, by testing a large
cohort of patient samples in a clinically relevant model, we
evaluated drug effects against LSCs and captured the heterogeneous treatment response that is often seen in clinical trials.
FED-sensitive pSTAT5 provides a biomarker of in vivo response
to FED
Given the observed heterogeneity of response in xenograft
assays, we sought to identify a biomarker of FED responsiveness.
As FED is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we used a multiplexed PF
cytometry assay (20) to proﬁle, with single-cell resolution, the
impact of short-term (30–600 ) in vitro FED treatment on the
basal activity of the SYK, BCR, JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K/mTOR,
and NF-kB signaling pathways in primary AML blasts (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). We used 100 nmol/L FED in these
studies, because this concentration greatly reduced IL3-induced
STAT5 phosphorylation in the FLT3L-responsive OCI-AML5 cell
line (Supplementary Fig. S2D). As expected (5), the AML samples in this cohort displayed highly variable expression of CD34,
CD45, CD123, and CD33 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
Therefore, we costained each sample with antibodies directed
against these markers to evaluate signaling in immunophenotypic cell subsets within individual samples. Basal levels of
MAPK p38, pSTAT5, pAKT(T), pSRC, and IkBa showed the
highest variance across this cohort (Fig. 2A, top). As would be
expected, a 600 treatment with FED in vitro decreased basal levels
of pSTAT5 to a greater extent than other phosphoproteins
(Fig. 2A, bottom). Interestingly, not all samples with high basal
pSTAT5 levels were FED-responsive in the PF assay (R2 ¼ 0.54),
but samples with the highest basal levels of pSTAT5 showed the
greatest FED-mediated decrease in pSTAT5 (Supplementary Fig.
S3C). In most cases, only a fraction of the AML blast population
showed elevated basal pSTAT5; the level of CD34 expression on
pSTAT5hi cells was highly variable (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Thus, we identiﬁed considerable signaling heterogeneity within
and between AML samples in the cohort.
By comparing the in vivo drug response and PF data for each
patient sample, we found that basal pSTAT5 levels were signiﬁcantly higher in X-R compared with X-NR samples (Fig. 2B). FED
treatment also led to a signiﬁcantly greater decrease in basal
pSTAT5 levels in X-R relative to X-NR samples (Fig. 2B), suggesting
that the PF assay represents a biomarker of AML responsiveness to
FED in vivo. This conclusion was supported by unsupervised
clustering and heatmap analysis of FED-mediated decreases in
basal levels of 12 phosphoproteins, which divided the cohort into
two major groups (Fig. 2C). One cluster contained primarily X-R
samples (14/15) that showed robust FED-mediated decreases in
pSTAT5 [0.47 to 2.78 fold change (FC), log2 scale]; there were
inconsistent but signiﬁcant decreases in several other phosphoproteins in this sample cluster following FED treatment. The
second cluster contained a mixture of X-R and X-NR samples
where FED treatment did not cause changes in the measured
phosphoproteins. Considering all of the X-R samples in this initial
patient cohort, 64% (14/22) exhibited 0.4-fold (log2) FEDmediated decrease in pSTAT5 (Supplementary Fig. S3E), whereas
the remaining X-R samples lacked this biomarker, suggesting at
least two different mechanisms of response to FED. Importantly,
92% (11/12) of X-NR samples did not show loss of pSTAT5 when
treated with FED. This assay thus provides a highly speciﬁc
predictor of treatment sensitivity to FED in vivo with high-positive
predictive value (14/15 ¼ 93%).

1218 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

To conﬁrm these ﬁndings, we tested the suitability of FEDsensitive decrease in pSTAT5 as a biomarker of in vivo response to
FED in an independent validation cohort of 30 additional AML
patient samples. In this cohort, 16 and 14 samples were classiﬁed
as X-R and X-NR, respectively, based on RR of leukemic engraftment in treated xenotransplanted mice (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4). A FED-mediated reduction in pSTAT5 signaling was
observed in 9 of 16 X-R and was absent in 12 of 14 X-NR patients,
giving a sensitivity of 56% and speciﬁcity of 86% for this response
biomarker in the validation cohort. Collectively, these data indicate that FED-sensitive pSTAT5 may provide a phosphoproteomic
biomarker to identify AML patients whose leukemia cells are
unlikely to respond to FED treatment in the in vivo model.
To examine whether the effects of FED against LSCs in AML
were indeed mediated by JAK2 inhibition, we tested the efﬁcacy of
RUX, a JAK1/2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of MPNs,
against 10 AML samples classiﬁed as FED X-R. Surprisingly, eight
of ten samples did not respond to RUX treatment in xenograft
assays, and the remaining two showed only a partial response
(Fig. 3A and Table 3). Furthermore, in vitro treatment with RUX
had minimal or no impact on pSTAT5 levels, in marked contrast
with strong FED-mediated effects. As cytokine-induced JAK2
activation is accompanied by autophosphorylation of Y1007 and
Y1008 (Fig. 3B; ref. 21), we also examined the abundance of
pJAK2Y1007/Y1008 in samples from both cohorts. Interestingly,
when detected, pJAK2 was predominantly expressed in CD34
CD45hi AML blasts, and levels were not affected by in vitro
treatment with FED (Fig. 3C). Samples with FED-sensitive pSTAT5
either had little pJAK2 (Fig. 3C, AML43), or expressed pJAK2 and
pSTAT5 in phenotypically distinct cellular subsets (Fig. 3C,
AML50), suggesting that STAT5 phosphorylation was JAK2 independent in most cases. Finally, samples with the highest basal
pJAK2 typically had low pSTAT5 (Fig. 3C, AML53), suggesting that
pJAK2 did not induce STAT5 phosphorylation in these samples.
Collectively, these data suggest that FED exerts its effects in AML
primarily through JAK2-independent mechanisms.
Although FED was developed as a JAK2 inhibitor, like all other
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it has signiﬁcant effects on other
tyrosine kinases. Speciﬁcally, FED also inhibits FLT3 (Supplementary Fig. S5A; ref. 22), albeit with 5-fold lower potency (23).
Therefore, we examined whether the observed FED effects
might be mediated by FLT3 inhibition, because activating
FLT3-ITD mutations are common in AML. In accordance with
studies showing that FLT3-ITD causes STAT5 activation (24),
basal pSTAT5 levels were signiﬁcantly higher in FLT3-ITDþ compared with FLT3-ITD AML samples (Supplementary Fig. S5B), as
previously reported (25). Treatment in vitro with the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 or FED decreased pSTAT5 to a greater extent in FLT3ITDþ samples (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). Nonetheless,
FED also robustly decreased pSTAT5 levels in 3 FLT3-ITD AML
samples (Supplementary Fig. S5C), and 15/38 X-R samples lacked
FLT3-ITD (Supplementary Fig. S5D). These data argue that in vitro
and in vivo responses to FED are not restricted to FLT3-ITDþ
samples.
Identiﬁcation of subpopulations with distinct pSRC/pSTAT5
signaling and drug sensitivity
Many AML samples from both cohorts exhibited small FEDmediated reductions in basal pSRC levels (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting that inhibition of SRC signaling
might partly account for FED's efﬁcacy in vivo. Indeed, prior

reports have suggested that several SRC family kinases are aberrantly activated in AML (26, 27). In vitro treatment with dasatanib
(DAS), a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, robustly decreased SRC
phosphorylation in our initial patient cohort (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, most AML samples contained phenotypically deﬁned cellular subsets that exhibited distinct signaling proﬁles, including a
discrete pSRChi subset that was typically CD45hiCD34/lo (Fig.
4B) and CD33hi (data not shown), and a pSTAT5hi subset that was
CD45lo (CD34þ or CD34). In most cases, pSTAT5 levels were
robustly decreased by in vitro treatment with FED but not DAS,
whereas pSRC was reduced to a greater extent by DAS than FED

(Fig. 4B). One exception was sample AML21, in which pSTAT5
and pSRC, although clearly present in different subsets, were both
more sensitive to inhibition by DAS than by FED (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Indeed, DAS treatment reduced global tyrosine phosphorylation in this sample; of note, this sample contains a BCRABL1 gene rearrangement. This unusual PF proﬁle was also
observed in six chronic phase CML samples tested (Supplementary Fig. S6 and data not shown).

prompted us to test the efﬁcacy of FEDþDAS combination
therapy in vivo with 3 patient samples (Fig. 4C–E and data not
shown). Response to single-agent therapy (either FED or DAS) in
xenotransplanted mice was concordant with drug sensitivity predicted by PF analysis of in vitro treatment effects (Fig. 4B and D),
and the combination of FEDþDAS was more effective in reducing
leukemic engraftment in treated mice compared with either agent
alone. In addition, although a limited number of mice were
tested, serial transplantation of AML8 (a relapse sample) suggested that combination therapy may more effectively impair LSC
function compared with the single agents (Fig. 4E). Thus, combining multiparameter PF analysis with in vivo drug testing of
primary patient samples enabled the rational design and evaluation of a combination regimen to target LSCs in an animal model
of AML.

Discussion
Here, we developed an approach that combines drug testing of
large numbers of primary patient samples with multiparameter PF
analysis. Using FED as a prototype, we demonstrated heterogeneity of treatment response in our xenograft model, with efﬁcacy
observed in 38 of 64 (59%) samples. In parallel, we identiﬁed a
drug response biomarker that predicts which patients are likely to
beneﬁt from FED treatment based on the responses observed in
xenografts. To date, this is the largest patient cohort tested with a
single drug. This scale of testing allowed inclusion of patients with

1220 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

refractory/relapsed disease and heterogeneous molecular and
cytogenetic abnormalities. The similar concordance of in vivo drug
response with PF response in Toronto and Vancouver points to the
robustness and feasibility of our approach for future preclinical
drug development in AML.
Although xenograft models are often employed in anticancer
drug development, timing and sample availability generally
preclude contemporaneous analysis of patients in a clinical trial
and xenografts derived from the same patients' samples, leading to uncertainty as to the validity of the latter for predicting
treatment response. In the absence of such paired analyses,
characterization of a predictive biomarker derived from xenograft treatment responses represents an ideal means to correlate
the heterogeneous responses seen in the two settings. Validation of predicted drug responses in patients would strongly
support the utility and applicability of large-scale xenografting
for preclinical drug development, which if carried out in parallel with studies to identify response biomarkers as described
here, will increase the success rate of anticancer drugs that
proceed to trial, especially for drugs that may be beneﬁcial to
only a subset of patients.
In the case of AML, this approach can only be applied to the
approximately 50% of patient samples that can generate xenografts using current methods, which may raise questions about the
universality of drug-testing results. However, AML patients whose
cells are engraftment-capable have worse outcomes (Kennedy and
colleagues; unpublished data; ref. 7), and thus are in greatest

need. Furthermore, there is substantive evidence that the properties of LSCs assayed in AML xenotransplant models have clinical
relevance across a broader set of samples beyond those that can
generate xenografts (5–7). For example, a functionally deﬁned
LSC-speciﬁc gene expression signature is highly prognostic in
multiple independent AML cohorts (5, 6), suggesting that common pathways that are operative within LSC-enriched (i.e., xenograft-initiating) cell fractions are linked to outcome in all patients.
This link also implies that, regardless of a patient's mutational
spectrum and even when the subclonal composition of a xenograft does not reﬂect the dominant leukemic clone in a patient
(28), the common stemness pathways that govern engrafting cells
represent potentially relevant therapeutic targets. Thus, drugs that
impair leukemic engraftment may affect outcomes, a possibility
that must ultimately be tested in clinical trials.

xenografts (distinct from primary patient samples) have been
used previously by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (29)
and others (30) to test a panel of therapeutic agents against a

screening potential new drugs, this approach does not capture

interpatient tumor heterogeneity nor allow for identiﬁcation of
drug response biomarkers. Furthermore, xenografts that have
been extensively propagated may not mirror the patient's tumor
accurately. The largest study in a single tumor type examined the

Primary Xenografting Reveals Novel Response Biomarkers

cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts (31). Fifty percent of
samples exhibited partial responses deﬁned by RECIST (32),
but only 5% of patients had a partial response at clinical trial
(33). The incongruence between success at preclinical stages
and failure in clinical trials seen in this and other studies may
be explained by the inability of previous preclinical models of
NSCLC and other tumors both to reﬂect disease heterogeneity
and to read out CSC function (2). Drugs that reduce tumor bulk
may not necessarily have activity against CSCs, and vice versa.
As evaluation of drug effects against CSCs in clinical trials is
challenging, it is important to evaluate CSC function in wellcharacterized preclinical models of human cancer, of which the
AML xenograft is the best example.
The use of a large number of primary AML samples in our
study enabled us to capture the response heterogeneity that is
commonly seen in the clinic. The mechanistic basis for variability in treatment responses in clinical trials is often unknown
but is likely related at least in part to disease heterogeneity
among patients. Both inter- and intrapatient tumor heterogeneity exist on functional and genetic levels, and cell lines or
even a small number of patient-derived xenografts do not
sufﬁciently capture this heterogeneity. This precludes identiﬁcation of response biomarkers and confounds efforts to understand mechanisms of action of candidate drugs and correlate
these to response. For example, treatment with AZD1480, an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK kinases, reduced leukemic
engraftment in xenograft studies of a small number of AML
samples (n ¼ 7; ref. 34). In vitro analysis of 48 AML samples
demonstrated inhibition of both pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in the
phenotypically deﬁned CD34þ LSC/progenitor blast population, but the degree of inhibition was quite variable
(0%–100%). Thus, it is difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions about
whether inhibition of pSTAT3/5 signaling is the critical mechanism by which AZD1480 mediates its in vivo effects against
LSCs. In our study, PF proﬁling provided some mechanistic
insights into how FED exerts its anti-LSC effects in vivo; speciﬁcally, that FED is not acting solely through inhibition of
JAK2 or FLT3 activity. Unexpectedly, we observed very few
in vivo responses to another JAK inhibitor (RUX), highlighting
the fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors usually have multiple
speciﬁcities (23), and that the mechanism of action against
LSCs may not be related to their most potent inhibitor activity.
The discordance between the in vivo and in vitro responses
observed with FED and RUX also demonstrates that response
biomarkers are likely tied to speciﬁc-drug actions and cannot be
extrapolated to a drug class. Parallel assessment of in vivo
response and in vitro analysis of affected pathways also provides
opportunity for uncovering drug synergy, as demonstrated here
for FEDþDAS.
Predictive response biomarkers are increasingly being sought
to guide patient selection in clinical trials to maximize the
chances of demonstrating true drug effectiveness. Even when
patients are selected for a trial based on the presence of a putative
drug target (mutation and/or pathway), variability in response
may be related to off-target effects, as seen in the current study,
and thus unpredictable. The drug-responsive pSTAT5 biomarker
that we identiﬁed based on correlation with treatment responses
in xenografts was highly speciﬁc (few false positives) with
strong positive predictive value in an independent validation
cohort. Although this biomarker correlated with FLT3-ITD
positivity, it also correctly predicted in vivo response to FED in

www.aacrjournals.org

3 FLT3-ITD xenografted patient samples. The biomarker did not
identify all patients who exhibited drug responsiveness in xenograft assays; however, reserving treatment for patients who have
the response biomarker avoids exposing those unlikely to derive
therapeutic beneﬁt to potential drug toxicities. Indeed, when
our study was initiated, FED was in clinical trials for the treatment
of MPNs. However, Sanoﬁ recently halted these trials after reports
of Wernicke's encephalopathy in a small number of treated
patients (35).
Our study provides a modern paradigm for preclinical drug
development that improves the chances of correctly identifying
drugs with LSC activity to move forward into clinical trials. The
evidence that xenotransplantation assays detect properties of AML
patient samples that correlate with outcome (5–7) increases the
conﬁdence that candidate drugs that ablate LSCs in this preclinical
model will also be effective when administered to patients.
Clinical trials evaluating novel anticancer therapies are expensive,
time consuming, and expose patients to risk. We anticipate that
adoption of this approach for preclinical evaluation and biomarker development will lead to improved patient selection and
clinical trial outcomes.
