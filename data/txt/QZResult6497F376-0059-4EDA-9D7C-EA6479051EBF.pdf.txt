ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancers
worldwide. However, current therapeutic approaches for this epidemic disease are
limited, and its 5-year survival rate hasn’t been improved in the past decades. Patientderived xenograft (PDX) tumor models have become an excellent in vivo system
for understanding of disease biology and drug discovery. In order to identify new
therapeutic targets for HCC, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on
more than 60 HCC PDX models. Among them, four models exhibited protein-altering
mutations in JAK1 (Janus Kinase 1) gene. To explore the transforming capability,
these mutations were then introduced into HEK293FT and Ba/F3 cells. The results
demonstrated that JAK1S703I mutation was able to activate JAK-STAT (Signal Transducer
and Activator of Transcription) signaling pathway and drive cell proliferation in the
absence of cytokine stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the treatment
of a JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, was observed in JAK1S703I mutant PDX model, but
not in other non-activating mutant or wild type models. Pharmacodynamic analysis
showed that phosphorylation of STAT3 in the Ruxolitinib-treated tumor tissues was
significantly suppressed. Collectively, our results suggested that JAK1S703I is an
activating mutation for JAK-STAT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, and JAK-STAT
pathway might represent a new therapeutic approach for HCC treatment. Monotherapy
using a more potent and specific JAK1 inhibitor and combinatory therapy should be
further explored in JAK1 mutant PDX models.

INTRODUCTION

Saharan Africa [1], and has been rising in North American
and Western Europe [2, 3]. Its epidemics correlates with
the prevalence of hepatitis B and C virus in Asia and U.S./
Europe, respectively [4, 5]. In fact, chronic viral infections
account for more than 70% cases of HCC globally.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common cancer type around the world. The incidence
of HCC remains particularly high in East Asia and subwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The prognosis for patient with advanced HCC
remains poor. Although sorafenib has been approved for
patients with advanced HCC in 2007 [6], the benefits
with sorafenib are modest. In the past years, there have
been renewed and continued interests in identifying novel
molecular targets in HCC.
Mechanistically, alterations of multiple signaling
pathways were detected in HCC patients, including WNT,
FGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR. Among them, deregulation
of WNT/beta-catenin signaling was found in 40-70%
HCC patients, which is responsible for cell proliferation,
migration, and self-renewal. Currently, pharmacological
inhibition of WNT pathway is being tested at early stage
of clinical trials. Further, activation of FGFR, VEGFR,
and PDGFR signaling pathways is closely related to
angiogenesis, a key process during HCC carcinogenesis.
Therefore, several multi-kinase inhibitors have been
evaluated for HCC patients, including sunitinib and
dovitinib.
Another important signaling pathway for HCC
is JAK-STAT pathway, which is critical to transferring
extracellular signal into nucleus for transcriptional
regulation. JAK-STAT pathway resides at downstream
of various transmembrane receptors, including cytokine
receptors such as interferon (IFN) and interleukin 6 (IL6), as well as aforementioned growth-factor receptors,
FGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR. Once activated, Janus
Kinase (JAK) family, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2,
could phosphorylate the cytoplasmic portion of cytokine
receptors, which in turn recruit signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) via its SH2 domain.
Dimerization of STATs then occurs when they are
associated with tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to their
translocation into nucleus and increased transcription of
downstream genes, such as c-MYC, CCND1, and VEGF.
Therefore, functional JAK-STAT pathway is required for
proliferation and survival of normal cells. [7-9]
During the carcinogenesis, several cytokine and
growth factor receptor kinases are constitutively activated
by different mechanisms. As a result, JAK-STAT pathway
is essential for the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells,
angiogenesis and metastasis. Several JAK1 mutations
were found in different cancer types, such as leukemia,
breast cancer, lung cancer, and HCC. JAK1V658F was found
in leukemia patients, leading to constitutional activation
of JAK1 [10, 11]. Further, seven distinct protein-altering
JAK1 mutations were previously identified in tumors
from HCC patients by whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Moreover, both of JAK1S729C and JAK1S703I mutations
were recurrent and proved to be activating mutations
in vitro [12]. On the other hand, a point mutation of
JAK2V617F, was found in polycythemia vera (PV), essential
thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
patients [13-15]. This mutation causes the constitutive
activation of JAK2 kinase via disrupting its autoinhibition.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the wake of strong correlation between JAK2V617F
mutation and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), the
search for JAK inhibitors has been accelerated. Multiple
molecules targeting different members of JAK kinase
family have been synthesized and characterized. Among
them, ruxolitinib was approved by FDA for patients with
MPN. According to the results of two phase III clinical
trials for myelofibrosis (COMFORT-I and COMFORTII), ruxolitinib could alleviate the splenomegaly and
other symptoms for 30-40% of patients [16, 17].
Mechanistically, ruxolitinib targets both JAK1 and JAK2
with similar IC50 by competitive inhibition of these two
kinases [18]. The IC50 of ruxolitinib for JAK1 and JAK2
in vitro were 3.3 nM and 2.8 nM, respectively [19]. In the
preclinical study, ruxolitinib could effectively inhibit the
proliferation of JAK2V617F-positive cell line and alleviate
MPN symptoms in JAK2V617F transgenic mice model [19].
However, the effect of ruxolitinib has not been extensively
studied in solid tumors.
In the present study, we aimed to identify novel
therapeutic targets in HCC and discovered four JAK1
mutations in HCC PDX models through WES. Their
identities were confirmed by targeted sequencing, and
they were then characterized for activation of JAK-STAT
pathway and oncogenic potential via Western blot analysis
and in vitro proliferation assay, respectively. Moreover,
in vivo efficacy studies of ruxolitinib were conducted
in JAK1-mutant PDX models. Taken together, our data
suggest that activating JAK1 mutations may be molecular
targets for the treatment of HCC.

RESULTS
Identification of JAK1 mutations in HCC PDX
models
More than 160 HCC PDX models were established
at WuXi AppTec in the past three years, of which over 60
models were characterized by WES. Among them, four
models (LI-03-0012, LI-03-0155, LI-03-0191, and LI-030257) were identified with non-synonymous mutations in
JAK1 gene. These JAK1 mutations, including N451S in
LI-03-0155, E483D in LI-03-0257, S703I in LI-03-0191,
and A1086S in LI-03-0012 models, were then verified
by Sanger sequencing with targeted primers (Data not
shown).
Specifically, S703I mutation was found in the
pseudo-kinase domain of JAK1 protein, and could
potentially cause the disruption of auto-inhibition of JAK1
kinase. Notably, S703I was previously identified in tumors
of two HCC patients, and proved to be an activating
mutation of JAK1 gene [12]. For the other three JAK1
mutations, A1086S is located in catalytic kinase domain,
whereas N451S and E483D are in the SH2 domain of

All four PDX models have been passaged in
BALB/c nude mice for up to 3 generations. And their
growth kinetics did not change much during this process
(Data not shown). The growth rate of LI-03-0012 is
noticeably faster than rest models. We suspected that other
oncogenic mutations may contributed to this. In addition,
H&E staining confirmed that pathological features were

maintained in each PDX model, comparing to the patient’s
tumor (PA) (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D).
Taken together, mutations of JAK1 gene were
identified in four HCC PDX models via WES, and
validated by Sanger sequencing. These JAK1-mutant PDX
models were established and ready for pharmacological
studies.

Characterization of four JAK1 mutations

addition, no other obvious driver mutations for HCC,
such as CTNNB1, have been found in genome of LI-030191 PDX model. These data suggest that, among all of
four JAK1 mutations identified in the PDX models, only
JAK1S703I mutation is able to activate JAK-STAT signaling
pathway and exhibits a transforming potential.

To explore the biological functions of JAK1
mutations in JAK-STAT signaling pathway, we introduced
these mutations into pLVX-IRES-Neo-JAK1 plasmid.
Plasmids containing EGFP, wild-type JAK1, JAK1N451S,
JAK1E483D, JAK1S703I, JAK1A1086S, and JAK1S729C were
constructed. The latter is a known and recurrent activating
mutation of JAK1 [12]. Then, plasmids containing
distinct JAK1 genes were transiently transfected into
HEK293FT cells. The expression levels of phosphorylated
JAK1, total JAK1, phosphorylated STAT3, total STAT3,
phosphorylated STAT5, and total STAT5 were analyzed
by Western blot, while β-actin served as a loading
control. Notably, similar to the positive control JAK1S729C
[12], ectopic expression of JAK1S703I in HEK293FT
cells resulted in elevated expression levels of p-JAK1,
p-STAT3, and p-STAT5 (Figure 2A).
To further evaluate the transformation ability
of these JAK1 mutations, Ba/F3 cells were stably
infected with lentivirus expressing EGFP, wild-type
JAK1, JAK1N451S, JAK1E483D, JAK1S703I, JAK1A1086S, and
JAK1S729C, respectively. In the absence of IL-3, only the
cells expressing JAK1S703I or positive control JAK1S729C
were capable of continual proliferation, whereas the cells
expressing the EGFP, wild-type and the other mutations
of JAK1 gene ceased to grow in vitro (Figure 2B). In

Anti-tumor activity of ruxolitinib in JAK1S703Imutant PDX model
In vivo efficacy studies of JAK1/2 inhibitor,
ruxolitinib, were conducted in these four JAK1-mutant
models and a JAK1-WT PDX model as a control (Figure
3A). The results showed that, only in LI-03-0191 model
bearing JAK1S703I mutation, treatment with ruxolitinib
resulted in a tumor growth inhibition (TGI, 48%) in
comparison with the vehicle control group. No significant
anti-tumor activity of ruxolitinib was observed in rest three
JAK1-mutant models, as well as JAK1-WT model. These
results indicate that tumor growth in LI-03-0191 PDX
model is sensitive to inhibition of JAK kinase, suggesting
that JAK1S703I may play a critical role for tumorigenesis in
this HCC model.

Pharmacodynamics analysis of
signaling pathway in tumor tissues

JAK-STAT

since most studies were conducted in vitro or in cell line
derived xenograft models, it is hard to directly translate
these findings to clinical development of HCC therapies.
In addition, though ruxolitinib was approved by FDA for
myelofibrosis in 2007, it is not clear whether ruxolitinib
is able to suppress in vivo growth of tumors with aberrant
JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
Intriguingly, as shown in our study, inhibition
of activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway caused by
JAK1S703I mutation produced an obvious delay of tumor
progression in HCC PDX models. PDX models prove to
be biologically stable, which is superior to cancer-cellderived xenograft model [28]. HCC PDX models can
also maintain the tumor microenvironment and vascular
structure of patient tumors. Given that JAK-STAT
signaling pathway has been demonstrated to play an
important role in tumor microenvironment [29], our results
in PDX models will shed light on the clinical development
of HCC therapies. Further, these results demonstrated that
ruxolitinib is capable of shrinking solid tumors, such as
HCC, with activating JAK1 mutation.
In addition, since JAK-STAT pathway is important
for various physiological functions, only HCC patients
with upregulated JAK-STAT signaling could be treated
with JAK inhibitors, thus a therapeutic window may exist.
And accurate detection of mutations in related cancer
genes is also critical before treatment strategy can be
finalized for each individual patient.
Admittedly, further investigations are warranted
to answer whether other activating mechanisms exist for
JAK-STAT pathway in HCC. Nevertheless, the present
study suggests that, in addition to standard-of-care
therapy, a portion of HCC patients could benefit from
targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Combinational or
sequential therapies based on sorafenib and JAK inhibitors
would likely provide larger therapeutic margin to HCC
patients with activated JAK-STAT pathway.

To further investigate the molecular mechanisms
behind ruxolitinib-induced growth inhibition, tumor
tissues were harvested from LI-03-0191 model in the
above efficacy study. Constitutively activated STAT3 per
se has been shown to be able to function as an oncogene,
and STAT3 has been widely accepted as a cancer
therapeutic target [20-22]. Thus, the expression levels of
phosphorylated and total STAT3 in these samples were
analyzed by Western blot, in comparison with the tumor
samples obtained from two HCC patients.
Firstly, the level of total STAT3 in two HCC patient
samples appeared to be higher than that in corresponding
adjacent normal tissues. Interestingly, treatment of
ruxolitinib led to a significant reduction (50%) of the
phosphorylation level of STAT3 in tumors collected from
all five animals in LI-03-0191 model, compared with
that in vehicle group. In addition, a modest reduction of
total STAT3 level was also observed in ruxolitinib-treated
group in comparison with vehicle group (Figure 3B and
3C). These results suggest that ruxolitinib may cause the
suppression of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in PDX
models bearing JAK1S703I mutation.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have characterized four JAK1
mutations in over 60 HCC PDX models established at
WuXi AppTec. These mutations were identified by WES
analysis, confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and then
evaluated for their transforming potential in vitro. Among
them, JAK1S703I was able to activate JAK-STAT signaling
pathway and drove in vitro cell proliferation independent
of IL-3 stimulation in otherwise IL-3 dependent Ba/F3
cell line. Further, the tumor growth of HCC PDX model
bearing JAK1S703I mutation was sensitive to treatment of
a JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. These data indicated that
JAK1S703I may be an activating mutation in HCC.
Currently, multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is used as
first line therapy for unresectable advanced HCC patients,
which only yields limited elongation in patients’ survival
time [23]. Therefore, the search for new therapeutic targets
in HCC is urgently needed.
Previous studies have demonstrated that
pharmacological inhibition of STAT protein and
upregulation of Src-homology protein tyrosine
phosphatases (SHPs), a negative regulator of JAKSTAT pathway, could prevent growth of HCC cell line
in vitro and in vivo [24-26]. In addition, an earlier study
reported that targeting JAK-STAT pathway in HCC cell
lines by ruxolitinib led to apoptosis in vitro [27]. These
evidences strongly suggested that abnormal activation of
JAK-STAT pathway is associated with HCC. However,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Establishment of HCC PDX Models
In compliance with the protocol approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital/Institute of Shanghai and with the
subject’s informed consent, primary tumor tissues were
collected for PDX establishment as described earlier
[30]. In brief, surgically resected primary tumor tissues
(designated as PA) were implanted subcutaneously in
female BALB/c nude mice (Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Once the first
generation of xenograft (designed as P0) was established,
serial implantations in BALB/c nude mice were performed
to expand the xenograft tumors (i.e., P1, P2, P3, and

curves. All procedures and protocols were approved by

Histology
Pieces of patient samples (PA) or PDX tissues at
each passage were collected and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin [30]. Histopathology was reviewed by a boardcertified pathologist (X.X.).

Cell culture
All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293FT cells were maintained
in DMEM medium (high glucose) supplemented with
10% FBS, 0.1mM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen),
6 mM L-Glutamine and 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate. Ba/F3
cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing
10% FBS and 2.5 ng/ml IL-3 (Invitrogen)

Tissue processing for genomic studies
Genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp
DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The
concentrations were quantified using NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE).
DNA samples with A260/280 ratios between 1.8 and 2.0 and
A260/230 ratios above 2.0, and proven to be high quality by
gel electrophoresis were used for WES and SNP 6.0 array
analyses.

and

Human JAK1 open reading frames (ORFs) for wildtype and mutant variants (A1086S, N451S, E483D, S703I
and S729C) as well as an EGFP ORF were synthesized
and constructed into the lentiviral vector pLVX-IRESNeo (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Lentivirus was
packaged using HEK293T cells and concentrated using
polyethylene glycol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Ba/F3 cells
cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS and
2.5 ng/ml IL-3 were infected with viruses carrying JAK1
ORFs (wild-type or mutant) or EGFP as a control followed
by G418 (Invitrogen) selection and subsequent expansion.
For assaying transforming potential of JAK1 mutants,
transduced Ba/F3 cells were cultured in the absence of
IL-3 in triplicates. Cell counting was performed every 3
days for a total of 9 days.

Whole exome sequencing (WES)
One microgram of each DNA sample isolated from
P3 xenograft tumors was used for library construction
using a TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). Libraries were pooled (500 ng each)
for exome capture and amplification using the TruSeq
Exome Enrichment kit (Illumina). Sequencing was then
performed with paired-end 2x100 base reads on the HiSeq
2000 platform (Illumina). Raw FASTQ files were first
processed by a proprietary algorithm to filter out mouse
sequence contaminations. We have shown that this filter
step does not affect the human SNP detection [31, 32].
After mouse sequence removed, sequencing reads were
aligned to human reference genome hg19/GRCh37 by
BWA 0.6.1 and processed to variants calling by GATK 1.6.

HEK293FT cells were seeded the day before at
8x105 cells/well in a 6-well plate, and transfected with
2.5 ug the fore-mentioned lentiviral plasmid DNA (JAK1
wild-type, JAK1 mutants or EGFP) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, cells were serum
starved for 4 hr and then lysed in RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Swiss) and phosphatase
inhibitors (Sigma). Protein lysates were then diluted by 4X
LDS Sample Buffer and 10X Reducing Agent, denatured
by boiling, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting
was performed as described earlier [33]. Following
antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA) were used: phosphorylated JAK1 (p-JAK1;

Total RNA (1 μg) was reversely transcribed into
single-stranded cDNAs using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kits (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,

microliter of cDNA was used for a subsequent 25-μl
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a
Premix Prime STAR HS PCR amplification kit (Takara
Bio, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). To detect JAK1 mutations, we

implanted subcutaneously with a tumor fragment by using
a trocar. When the average tumor size reached 150 to 200
mm3, tumor size-matched mice were randomly assigned
to two groups with five mice in each group. The tumorbearing mice were given ruxolitinib at 90 mg/kg twice per
day orally [34], or vehicle alone for indicated time. Tumor
volumes and body weights were measured using calipers
twice a week.
