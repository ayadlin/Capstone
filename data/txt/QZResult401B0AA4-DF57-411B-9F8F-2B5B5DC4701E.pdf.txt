ABSTRACT
Alterations of TWIST-1 expression are often seen in solid tumors and contribute
to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, studies concerning its pathogenic
role in leukemia are scarce. Our study shows that TWIST-1 is overexpressed in bone
marrow mononuclear cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrate
that TWIST-1 promotes cell growth, colony formation and drug resistance of AML and
CML cell lines. Furthermore, TWIST-1 is aberrantly highly expressed in CD34+CD38−
leukemia stem cell candidates and its expression declines with differentiation. Downmodulation of TWIST-1 in myeloid leukemia CD34+ cells impairs their colony-forming
capacity. Mechanistically, c-MPL, which is highly expressed in myeloid leukemia
cells and associated with poor prognosis, is identified as a TWIST-1 coexpressed
gene in myeloid leukemia patients and partially contributes to TWIST-1-mediated
leukemogenic effects. Moreover, patients with higher TWIST-1 expression have
shorter overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) in AML. Multivariate analysis
further demonstrates that TWIST-1 overexpression is a novel independent
unfavourable predictor for both OS and EFS in AML. These data highlight TWIST-1
as a new candidate gene contributing to leukemogenesis of myeloid leukemia, and
propose possible new avenues for improving risk and treatment stratification in AML.

remain of utmost value to improve outcome prediction or
provide potential targets for therapy.
TWIST-1, a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor, plays a key role in the specification and
differentiation of the tissues with a mesodermal origin in both
Drosophila and vertebrates [7–9]. In human, overexpression
of TWIST-1 has been observed in various solid tumors and
is often associated with aggressive phenotypes and poor
prognosis [10–14]. It’s now well accepted that TWIST-1,
which may function as a multifunctional proto-oncogene
during tumorigenesis and progression of solid tumors,
protects cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and
senescence and promotes tumor epithelial-mesenchymal
transition [13, 15–19].
In many cancers, evidence suggests that a small subset
of malignant cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), is

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
clonal malignancy with considerable diversity concerning
clinical behavior and prognosis [1–3]. Chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disease
characterized by constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase [4]. Despite this consistent molecular
abnormality, CML still exhibits marked heterogeneity
in prognosis because of development of secondary
cytogenetic changes or resistance [5, 6]. In recent years,
although many of genetic and molecular alterations, such
as deregulation of gene expression or acquired genetic
mutation, have proven to be useful molecular tools for
diagnosis and risk stratification of myeloid leukemia, the
discovery and validation of new discriminative biomarkers

wholly responsible for tumor propagation, metastasis, disease
relapse and drug resistance. Targeting of CSCs carries the
hope of curing cancer [20]. Recently, TWIST-1 has attracted
intense interest due to its contribution in generation and
maintenance of CSCs. Overexpression of TWIST-1 in breast
cell lines, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells,
and cervical cancer cells enhanced tumor-initiating and selfrenewal capability [21–23]. In the blood system, our previous
study demonstrates that TWIST-1 is highly expressed in
mouse long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and is
a novel regulator of HSC self-renewal and myeloid lineage
development [24]. Thus far, there are only a few studies
concerning the role of TWIST-1 in human hematopoietic
malignancies. Cosset et al reveals that overexpression of
TWIST-1 represents a prognostic factor in CML and may
contribute to drug resistance [25]. TWIST-1 has also been
reported as an antiapoptotic factor in myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS) [26]. However, the role of TWIST-1 in
AML and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), whether it is
associated with leukemia stem cells (LSCs), and its potential
pathogenic mechanism in CML remain unknown.
We first determined TWIST-1 expression level by
quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC)
in different hematopoietic malignancies including AML, ALL
and CML. Our study demonstrated that TWIST-1 was highly
expressed in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs)
of patients with AML and CML, whereas normalization of
TWIST-1 expression was observed in patients with ALL.
We also found that TWIST-1 enhanced cell growth, colony
formation, drug resistance and tumor formation in AML and
CML cell lines. In addition, we analyzed TWIST-1 expression
patterns in different hematopoietic cell populations from
AML and CML patients, and found that TWIST-1 was
most highly expressed in CD34+CD38− cells but showed
a low abundance in more differentiated descendants.
TWIST-1 knockdown impaired stem/progenitor cell colonyforming capacity of primary myeloid leukemia CD34+
cells. Furthermore, TWIST-1 could mediate the expression
of c-MPL by interfering with RUNX1. Overexpression of
c-MPL could significantly attenuate the inhibitory effects of
knockdown TWIST-1 on the growth of AML and CML cell
lines. TWIST-1 overexpression resulted in the activation of
phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT and JAK2/ERK pathways
which are downstream pathways of c-MPL. These results
suggested a functional interaction between TWIST-1 and
c-MPL in AML and CML cell lines. Most importantly, we
identified TWIST-1 as a novel independent prognostic factor
for poor outcome in AML.

of TWIST-1 in the myeloid cell lines NB4, KG1a, J6–1,
U937, HL-60, and K562, originally derived from patients
with myeloid leukemia, as well as CEM, Ramos, Jurkat,
and Namalwa derived from leukemia of lymphoid origin,
or lymphoma patients. The human glioma cell line U251
was used as a positive control for TWIST-1 detection [27].
We observed significantly higher TWIST-1 in myeloid
compared with lymphoid cell lines (Figure 1A–1B). Next,
we analyzed primary leukemia samples and collected
BMMNCs derived from patients with AML (n = 103),
CML (n = 59) and ALL (n = 37). In spite of the wide
range of individual values of TWIST-1, median levels of
TWIST-1 were significantly higher in patients with AML
and CML than in controls (n = 29), whereas no significant
difference was observed in TWIST-1 expression between
ALL patients and controls (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
TWIST-1 protein expression measured by scoring IHC
of BM samples correlated well with TWIST-1 mRNA
expression in the 31 patients studied (Supplementary
Figure S1), suggesting that TWIST-1 mRNA expression
was informative in the prediction of protein expression.
Representative of IHC of AML and CML BMMNCs
with higher scores and ALL and healthy volunteer
BMMNCs with lower scores were shown in Figure 1D.
In order to further substantiate our findings that TWIST-1
was overexpressed in myeloid leukemia, we analyzed
TWIST-1 expression using several published datasets
from the Oncomine databases. We found that TWIST-1
transcript levels are significantly upregulated in AML
samples based on microarray gene expression data of
human AML (n = 542) and healthy individuals (n = 74)
(Figure 1E) [28, 29].
We then analyzed the correlation of TWIST-1
expression with other clinical characteristics of leukemia.
All patient data were shown in Supplementary Table S2.
We found that the expression level of TWIST-1 was not
related to sex, age, white blood cell counts, BM blasts,
extramedullary infiltration or CD34 expression in AML
and CML samples (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Of
note, patients with high TWIST-1 expression had a higher
percentage of FAB M3 subtype in AML (Supplementary
Table S3).
Overall, the results reveal that aberrant high
expression level of TWIST-1 is found in patients with
AML and CML, suggesting a possible role of TWIST-1 in
myeloid leukemogenesis.

cell growth and drug resistance

RESULTS

The above results prompted us to investigate the role
of TWIST-1 in tumorigenesis. We used a pCDH1-based
lentiviral system to mediate transduction of TWIST-1
cDNA-containing expression vector or empty vector into
U937 and K562 cells. Cell lines that stably expressed
TWIST-1 were generated and analyzed by real-time PCR

and Western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S2A–
S2B). Overexpression of TWIST-1 significantly promoted
cell growth and colony formation in both U937 and K562
cells, while no difference in cell growth was detected in
Jurkat cells (Figure 2A–2B). In recent years, emerging
evidences suggest that TWIST-1 enhances the acquired
resistance of cancer cells to drug [16, 18, 30, 31]. To further
evaluate the biological significance of TWIST-1 on the cell
sensitivity to drug in myeloid leukemia cells, a cell viability
assay was then performed. Compared with U937 cells and
vector alone-transduced U937 cells, TWIST-1-transduced
U937 cells showed a significant decrease in cell sensitivity
to Daunorubicin (DNR) and Mitoxantrone (MXT) over
24, 48 and 72 hours. TWIST-1-transducd U937 cells were
4- to 17-fold more resistant to DNR and 2- to 3-fold more
resistant to MXT than cells expressing control vector
(Figure 2C–2D and Supplementary Figure S2C). Similar
phenomenon was observed in K562 cells. When treated
with Imatinib and DNR, TWIST-1-transducd K562 cells
significantly increased resistance at different time points
(Figure 2C–2D and Supplementary Figure S2C).
Meanwhile, we examined the protection activity
of TWIST-1 on apoptosis. Transfected U937 and K562
cells were treated with DNR and Imatinib, respectively,
for 24 hours to induce apoptosis. We found that TWIST-1
significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of U937 and
K562 cells (Figure 2E). Although overexpression of
TWIST-1 did not directly affect apoptosis of U937 and
K562 (data not shown), it provided protection activity
against apoptosis induced by DNR and Imatinib. In
addition, TWIST-1 induced the accumulation of U937
cells in the S phase of the cell cycles, but not in K562
cells (Supplementary Figure S2D). These results strongly
suggest that TWIST-1 promotes cell growth, colony
formation and drug resistance in myeloid leukemia.

TWIST-1 impacts the cell cycle distribution in a cell type
dependent manner.
To confirm the in vivo tumorigenicity-ability of
TWIST-1, K562 cells transfected with shTWIST-1 or
shCtrl were injected by tail vein in NOD/SCID mice. The
expression of human CD13 and CD33-positive tumor
cells, which are considered to be the tumor marker of
K562 cells, was high in BM and spleen in dying mice,
which suggested that the mouse model bearing leukemia
could be established (Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B).
We found that the survival time of shTWIST-1 group was
significantly longer than that of shCtrl group (Figure 3E).
The results indicate that down-regulation of TWIST-1
reduces tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and this effect is
due at least in part to increased cell apoptosis.

TWIST-1 is predominantly expressed in myeloid
leukemia stem cell candidates and TWIST-1
inhibition reduces leukemia stem/progenitor
cell frequencies
Our previous study has shown that TWIST-1 is
selectively expressed in mouse LT-HSCs [24]. Cosset [25]
and Li [26] have reported that TWIST-1 is highly expressed
in the CD34+ compartments in patients with CML and
MDS. We were, therefore interested in determining the
expression of TWIST-1 in immature myeloid leukemia
cells. Aberrantly high expression of TWIST-1 in leukemia
stem/progenitor cells could be confirmed when we analyzed
the expression of TWIST-1 in highly purified leukemic
CD34+CD38−, CD34+CD38+ and CD34− cells isolated
from patients with AML (n = 9) and CML (n = 9). TWIST-1
was expressed at the highest level in CD34+CD38− cells,
and its expression levels in both CD34+CD38− and
CD34+CD38+ subpopulations were higher than that in
CD34− cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, TWIST-1 expression
in CD34+CD38− immature cells from myeloid leukemia
patients (n = 6) was significantly higher compared with
cord blood (CB) (n = 5) (Figure 4B). The findings that
TWIST-1 was predominantly expressed in the leukemia
stem cell candidates of AML and CML suggest a possible
role of TWIST-1 in primitive myeloid leukemia cells.
Therefore, we next investigated the effects of downmodulation of TWIST-1 on the colony forming ability in
myeloid leukemia stem/progenitor cells. CD34+ cells were
isolated from AML (n = 6) and CML (n = 5) patients,
followed by transduction with shCtrl or shTWIST-1
vectors and sorting for green fluorescent protein (GFP)
expression. Transduction efficiencies ranged from 10% to
50% for both groups (data not shown). All AML and CML
samples studied in CFC were known to harbor the FLT3/
ITD and BCR/ABL, respectively. The results showed that
not only was the number of colony-forming cells (CFCs)
strongly reduced, the size of colonies also was reduced upon
TWIST-1 down-modulation (Figure 4C–4D). No significant
effects were observed on hematopoietic differentiation upon

Knockdown of TWIST-1 inhibits tumor growth
In order to further identify the potential function
of TWIST-1, we silenced TWIST-1 in K562 and KG1a
cell lines. Robust TWIST-1 knockdown was achieved
following lentiviral transduction with pLL3.7-based vector
expressing either shTWIST-1 or scrambled sequence only
as a control. Knockdown of TWIST-1 was confirmed by
real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis in transduced
K562 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A–S3B). Silencing
of TWIST-1 decreased cell growth over time in both
KG1a and K562 cell lines (Figure 3A). The reduction
of TWIST-1 expression also resulted in a significant
decrease in the number and size of colonies in K562 cells
(Figure 3B). In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed
increased apoptosis in shTWIST-1 -transduced K562 cells
(Figure 3C), suggesting the important role of TWIST-1 in
the survival of leukemia cells. Although no differences
in cell cycle were detected in K562 cells (Figure 3D),
TWIST-1 ablation induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in
U937 cells (Supplementary Figure S3C), suggesting that

demonstrated that most of the colonies from the CFC were

we investigated the correlation between TWIST-1 and

correlation in myeloid leukemia samples (Figure 5E).

c-MPL, representing possible binding sites of TWIST-1. To
test whether c-MPL can be directly targeted by TWIST-1,
we constructed the luciferase reporters that contained
the putative TWIST-1 binding sites (Supplementary
Figure S5A). Our results showed that compared to
negative control, overexpression of TWIST-1 had no
effect on the firefly luciferase activity of c-MPL construct
(Supplementary Figure S5B), which suggests that c-MPL
is not a direct target of TWIST-1. It has been reported
that TWIST-1 could directly bind to the RUNX1 Runt
domain and decrease RUNX1 transactivation activity [36].
In HSPCs, RUNX1 works as a negative regulator of the
c-MPL [37]. We have previously characterized that RUNX1
transcript level is repressed and c-MPL expression is upregulated in TWIST-1-overexpressing Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1+
(LKS) cells in the mouse hematopoietic system [24]. Thus,
we analyzed whether TWIST-1 mediated the expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of c-MPL by RUNX1 in AML and CML cell lines. As
expected, a significant repression of RUNX1 transcript level
in U937 and K562 overexpressing TWIST-1 was observed
compared with the control cells (Figure 5F). Moreover,
the expression of RUNX1 in TWIST-1 shRNA-transduced
K562 and U937 cells were obviously up-regulated
(Figure 5F). Collectively, these studies indicate that the
important role for TWIST-1 in AML and CML pathology
may involve the RUNX1/c-MPL regulatory pathway.

were generated and analyzed by FACS (Supplementary
Figure S6). Consistent with the results from TWIST-1
overexpression studies, the cell growth and CFC
production of U937 and K562 cells were promoted when
c-MPL was overexpressed (Figure 6A–6B). Moreover,
c-MPL-transduced U937 and K562 cells also showed a
significant decrease in cell sensitivity to DNR and Imatinib
(Figure 6C). Next, we investigated whether exogenous
expression of c-MPL using a c-MPL expression plasmid
rescued the impaired cell growth and colony formation
caused by TWIST-1 knockdown. Our results showed
that enforced expression of c-MPL partially recovered

the cell growth and colony formation ability in TWIST-1
knockdown cells (Figure 6D–6E).
We also determined whether the downstream
signaling pathways of c-MPL underlie the TWIST-1mediated effects in myeloid leukemia. We demonstrated
that TWIST-1 overexpression in U937 and K562 cell
lines led to 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold higher contents of
ERK phosphorylation, and 2-fold and 1.8-fold higher
contents of PI3K phosphorylation, respectively. However,
TWIST-1 overexpression did not induce STAT3 and
STAT5 activation. These observations are consistent with
the effects of c-MPL overexpression (Figure 6F). These

and parameters of long-term outcome. Because the level
of expression of TWIST-1 appears to be a continuum,
we defined a threshold for high versus normal TWIST-1
expression based on the expression of TWIST-1 in normal
BM (threshold: median expression in normal BM). When
all the AML cases were analyzed together (regardless of the
cytogenetic and phenotypic subgroup), we found that high
TWIST-1 expression was associated with worse overall
survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free
survival (DFS). The 6-year OS was 66.7% ± 11.1% for
patients with high TWIST-1 expression compared with
31.8% ± 8.1% for patients with normal TWIST-1 levels

Higher TWIST-1 expression is an independent
poor prognostic factor in AML
Next, we analyzed whether TWIST-1 expression level
correlates with clinical outcome in myeloid leukemia. Due
to the limitations of available material and feedback of CML
patients, here we intensively focused on clinical implication

evidence that TWIST-1 was highly expressed in patients
with AML, whereas no significant difference was observed
between ALL patients and controls. The finding that
TWIST-1 is overexpressed in AML is further supported
by the data from Oncomine expression database. We also
demonstrated higher expression of TWIST-1 in patients with
CML, which is consistent with the observation of Cosset et
al [25]. In addition, gain-of-function and loss-of-function
analyses revealed that high TWIST-1 expression promoted
cell growth, colony formation and drug resistance in both

AML and CML cell lines. Therefore, although myeloid
leukemias are heterogeneous in terms of phenotype, disease
progression, prognosis, and response to therapy, TWIST-1
appears to be a common pathogenic factor for both AML
and CML, suggesting its importance in the development of
myeloid leukemias.
LSCs are first identified in AML by John Dick and
colleagues [38, 39] and are considered responsible for
leukemia initiation, relapse and resistance to chemotherapy.
Both AML and CML have been reported to be LSC diseases
[3, 5]. Although some studies have reported that LSCs
in some types of AML may be present within myeloid
progenitor population [40, 41], the CD34+CD38− population
concentrates the LSCs in a vast majority of cases [42], and
is thought to contain very primitive HSCs with long-term
reconstitution activity and multipotent progenitor cells [43].
Here we observed that TWIST-1 was mainly expressed in
immature CD34+CD38− cells from patients with AML and
CML but that expression declines with differentiation.
TWIST-1 knockdown in AML and CML CD34+ cells
inhibited their proliferative capacity, indicating that
TWIST-1 might be a key factor in the maintenance of LSCs
function. These findings also provide a possible mechanism
by which TWIST-1 is involved in the development of
both AML and CML. Our previous study has revealed
that TWIST-1 is predominantly expressed in LT-HSC
in normal adult mouse BM, and it is involved in the
maintenance of HSC dormancy and self-renewal capacity.
Here we found that TWIST-1 also had higher expression
in immature human CB CD34+ cells than in CD34− cells
(Supplementary Figure S7A). Down-regulation of TWIST-1
resulted in a significant inhibition in the colony forming
ability in CB CD34+ cells (Supplementary Figure S7B).
These observations suggest that TWIST-1 may be involved
in regulation of both LSCs and HSCs. Several factors
spanning Notch, HOX genes and the polycomb proteins
are not only associated with self-renewal of HSC, but also
play a role in the perpetual self-renewal of LSC [44–49].
TWIST-1 tends to be a new member of these regulatory
factors. Of note, we demonstrated that TWIST-1 expression
level was significantly higher in CD34+CD38− immature
cells from AML and CML patients compared with those
from CB, suggesting that although TWIST-1 plays roles in
both leukemia and normal stem cells, it may be functionally
more critical for leukemia than for normal stem cells [50].
We performed transcriptome analysis to obtain
clues of how TWIST-1 affected myeloid leukemia.
Through the array data, we focused on a tiny set of
overrepresented genes. Real-time PCR analysis validated
5 candidates, namely c-MPL, TRIB3, NUMB, SMAD3
and JMJD1C, and c-MPL was found to be the most
significantly upregulated in TWIST-transfected U937
cells. Myeloproliferative leukemia virus proto-oncogene
c-MPL is a gene encoding the receptor for the cytokine
thrombopoietin (TPO). It has been reported that c-MPL
is highly expressed in LSCs of AML and high level of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TPO/c-MPL signaling in AML enhances cell resistance
to chemotherapy, survival and self-renewing capacity
[32, 34, 35, 51–53]. In addition, c-MPL overexpression
is an adverse prognostic factor associated with shorter
complete remission duration and unfavorable cytogenetics
in AML [33, 54, 55]. Here we demonstrated the positive
correlations exist between TWIST-1 and c-MPL
expression in AML and CML cells. Functional studies
indicate that c-MPL is an important intermediary in
TWIST-1-mediated leukemogenic effects. Intriguingly,
although K562 and U937 were not grown in the presence
of TPO, the increased phosphorylation PI3K/AKT
and JAK2/ERK pathways upon TWIST-1 and c-MPL
overexpression were observed, suggesting the activation
of c-MPL. One possible explanation is that TPO is
produced by leukemia cells before or after TWIST-1 and
c-MPL transduction. We then measured TPO levels by
sandwich ELISA in the culture supernatant of wild type,
vector-, TWIST-1- and c-MPL-transfected K562 and U937
cell lines, and found that TPO levels were undetectable in
these groups (data not shown). It has been reported that
there are some factors could overlap the biological effects
with TPO by interacting with c-MPL [56]. Additional
studies are required to uncover the mechanism by which
TWIST-1 activates c-MPL without TPO.
Efforts are being made in recent years to identify
new prognostic markers in order to help in deciding the
route of treatment for the patients. In the previous reports,
expression of TWIST-1 is a statistically significant
prognostic factor in several types of solid tumors,
where high expression of TWIST-1 resulted in a worse
patient outcome [10, 12, 14, 57, 58]. In our study, we
evaluated the prognostic significance of TWIST-1 mRNA
expression levels in 52 adult patients with AML. Our data
revealed that TWIST-1 overexpression was associated
with treatment failure, specifically shorter OS and
EFS. To estimate the contribution of prognostic factors
significance in univariate analysis, multivariate analysis
was performed. It showed that TWIST-1 expression levels
and age were both independent prognostic parameters
for OS and DFS in patients with AML. For the first time,
TWIST-1 was verified as an independent prognostic
marker in AML. However, the limitation in this study
is that we have not included cytogenetic and molecular
abnormalities prognostic marker in our analysis because
of the limited patient material. Hence, the clinical
significance of TWIST-1 expression needs to be further
evaluated in large clinical trials in the context of other
prognostic markers.
In conclusion, our data substantiate the important
pathogenic roles for TWIST-1 in myeloid leukemia and
provide a new molecular marker for refining the risk
classification of AML. In the future, TWIST-1-targeted
therapy may represent a potential new approach for
patients with AML and CML who have higher expression
of this protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

were composed of the same bases as the TWIST-1 shRNA
and served as controls. The sequences of the shRNA
oligos were listed in Supplementary Table S1. The
constructs pLL3.7-shTWIST-1a, pLL3.7-shTWIST-1b,
pLL3.7-shcontrola and pLL3.7-shcontrolb were derived
by single-strand annealing of the oligonucleotides of the
target sequences and subsequent cloning of the doublestranded oligonucleotides into the pLL3.7 vector. pLL3.7shcontrol and pLL3.7-shTWIST-1 were named as shCtrl
and shTWIST-1 in our study, respectively. To create the
pMSCV-IRES-BFP vector, the green fluorescent protein
(GFP) in the pMSCV-IRES-GFP backbone was replaced
with blue fluorescent protein (BFP). The cDNAs for c-MPL
was cloned into pCDH1-MCS1-EF1-copGFP (System
Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and pMSCV-IRES-BFP
transfer vectors, respectively. The resulting constructs were
verified by sequencing. Vectors were transfected into 293T
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Supernatant
containing retroviruses was collected and concentrated
48 and 72 hours later and was used for the transduction.
The transduction of cells was done by spinning with viral
supernatant. Seventy-two hours after transduction, cell
sorting for GFP fluorescence was done by the FACS Aria
II instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

BM specimens were collected from patients with a
new diagnosis of AML (n = 103), CML (n = 59), or ALL
(n = 37) at Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases
Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from
January 2005 to December 2008, which were under the
ethical principles for medical research and approved by
the Ethics Committee of Institute of Hematology and
Blood Diseases Hospital. Informed consent was obtained
in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki. BM cells
from healthy volunteers and patients with ITP, a benign
hematological disease, were used as controls (n = 29).
CB was obtained after informed consent from healthy
postpartum women. MNCs were isolated by FicollHypaque density gradient centrifugation. CD34 and
CD38 cells were selected by immunomagnetic column
separation (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in IMDM
Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 ng/mL SCF, 50

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR

Colony-forming cell assay

Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol extraction
reagent (Invitrogen) or an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV
Reverse Transcript reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR kit
(TaKaRa Bio Inc, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) and analyzed in an
ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System. The expression
level of each gene was normalized to the expression level
of GAPDH. PCR primers were listed in Supplementary
Table S1.

For the CFC assay, purified CD34+ cells were
transduced with shCtrl or shTWIST-1 virus, and then
sorted. A thousand GFP+ sorted cells were suspended
in methylcellulose media (MethoCult H4434; Stemcell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and then incubated
at 37°C for 14 days. A colony was defined as a cluster
of more than 50 cells. For the CML samples, colonies
were pooled, and the percentage of BCR/ABL-positive
cells was determined by PCR. A genomic PCR for the
detection of FLT3/ITD was performed on colonies plucked
from direct CFC assays. PCR primers were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

an international expert panel, on behalf of the European
LeukemiaNet. Blood. 2010; 115:453–474.

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
software, release 17.0. The association between variables
was analyzed by the χ2-square and the Fisher’s exact
test for categorical variables and the Student’s t test
or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.
Correlations between continuous variables were calculated
using the Spearman correlation or Logistic correlation
analyses. To assess outcome, the following parameters
were used: OS (defined as the time from diagnosis to
death of any cause or end of follow-up); EFS (defined as
the time from diagnosis until first event, in which failure
to achieve complete remission, relapse, death, or end of
follow-up were considered events); DFS (defined as the
time between achieving complete remission and relapse).
OS, EFS, and DFS were estimated according to KaplanMeier and compared according to log-rank test. The
association between TWIST-1 and OS, EFS and DFS was
tested in univariate Cox models. Cox regression analysis
was applied to determine the association of TWIST-1
expression and OS/EFS/DFS with adjustment for risk
factors such as age, white blood cell count, sex. The
parameters were considered either as continuous or as
categorical variables and only those reaching a P value
< 0.1 in the respective univariate analysis were included.
All P values were considered significant when < 0.05.
