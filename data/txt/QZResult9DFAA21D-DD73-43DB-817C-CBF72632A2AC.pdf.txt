Abstract
Aberrant Shh signaling promotes tumor growth in diverse
cancers. The importance of Shh signaling is particularly evident
in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), where
inhibitors targeting the Shh pathway component Smoothened
(Smo) show great therapeutic promise. However, the emergence
of drug resistance limits long-term efﬁcacy, and the mechanisms
of resistance remain poorly understood. Using new medulloblastoma models, we identify two distinct paradigms of resistance to
Smo inhibition. Sufu mutations lead to maintenance of the Shh

pathway in the presence of Smo inhibitors. Alternatively activation of the RAS–MAPK pathway circumvents Shh pathway dependency, drives tumor growth, and enhances metastatic behavior.
Strikingly, in BCC patients treated with Smo inhibitor, squamous
cell cancers with RAS/MAPK activation emerged from the
antecedent BCC tumors. Together, these ﬁndings reveal a critical role of the RAS–MAPK pathway in drug resistance and
tumor evolution of Shh pathway–dependent tumors. Cancer Res;

Introduction

pressor Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), and activates Gli transcription
factors. Gli target genes include Gli1, Ptch, Nmyc, and Cyclin D1
(Ccnd1). Small-molecule antagonists of Smo, including Vismodegib (GDC-0449; Roche), Sonidegib (LDE225; Novartis), and
XL-139 (BMS/Exelixis), provide promising targeted therapy for
BCC and medulloblastoma (1, 4–7), and are in clinical trials or in
use for these indications.
Despite initial success of Smo inhibitors, long-term efﬁcacy is
limited by pre-existing or acquired drug resistance (8, 9). Studies
of other cancers indicate that both cell-autonomous mutations
and microenvironment-derived factors contribute to therapeutic
resistance (10). Ampliﬁcation of Gli2 and point mutations in Smo
that prevent drug binding have been reported to cause resistance
in preclinical and clinical studies (4, 5, 11). Increased activation of
PI3K, aPKC-i/l, or cell-cycle components may also contribute to
resistance (5, 12, 13). Additional mechanisms of resistance are
likely to arise in clinical practice, and must be understood to
develop more effective therapeutic strategies for Shh-dependent
tumors.
To date, the absence of reliable in vitro systems for growing and
maintaining Shh-dependent tumors has been a major impediment for studying these cancers (14). Here, we report an approach
for generating stable medulloblastoma cell lines that are tumorigenic and retain key characteristics of Shh-subtype medulloblastoma. Using these models, we identify two paradigms of resistance to Smo inhibitors. Loss of Sufu reactivates the Shh pathway
downstream of Smo and thereby causes acquired therapeutic
resistance. In a second scenario, activation of the RAS–MAPK
pathway overrides oncogenic addiction to Shh signaling and
enables proliferation of resistant tumors with enhanced metastatic behavior. In human cancers, MAPK pathway activation is
increased in metastatic medulloblastoma tumor cells. Strikingly,

Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays a critical role in growth
and patterning during development, and aberrant activation of
Shh signaling is implicated in several cancers (1). Germline
mutations that activate Shh signaling predispose to basal cell
carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma in humans and mice,
whereas somatic mutations in Shh components are frequently
observed in such tumors (2, 3).
Signaling is initiated when Shh, a secreted protein, binds its
receptor, Patched (Ptch). In the absence of Shh, Ptch suppresses
activity of Smoothened (Smo). When Shh binds Ptch, Smo
initiates a signaling cascade, which inactivates the tumor-sup-

the MAPK pathway also becomes activated after vismodegib
treatment as Shh-dependent basal cell cancer transitions to squamous cell cancer resistant to Smo inhibitors. Together, these
results indicate that reactivation of the Shh pathway or interactions between Shh and MAPK pathways can alter tumor behavior
and therapeutic responses. Therefore, future treatments must
consider these distinct mechanisms of tumor evolution.

Materials and Methods
Detailed description is given in Supplemental Materials.
Animals
All experimental procedures were done in accordance with the
NIH guidelines and approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ptchþ/ mice (The Jackson
Laboratory; ref. 2). nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories).
Human studies
All human subjects work was reviewed by the Institutional
Review Board Committees of Brigham and Women's Hospital
and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, and
Stanford University for appropriate use, that informed consent
was obtained from all subjects when required, and appropriate
waiver of consent requirements was obtained for minimal risk
studies.
SMB cell culture
Shh-subtype medulloblastoma (SMB) cells were cultured as
neurospheres in DMEM/F12 media (2% B27, 1% Pen/Strep).
SMB(GF) cells were generated by culturing parental SMB cells for
3 weeks with the above media supplemented with EGF, bFGF
(20 ng/mL each), 0.2% heparin.
Cell survival assays
SMB cells in 96-well plates (3  104 cells/well) were incubated
for 72 hours in LDE225, vismodegib, LEQ506 or ATO, or for 120
hours in BKM120, BEZ235, PD325901, or CI-1040. Viability was
measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega),
and calculated as the percentage of control (DMSO treated).
Gene copy number analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue
Kit (Qiagen). Genomic copy number for Sufu was determined by
qPCR with custom-designed primers using 5 ng of genomic DNA/
reaction. Copy number was calculated as described in Supplemental Information.
Immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and
immunoblotting
Human medulloblastoma and matched metastases were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), or with anti-pERK1/2 (Cell
Signaling Technology; 1:400), visualized using the Envision Plus
Detection Kit (DAKO). Human skin tumors were immunostained
with: anti-Keratin14(ab7800; Abcam); anti-Gli1 (C-18; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); anti-pERK (#9101; Cell Signaling Technology).
Immunoreactivity was visualized with Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies and confocal microscopy (Leica SP8). Staining antibodies:
Ki67 (Leica Microsystems; 1:400), Nestin (Abcam; 1:400), Tuj1
(Covance; 1:400), GFP (Aves Labs; 1:1,000), and Zic (made in
house, 1:400; ref. 15). Immunoblot antibodies: pAKT (S473), AKT,

V5-tag (Invitrogen; 1:1,000).
Transplantation and in vivo treatment
A total of 5  106 cells in 100 mL were injected s.c. in ﬂank of
nu/nu mice (6–8 weeks old). Tumor volumes (V ¼ 0.5  A  B2)
were measured twice/week. When tumors reached 150 mm3,
animals were randomly grouped for treatment with vehicle or
LDE225 (diphosphate salt in 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.5% Tween
80, at 80 mg/kg by oral gavage once daily). Mice with tumors
2,000 mm3 were euthanized. For orthotopic tumors, 1  106
cells in 2 mL were injected into cerebella of nu/nu mice (6–8 weeks
old). Animals were sacriﬁced when symptomatic.
Skin tumor sequencing
Sequencing of clinical samples was performed under Institutional Review Board-approval at Stanford University. Medically
qualiﬁed patients 18 years or older with advanced BCCs were
enrolled and informed consent was obtained for tumor sequencing (protocol #18325). Tissue samples were stored in RNALater at
20 C (Ambion). DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit. Capture libraries were constructed from 2 mg DNA from
BCC and normal skin using the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All
Exon V4 Kit. Enriched exome libraries were multiplexed and
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to generate 100-bp
paired-end reads. Sequencing reads were aligned to human reference genome sequence (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner.
SAM to BAM conversion and marking of PCR duplicates were
performed using Picard tools (version 1.86), followed by local
realignment around indels and base quality score recalibration
using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; v2.3.9). Mean target
coverage was 114X over coding regions. Somatic SNVs and indels
were called using GATK. Variants were annotated for standard
quality metrics and for presence in dbSNP138.
Accession numbers
The microarray data accession number is GSE69359.

Results
SMB cell lines maintain features of Shh-subtype
medulloblastoma
Studies of Shh-dependent tumors have been limited by the lack
of appropriate tumor cell lines. To establish new Shh pathway–
dependent tumor cell lines, we propagated tumor cells from
spontaneous medulloblastoma of Ptchþ/ mice as neurospheres
(2). To retain Shh pathway dependency, we omitted EGF and
bFGF from the media as these growth factors (GF) can promote
differentiation of granule cell precursors (GCP), cells of origin for
Shh-subtype medulloblastoma (16, 17). Several tumor samples
tested (7 of 35, or 20%) grew for many passages and were
designated SMB lines. The three most stable lines, SMB21, SMB55,
and SMB56, were used in this study.
SMB lines are tumorigenic and retain key characteristics of in
vivo Shh-subtype medulloblastoma. SMB cells are small (5 mm
in diameter) and exhibit a morphology similar to cerebellar GCPs.
These tumor-derived cells express medulloblastoma markers,
including stem cell/progenitor marker Nestin, neuronal marker

medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, group C, group D; ref. 18). Similarity to each subtype for each sample is deﬁned by the "signature
score," which quantitatively measures similarity of gene-expression patterns to predeﬁned signature genes. Subtype signature
score indicates that SMB cells and in vivo primary medulloblastoma both closely resembled Shh-subtype medulloblastoma
(Fig. 1C). We used a second algorithm, agreement of differential
expression (AGDEX; ref. 19), to compare SMB cells with human
medulloblastoma. AGDEX analysis also indicates that both
Ptchþ/ primary medulloblastoma and SMB cells exhibit the
highest agreement with human SHH subtype (Supplementary
Fig. S1F). Notably, activated Shh signaling in SMB cells is exquisitely sensitive to Smo inhibitors, as demonstrated by reduced
Gli1 mRNA and protein following treatment with Smo inhibitor
LDE225 (Fig. 1D and E). Importantly, proliferation and survival
of SMB cells also depend on active Shh signaling as demonstrated
in cell survival assays with three different Smo inhibitors LDE225,
vismodegib, and LEQ506 (20). These inhibitors reduce cell number in all SMB lines, and increase apoptosis as assessed by
activated caspase-3 (Fig. 1E and F; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
SMB cells, even after more than 20 passages in culture,
initiate tumors in vivo when transplanted into nude mice, either
subcutaneously or as orthotopic xenografts in the brain (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Transplanted SMB cells exhibit typical
Shh-subtype histology (Supplementary Fig. S1C–S1E). Recent
sequencing studies of large cohorts of medulloblastoma
patients revealed that p53 is among the most frequently mutated genes in Shh-subtype medulloblastoma (10%–20%; refs. 21,
22). To evaluate p53 status in our SMB cells, we ﬁrst sequenced
coding exons of p53. Y233C and C138R point mutations were
detected in SMB21 and SMB55 cells, respectively, but no
mutations were detected in SMB56 cells. However, other alterations can impinge on p53 activity. All three SMB lines showed
elevated levels of p53 protein compared with wild-type murine
neural progenitor cells, and p53 expression in SMB cells did not
change in response to gamma irradiation (Supplementary Fig.
S1G), indicating that the p53 signaling axis is dysregulated in
all SMB lines. Together, these data indicate that our culturing
protocol can establish Shh-subtype cell lines with dysregulated
p53, and these lines can be used to study Shh-subtype medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo and provide a platform for rapid,
large-scale functional study and drug screening.
SMB cell lines provide a model to study drug resistance
A major concern with Smo inhibitors or other targeted therapies is the emergence of drug resistance. To determine whether
SMB cell lines can help address this challenge, we asked whether
the effects of known resistance mechanisms, such as Smo mutants
(D477G, L225R, and S391N) and Gli2 overexpression, can be
recapitulated in SMB cells. To achieve stable expression of exogenous genes, we adapted the piggyBac transposon system to
integrate exogenous genes into the SMB genome (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). SMB21 cells stably expressing GFP, Smo(WT), Smo
(D477G), Smo(L225R), Smo(S391N), Gli2, or Gli2DN, constitutively active Gli2 lacking the amino-terminal repressor domain
(23), were tested for sensitivity to LDE225 in a cell survival assay.
Although cells expressing GFP or Smo(WT) remain sensitive to
Smo inhibitors LDE225, LEQ506, or vismodegib, cells expressing
Smo mutants, Gli2, or Gli2DN are resistant to Smo inhibitors (Fig.
2A; Supplementary Fig. S2B–S2D). Consistent with previous
studies, cells expressing Smo mutants or Gli2DN exhibit consti-

3626 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

tutively activated Shh signaling even in the presence of LDE225, as
demonstrated by Gli1 expression (Fig. 2B).
To test resistance of engineered SMB cells in vivo, SMB21
parental, Smo(WT), Smo(D477G), and Gli2DN cells were
subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice. Although SMB21
parental and Smo(WT)-expressing cells form tumors responsive to LDE225 in vivo, cells expressing Smo(D477G) or
Gli2DN generate tumors resistant to LDE225 (Fig. 2C). Together, these results indicate that mutations that confer clinical
resistance to LDE225 are effective in SMB cells, demonstrating
that these lines provide attractive systems for studying drug
resistance.
Identiﬁcation of novel routes for circumventing Smo inhibition
To identify novel routes through which medulloblastoma
cells can escape Smo inhibition, we used SMB cells to test three
groups of candidates. The ﬁrst group includes key Shh pathway
components downstream of Smo: Sufu, Gli1, Gli3, and Nmyc.
We used the piggyBac transposon system to overexpress Gli1,
Gli3, or Nmyc, or used shRNA to knockdown Sufu. Unlike Gli2,
expression of Gli1, Gli3, or Nmyc in SMB cells cannot bypass
Smo inhibition, reactivate Shh signaling, or promote proliferation and survival in cells treated with LDE225 (Supplementary
Fig. S2D and S2F). In contrast, shRNA knockdown of Sufu
reactivates Shh signaling and confers robust resistance to
LDE225 in SMB cells (Fig. 3A and B). Consistent with the key
role of Sufu, several of the resistant tumors that arose spontaneously from subcutaneously implanted SMB cells following
treatment with LDE225 showed drastic reduction of Sufu
protein levels compared with sensitive tumors not exposed to
LDE225 (Fig. 3C), and many exhibited genomic loss of Sufu
(Fig. 3D). To identify possible treatment for tumors that are
resistant due to Sufu loss, we tested arsenic trioxide (ATO), an
FDA-approved drug shown to antagonize Gli action (24). ATO
inhibits proliferation of SMB cells and Sufu knockdown cells
with an effective dose similar to previous studies (Fig. 3E;
ref. 24). Together, these data indicate that Gli inhibitors can
treat intrinsic Shh pathway activation.
In addition to Shh pathway–speciﬁc components, we tested
molecules that are key drivers of WNT and group 3 (MYC)
medulloblastoma subtypes (25). Neither expression of wild-type
nor constitutively activated form of CTNNB1, CTNNB1(S33Y),
nor overexpression of stabilized MYC, MYC(T58A), confer resistance to Smo inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S2F–S2I). Thus,
oncogenic mutations critical for other medulloblastoma subtypes
cannot alter subtype identity, and thereby confer resistance.
Recent studies indicate that WNT and Shh-subtype medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins, as Shh-subtype medulloblastoma originate from GCPs and WNT subtype from dorsal brainstem cells (26). Thus, the cellular context may explain why
signaling pathways driving other medulloblastoma subtypes fail
to confer Smo-inhibitor resistance.
The third group of candidates tested encompassed genes
involved in RTK/RAS signaling, as RTK/RAS signaling is implicated in development of normal cerebellar GCPs and medulloblastoma (27, 28). Expression of HRAS(G12V) or BRAF
(V600E), but not PI3KCA(H1047R) or AKT(Myristoylated),
induced resistance to LDE225 in SMB cells (Fig. 4A–C; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3C). As expected, both HRAS(G12V)
and BRAF(V600E) activate the MAPK pathway in SMB cells, as
demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 4A0 ;

and vismodegib, indicating that this effect is generalizable for
Smo antagonists (Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). SMB
(HRAS) cells subcutaneously transplanted in nude mice were
resistant to treatment with Smo inhibitors (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, MAPK activation is greater in SMB tumors that spontaneously develop resistance to Smo inhibitors following treatment with LDE225 than in vehicle treated, sensitive tumors
(Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that activation of
RAS/MAPK provides a novel way for cells to evade Smo
inhibition.
Surprisingly, HRAS(G12V) does not confer resistance by reactivating Shh signaling downstream of Smo (Fig. 5A). Instead,
HRAS(G12V) suppresses Shh signaling in SMB cells, as expression
of multiple Shh pathway targets and components are downregulated in SMB(HRAS) cells (Fig. 5A–C; Supplementary Fig.

medulloblastoma that is not a direct target of SHH signaling, is
decreased in SMB(HRAS) cells. These results suggest that HRAS
renders SMB cells independent of Shh-signaling for growth, and
thereby causes resistance.
RAS is normally regulated by upstream GFs and receptor
tyrosine kinases, and so receptor activation might mimic the
effects of HRAS in SMB cells. During normal cerebellar GCP
development, GF, such as bFGF, antagonize Shh pathway activity
and promote differentiation (29, 30). When SMB cells were
exposed to GFs that are common components of stem cell media
(bFGF and EGF; 20 ng/mL) both PI3K–AKT and RAS–RAF-MAPK
pathways were activated, Shh signaling was suppressed, and SMB
cells became resistant to LDE225 (Fig. 5D–G). We tested the GFs
individually, and found that bFGF, not EGF, suppresses Shh
signaling and causes resistance (Supplementary Fig. S4E and
S4F). Together, these results demonstrate that sustained activation
of FGF/RAS/RAF signaling enables Shh-subtype medulloblastoma to grow in a Shh pathway–independent manner.

bitors, we removed oncogenic HRAS from SMB(HRAS) cells using
lentiviral delivered Flp to cleave FRT sites within the transposon
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Removal of RAS decreases Erk
phosphorylation and restores Shh signaling activity and susceptibility to Smo inhibitors (Fig. 6A–C). Similarly, cells resistant to
Smo inhibitors due to prolonged bFGF treatment regained Shh
signaling activity and susceptibility to Smo inhibitors when bFGF
was removed from media for prolonged time periods (Fig. 6D and
E). Together, these data indicate that prolonged activation of FGF/
RAS/MAPK signaling both initiates and maintains Shh-signaling
independence and resistance to Smo inhibitors.
To identify therapeutic approaches for treating SMB cells resistant to Smo inhibitors, we tested PI3K and MEK pathway inhibitors. Although HRAS cells showed similar sensitivity as SMB
parental cells to PI3K inhibitors BEZ235 and BKM120, they were
much more sensitive to MEK inhibitors CI-1040 and PD325901.
Thus, MEK inhibitors provide therapeutic treatment for resistant
tumors driven by activation of FGF/RAS/RAF signaling (Fig. 6F
and G; Supplementary Figs. S5C–S5E, S6).

RAS/MAPK activation alters characteristics of Shh pathway–
dependent tumors
Morphologically, SMB(HRAS) cells exhibit a dramatically different appearance from SMB parental cells. SMB parental cells are
small, with little cytoplasmic material, whereas SMB(HRAS) cells
appear larger with extended cellular processes (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Immunohistochemical characterization revealed that
SMB(HRAS) cells are proliferative, as indicated by Ki67, and
poorly differentiated, as indicated by Nestin, a stem cell/progenitor marker (Fig. 7A).
The striking morphologic differences in SMB(HRAS) cells suggests that they may be more motile than parental cells. Indeed
these cells were more invasive when tested in a Matrigel invasion
assay (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, when SMB(HRAS) cells were s.c.
injected in nude mice, they initiated resistant tumors, and also
generated lung metastases in 2 of 9 mice. Metastases, were never
found in 8 mice injected with SMB cells (Fig. 7C and D). Together,
these data indicate that activation of RAS/MAPK increases tumor
invasiveness.
Clinical observations from a rare set of matched primary and
metastatic lesions from an individual patient provide additional
evidence that RAS activation promotes metastasis in medulloblastoma, as the primary lesion exhibits low level of MAPK
activation, whereas the metastatic frontal lobe lesion exhibits
robust MAPK activation (Fig. 7E and F). In human primary
Shh-subtype medulloblastoma, most areas are predominantly
negative for MAPK activation (Supplementary Fig. S8, Table
S2); however, in one tumor, cancer cells in the perivascular niche
were strikingly positive for ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S8D) whereas in a desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma,
ERK phosphorylation was elevated in perinodular regions (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Both tumors exhibited regions with high
FGF immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8D). Cells
with MAPK activation within human Shh-subtype medulloblastomas may generate resistant tumors when challenged by Smo
inhibitors.

medulloblastoma. Among BCC patients, approximately 21%
that initially respond subsequently develop tumors resistant to
this inhibitor (31). In some cases, posttreatment resistant tumors
exhibit characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; refs. 32–
36). We analyzed three patients who developed SCC at the site of
the antecedent BCC tumor following treatment with vismodegib.
Posttreatment resistant tumors display low level of Gli1 and high
level of phospho-ERK, suggesting upregulated RAS/MAPK and
downregulated Shh signaling (Fig. 7G). To determine whether
SCCs that develop following vismodegib are derived from the
antecedent BCC in the same location, we analyzed patientmatched normal tissue or blood, and pre- and post-relapse

tumor samples by exome sequencing with germline and dbSNP
variants removed. Tumors we assayed initially responded to
vismodegib before acquiring resistance to the inhibitor. Strikingly, 91% of genetic variations (n ¼ 1248) in the SCC sample
were shared between pretreatment BCC and posttreatment SCC,
whereas only 3% and 6% of somatic genetic variations (n ¼ 43
and n ¼ 84) were unique to the SCC or shared with patientmatched normal sample, respectively, suggesting that the SCC
arose from the BCC (Fig. 7H). These results suggest that tumors
can evolve from Shh pathway–dependent BCC to the RAS–
MAPK pathway–dependent SCCs, and thereby develop resistance to Smo inhibitors.

RAS Drives Drug Resistance and Tumor Evolution in Shh Tumors

and discovering novel therapies. Investigation of medulloblastoma biology has been limited by the lack of stable lines that are
tumorigenic and Shh pathway dependent. Most established
medulloblastoma lines, are adherent cell cultures maintained in
serum-containing media, and do not depend on the Shh pathway
for growth and survival (6, 14). Current protocols can only culture
freshly isolated tumor cells for a short time before key characteristics of Shh-subtype medulloblastoma are lost. Here, we present
Shh pathway–dependent medulloblastoma lines (SMB) that can
be used as effective and faithful in vitro models to study Shhsubtype medulloblastoma.
The protocol that enabled development of SMB lines is a
modiﬁed version of neural stem cell culture methods. Key aspects
include growing cells as nonadherent spheres and eliminating
serum, EGF and bFGF from media. Generation of tumor spheres is
commonly used to enrich for cancer stem-like cells (37). Indeed
high-grade gliomas can be perpetuated as neurospheres by maintaining cells in neural stem cell media with EGF and bFGF (37,
38). However, these conditions do not maintain tumorigenicity
and Shh pathway dependency of medulloblastoma cells (39), as
FGF signaling has an antagonistic effect on Shh signaling (29,
30, 40). Instead, medulloblastoma neurospheres from Ptchþ/
mice cultured without exogenous EGF or bFGF generate Shhsubtype medulloblastoma cell lines (SMB) that are tumorigenic,
maintain markers of Shh-subtype medulloblastoma and remain
dependent on Shh pathway activity even after many passages
in vitro.
A previous study isolated rare lines from medulloblastomas
of Ptchþ/;p53/ mice (41). We observe distinct modes of p53
signaling dysregulation in each SMB line. Because all three lines
are derived from Ptchþ/;p53þ/þ mice, mutations or inactivation of p53 signaling may have developed during primary
medulloblastoma tumorigenesis in each individual animal. In
human medulloblastoma, the importance of p53 has become
increasingly apparent. Among human medulloblastoma, p53
mutations were detected in 13% to 21% of Shh-subtype MBs
(21, 22). We conclude that SMB cells offer a faithful model for
investigating the Shh pathway in medulloblastoma, and facilitate high-throughput drug testing and large-scale functional
screens. In the future, a similar approach might enable generation of human Shh pathway–dependent medulloblastoma
lines.
Mechanisms of resistance to Smo inhibition
Several Smo inhibitors show promise in preclinical and clinical
studies. Vismodegib was the ﬁrst drug of this class approved by the
FDA to treat BCCs. In one study, 6 of 28 BCC patients treated with
vismodegib developed resistance to Smo inhibitors (31). Here, we
demonstrate that Sufu mutation can occur after treatment with
Smo inhibitors, and cause secondary resistance by activating Shh
signaling downstream of Smo. As loss of Sufu generates medulloblastomas that never respond to Smo inhibition (21, 42), this
ﬁnding provides proof of principle that clinically relevant resistance mechanisms can be studied in SMB cells.
Data that overexpression of Gli1 or Nmyc does not confer
resistance to Smo inhibition may seem surprising. However, Gli2
is the primary activator of the Shh signaling pathway in GCP
development and medulloblastoma, whereas Gli1 is not essential
(43, 44). In preclinical and clinical settings, ampliﬁcation and
constitutive activation of Gli2 generates Shh-subtype medulloblastoma resistant to Smo inhibition (5, 12, 21). In a recent study

www.aacrjournals.org

of human Shh-subtype medulloblastoma (n ¼ 133), 10 cases of
Gli2 ampliﬁcation were identiﬁed, but no cases of Gli1 ampliﬁcation were seen (21). Therefore, our results with overexpression
of Gli transcription factors are consistent with clinical observations. In contrast, Nmyc ampliﬁcation is reported in Shh-subtype
medulloblastoma that do not respond to Smo inhibition (21).
Although we cannot exclude the possibility that higher expression
achieved by other means might confer resistance, our results
suggest that other genetic changes may be needed in conjunction
with Nmyc for tumors to grow in the presence of Smo inhibitors.
An important ﬁnding of this study is identiﬁcation of a Shh
pathway–independent mechanism of resistance. RAS-mediated
resistance involves shifting oncogenic addiction to a second
oncogenic pathway. De novo mutations or a microenvironment
with abundant GF can stimulate RAS/MAPK signaling, eliminate
Shh pathway dependency, and cause resistance in medulloblastoma. Indeed, in human medulloblastoma, components of the
RTK–RAS–MAPK pathway are often overexpressed (27), and
epigenetic inactivation of RAS association domain family 1A
(RASSF1A) tumor-suppressor gene is frequently observed (45,
46). Although de novo RAS/RAF mutations have not been detected
in primary human medulloblastoma, such mutations might be
favored following treatment with Smo inhibitors (28), as mutations that confer resistance are often only detected following
treatment with targeted therapies (11, 47). Strikingly in our
studies, xenografts with spontaneous resistance to Smo inhibitors
display activation of ERK signaling in vivo. Thus, our data indicate
that GF stimulation, genetic or epigenetic changes affecting the
RAS–RAF–MEK pathway should be assessed in patients that
develop resistance to Smo inhibitors.
In addition to intrinsic mutations in tumor cells, tumor microenvironment may alter drug efﬁcacy (48). Our study suggests that
microenvironments with abundant FGF could provide protective
niches for cells exposed to Smo inhibitors. We show that in
human medulloblastoma, ERK activation occurs in locations
adjacent to blood vessels or in perinodular spaces. Recent work
suggested that stromal production of placental GF (PlGF) in
human medulloblastoma promotes cancer cell survival by activating the MAPK cascade (49). Thus, paracrine PlGF-mediated
RAS/MAPK signaling could also attenuate efﬁcacy of Smo
inhibitors.
Cross-talk between Shh and FGFR/RAS signaling has been
widely recognized during organogenesis in multiple tissues
(50, 51). Depending on biologic context, interactions between
FGF/RAS and Shh pathways can be synergistic or antagonistic. In
cerebellar GCPs and Ptchþ/ medulloblastoma cells, acute bFGF
treatment suppresses Shh signaling and proliferation, and concomitantly promotes cell differentiation (29, 30). Similarly,
oncogenic RAS can block Shh signaling in NIH3T3 cells and
pancreatic cancer models (52). Here, we again observe an antagonistic relationship between Shh and FGF/RAS signaling in SMB
cells. Importantly, however, this process does not promote terminal differentiation; instead tumor cells remain proliferative and
tumorigenic.
RAS/MAPK signaling in metastasis and tumor evolution
Strikingly, RAS/MAPK activation alters multiple characteristics
of Shh-dependent tumors. Morphologic and transcriptional proﬁles of SMB(HRAS) cells differ from SMB cells; although SMB cells
are small with classic medulloblastoma histology, SMB(HRAS)
cells display an extended morphology, are more invasive in vitro

and more metastatic in vivo. Comparison of Shh-subtype primary
medulloblastoma and matched metastatic lesions from the same
person, reveal high level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in metastases.
Consistent with our ﬁndings, ectopic expression of Eras (embryonic stem cell–expressed Ras), which is structurally similar to RAS
oncoprotein (53), increases leptomeningeal metastases in models
of Shh-subtype medulloblastoma, and these metastatic cells differ
genetically and epigenetically from primary tumor cells (54, 55).
Together, these data indicate that RAS activation results in resistance to Smo inhibitors and alters tumor characteristics.
Clinical studies of resistant BCC also suggest a role of RAS/MAPK
in tumor evolution. Several studies have reported occurrences
of SCCs during treatment of BCC with vismodegib (32–36).
Sequencing of matched pre- and posttreatment skin tumor samples
supports the hypothesis that BCC tumors activate RTK/RAS/MAPK
signaling and generate SCCs under selective pressure by Smo
inhibition (56). Thus, our ﬁndings indicate a novel scenario of
resistance by which Shh pathway–dependent tumor cells evolve
and escape Shh signaling dependence. Future studies are required
