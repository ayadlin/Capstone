Abstract
Development of drug resistance is a major factor limiting
the continued success of cancer chemotherapy. To overcome
drug resistance, understanding the underlying mechanism(s)
is essential. We found that HOXC10 is overexpressed in
primary carcinomas of the breast, and even more signiﬁcantly
in distant metastasis arising after failed chemotherapy. High
HOXC10 expression correlates with shorter recurrence-free
and overall survival in patients with estrogen receptor–
negative breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. We found
that HOXC10 promotes survival in cells treated with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or carboplatin by suppressing apoptosis and
upregulating NF-kB. Overexpressed HOXC10 increases Sphase–speciﬁc DNA damage repair by homologous recombination (HR) and checkpoint recovery in cells at three impor-

Introduction
Many chemotherapeutic agents induce DNA damage, triggering cells to activate their DNA damage repair machinery. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major DNA repair pathway that
mediates repair of DNA adducts that cause inter- or intrastrand
cross links (ICL) and the formation of pyrimidine dimers. Alkylating- and platinum-based agents often induce bulky DNA
damage that is repaired via NER.

tant phases. For double-strand break repair, HOXC10 recruits
HR proteins at sites of DNA damage. It enhances resection and
lastly, it resolves stalled replication forks, leading to initiation
of DNA replication following DNA damage. We show that
HOXC10 facilitates, but is not directly involved in DNA
damage repair mediated by HR. HOXC10 achieves integration
of these functions by binding to, and activating cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK7, which regulates transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase
II. Consistent with these ﬁndings, inhibitors of CDK7 reverse
HOXC10-mediated drug resistance in cultured cells. Blocking
HOXC10 function, therefore, presents a promising new strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer.

Large scale interaction screens as well as reciprocal afﬁnity
puriﬁcations have been instrumental in identifying several HOX
proteins that interact with proteins critical for DNA damage repair
processes (reviewed in ref. 1). HOXB7 associates with Ku70,
Ku80, and DNA-Pkcs (2), and with PARP1 (3), whose polyADP-ribosylation activity enhances the kinase activity of DNAPK at the initiation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
Recent evidence supports HOX protein participation in the cell
replication machinery by associations at DNA replication origins
(4). HOXC10 is one such example (5, 6); HOXC10 also has
important functions in tissue regeneration (7). Recently, loss of
HOXC10 expression was implicated in the development of resistance to estrogen response modulators in estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancer (8). At the present time, the function of
HOXC10 in breast cancer remains poorly understood.
Here, we report that HOXC10 expression is frequently higher in
ER-negative breast carcinomas that are also chemotherapy resistant. We determined that HOXC10 contributes to chemoresistance through suppression of apoptosis and enhanced DNA
damage repair, mediated through direct interaction with, and
activation of CDK7. We also show that CDK7 inhibition can
reverse chemotherapy resistance.

cells/100 mL PBS/Matrigel (1:1), and were treated with doxorubicin (4 mg/kg BW/i.v./weekly) or paclitaxel (10 mg/kg BW/i.p./
weekly).
Growth assay
Cells were grown in 12-well plates (2,000 cells/well), ﬁxed with
formalin, and stained with crystal violet. To quantitate growth, the
dye was solubilized by 10% acetic acid, and absorbance was
measured at 560 nmol/L.
Flow cytometry analysis
Cells at 70% to 80% conﬂuence or after double thymidine
synchronization were collected, permeabilized, pelleted, and

Results
HOXC10 overexpression is linked to chemotherapy
resistance
By HOX tiling mRNA expression array, compared with normal breast, HOXC10 was among the top ﬁve overexpressed
genes in breast cancer (23), and higher than all 39 HOX genes
in distant metastasis (Fig. 1A). In Oncomine (24), HOXC10 was
among the top 1% transcripts in breast compared with other
carcinomas (Fig. 1B), and in TCGA (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/), was equally prevalent in all breast carcinomas (Fig. 1C).
qRT-PCR analysis of our primary tissue panel validated this
ﬁnding; median HOXC10 expression was 10-fold higher in
primary invasive carcinomas and 30- fold higher in distant
metastatic tissues (Fig. 1D). No correlation of HOXC10 expression with relapse-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS)
was observed in breast cancer patients in the GEO (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and the METABRIC cohorts (Fig. 1E, a
and F, a; ref. 25). In chemotherapy treated patients, high
HOXC10 expression correlated with short RFS (Fig. 1E, b and
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) and short OS (Fig. 1F, b and
Supplementary Fig. S1C), and even more consistently in
the subset of ER-negative patients treated with chemotherapy
(Fig. 1E, c and F, c). Cox multivariate regression analysis, taking
all clinical parameters into account, revealed a highly signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.00013) inverse correlation between HOXC10
expression and RFS.
HOXC10 is induced during development of chemotherapy
resistance
As a ﬁrst step to investigating the contribution of HOXC10 to
drug resistance, we analyzed HOXC10 expression in chemotherapy-resistant MCF7-sublines (9) that displayed resistance (>250fold) to epirubicin, paclitaxel and docetaxel. HOXC10 was
expressed at 2- to 8-fold higher levels in MCF-7- R sublines (Fig.
2A) and in newly developed MDA-MB-231-R sublines that
emerged (>30 days) following exposure to drugs (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Depleting HOXC10 levels in MCF-7-Tax-R subline
restored its response to paclitaxel (Fig. 2B). Further studies were
carried out in eight breast cancer cell lines with varying levels of
HOXC10 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B). On exposure of cells
in culture to drugs, induction of HOXC10 expression was rapid,
starting at day 1 in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2C), SUM159 (Fig. 2D),
and SUM149 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Basal levels of HOXC10
expression determined response to Dox. Mouse xenografts of
low HOXC10-expressing MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2E) responded to
Dox signiﬁcantly better than high HOXC10-expressing SUM159
(Fig. 2F) or HCC1954 (Supplementary Fig. S2D). By qRT-PCR,
MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2G) and SUM149 (Supplementary Fig. S2E)
tumors that resumed growth during treatment showed signiﬁcantly higher HOXC10 expression compared with SUM159 (Fig.
2H) and HCC1954 (Supplementary Fig. S2F) supporting the
argument that upregulated HOXC10 expression correlated with
resistance to chemotherapy.
HOXC10 overexpression decreases susceptibility to
chemotherapy
To characterize the effects of HOXC10 overexpression, we
derived stable clones of MCF10A-Ras [stably expressing K-ras
(Gly12-Val)] and MDA-MB-231–overexpressing myc-tagged
HOXC10, and SUM159 and SUM149 cells depleted of HOXC10

HOXC10 Facilitates DNA Repair and Chemoresistance

by 50% to 70% (immunoblot in Fig. 3A) using speciﬁc shRNAs.
Properties of anchorage-independent growth (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B), colony formation (Supplementary Fig.
S3C), invasion through Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. S3D), proliferation (Supplementary Fig. SE), quantiﬁed in (Supplementary
Fig. S3F), and tumor growth in mice (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S3G) were all signiﬁcantly decreased by depleting HOXC10
and enhanced by overexpressing HOXC10 in tumor cells. By
colony survival assays, Dox, gemcitabine, carboplatin, and Tax
were more cytotoxic in SUM159-shC10 (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3H), MCF7-shC10 and SUM149-shC10 (Supplementary Fig. S3H) than in MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3I). This body of data, supporting an increased oncogenicity and
aggressiveness of HOXC10-expressing breast cancer cells, was
further corroborated by MTT assays in SUM159-shC10 (Supplementary Fig. S3J) and in MCF10A-Ras-10 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3K).
The activation of caspase-3/7 is a reliable marker of cells
undergoing apoptosis (26). Susceptibility to the drugs was
reﬂected by an increase in caspase 3/7 activity in SUM159-shC10
cells (Fig. 3D) and a decrease in MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells (Fig. 3E).
Apoptotic cells were identiﬁed on the basis of DNA content
frequency histograms as cells with fractional "sub-G1" DNA
content (27). In response to Dox, there was a decrease in subG1 population in SUM159shC10 cells (Fig. 3F) and an increase in
MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells (Fig. 3G). Also, several pro- and antiapoptotic mRNAs were modulated in SUM159-shC10 and
MCF10A-Ras (Supplementary Fig. S3L and S3M), and further
intensiﬁed by drug treatment (Fig. 3H and Supplementary Fig.
S3N). Western blot analysis of SUM159-shC10 cells showed that
antiapoptotic genes, hsp27, Birc 3, PI3K, and BCL2 levels were
decreased, whereas proapoptotic genes, p21, and BID levels were
increased by depletion of HOXC10 (Fig. 3I). Dox-treated
MCF10A-Ras-vec xenografts regressed by week 4, whereas
MCF10A-Ras-C10 tumors grew after week 2 (Fig. 3J). Consistent
with this observation, MCF10A-Ras-C10 tumors showed high
mRNA expression of many antiapoptotic genes (Fig. 3K).
Given that the antiapoptotic genes examined are known direct
targets of NF-kB (28), we measured NF-kB activity using the NFkB–responsive reporter Igk2-IFN-LUC, with and without Dox
treatment. The basal activity of NF-kB was lower in SUM159shC10 (Supplementary Fig. S3O) and high in MCF10A-Ras-C10
(Supplementary Fig. S3P) compared with their respective controls,
and further enhanced by Dox treatment. These data are consistent
with ﬁndings that the basal activity of NF-kB is much higher, and
maintained as such, in Dox-resistant MCF7 cells (29). Thus,
HOXC10 upregulates NF-kB to achieve both activation of antiapoptotic pathways, and increases cell survival following stress.
HOXC10 enhances DNA damage repair and checkpoint
recovery
Several homeodomain-related proteins have been functionally
related to DNA damage repair (1, 2, 30, 31). Overexpression of

HOXA5 in S. cerevisiae upregulates components of the mismatch
repair (MMR) system, important for the detection and repair of
DNA damage (32). Hence, we investigated whether HOXC10
participates directly in DNA repair and if so, the type of damage
and cell-cycle stage of repair.
A host–cell reactivation assay was used to assess cellular
ability to repair exogenously damaged DNA. A pGL3 (luciferase-reporter) plasmid was exposed to UV or cisplatin, or
digested with Hind III (to generate double-strand breaks, DSB)
followed by transfection into SUM159-shC10 cells or MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells and their respective controls. SUM159shC10 cells displayed a signiﬁcantly decreased ability to repair
DNA damage (Fig. 4A), whereas the reverse was shown for UVinduced DNA damage in MCF-10A-Ras-C10 cells (Fig. 4B).
Clonogenic cell survival assays in both MCF10A-Ras-C10 and
SUM159-shC10 cells exposed to UV (Fig. 4C, quantiﬁed
in S4A) supported these ﬁndings. However, repair of DNA
DSBs caused by Hind III digestion (Fig. 4A) remained
unchanged in SUM159-shC10 cells, suggesting no involvement of the NHEJ pathway. Furthermore, ionizing radiation
(IR) induced G1-chromosome damage repair was not affected
in SUM159-shC10 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B), wherein
DSB repair by NHEJ is predominant. On the other hand,
SUM159-shC10 cells had a higher frequency of S-phase–speciﬁc IR-induced chromosomal aberrations (Supplementary
Fig. S4C), suggesting that HOXC10 expression enhances
repair, possibly by the homologous recombination (HR)
pathway. MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells treated with cisplatin showed
signiﬁcantly reduced number of cells with chromosomal aberrations at metaphase (Supplementary Fig. S4D) compared
with the vector control cells. Collectively, the data strongly
support the hypothesis that HOXC10 is an important participant in DNA DSB repair by HR.
We had noted that HOXC10 expression had a dramatic effect
on survival following exposure to UV light or the platinum
drugs (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary S4A). DNA damage
induced by such agents is repaired by nucleotide excision repair
(NER) and HR. Therefore, we measured the activity of the NER
pathway by the alkaline comet assay (Fig. 4D), a single-cell gel
electrophoresis method in which the intensity of the comet tail
of the migrating cells relative to the head reﬂects the number of
DNA breaks (33). Cells depleted of HOXC10 had signiﬁcantly
more residual UV-, Dox- and gemcitabine-induced DNA damage 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, timecourse analysis after UV treatment showed that DNA damage
in SUM159-scr cells had returned to baseline levels in 24 hours,
but was still 4-fold higher in SUM159-shC10 cells (Fig. 4E),
revealing inefﬁcient DNA repair in the absence of HOXC10.
Improved response to DNA damage was evident in MCF10ARas-C10 cells compared with the vector-control cells (Fig. 4B, C,
and F). The reduced survival of SUM159-shC10 cells in colony
formation assays (Fig. 4C) also correlated with higher levels of
residual DSBs.

HOXC10 Facilitates DNA Repair and Chemoresistance

DNA damage that results in DSBs is always followed by the
phosphorylation of the histone, H2AX (34). Newly formed phosphorylated protein g-H2AX is the initial step of damage detection
to recruit repair proteins (34). We quantiﬁed the number of
residual g-H2AX foci 24 hours after treatment of SUM159-shC10
cells with Dox or gemcitabine. On average, 20% to 30% more
g-H2AX foci accumulated in SUM159-shC10 cells after drug
treatment (Fig. 4G) with almost 50% to 60% more cells displaying
100 foci/nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S4E). A time-course analysis of g-H2AX protein after UV or Dox treatment showed no
differences in the initial induction of g-H2AX (10 minutes to 8
hours; Supplementary Fig. S4F and S4G). Residual g-H2AX measured 24 hours after treatment, and not the initial kinetics of
g-H2AX formation, is a better predictor of cell viability (35, 36).
These results indicated that HOXC10 might be more involved in
DNA damage processing rather than in damage sensing. No major
difference was observed in the phosphorylation status of known
DNA damage sensors of the ATR/ATM pathways after Dox or
gemictabine treatment of SUM159-shC10 (Supplementary Fig.
S4H), thus conﬁrming that HOXC10 is not involved in DNA
damage sensing.
These ﬁndings were further substantiated by the HR-DSB repair
assay of lesions induced by I-Sce1 endonuclease performed in DR95 cells engineered to stably express a pDR-GFP plasmid containing a mutated GFP gene with an 18 bp I-Sce1 endonuclease
cleavage site and an in-frame termination codon (10, 20). Efﬁcient repair of the Sce-1 cleavage site restores expression of GFP.
DR-95 cells, with and without HOXC10 silencing (using siRNA)
were transfected with the I-Sce1 expression plasmid. DR95siHOXC10 showed reduced repair of I-Sce-1–induced lesions.
Consequently, restoration of GFP expression occurred at a significantly lower efﬁciency than in control cells (Fig. 4H). Reduction
of GFP expression was comparable with cells with reduced
expression of BRCA-1, a known DNA repair protein, used as a
positive control (Fig. 4H). Thus, repair of DSB by HR is impaired
in cells lacking HOXC10 expression.
To investigate a role of HOXC10 in the recruitment of HR repair
proteins at the site of a single DNA DSB, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in DR-95 cells (10, 20). We compared the levels of BRCA1, RAD51, KU80, and HOXC10 at
different distances from an I-Sce1–induced DSB site using ChIP
analysis with speciﬁc primers (10) in cells with and without
expression of HOXC10. Depletion of HOXC10 using siRNAs did
not decrease KU80 levels in close proximity to the DSB, whereas
levels of RAD51 and BRCA1 at the break site were signiﬁcantly
reduced (Fig. 4I). This ﬁnding in HOXC10-depleted cells strongly
supported the role of HOXC10 in facilitating the recruitment of
proteins involved in HR. However, HOXC10 itself was undetectable at the I-Sce1 cleavage site, ruling out a direct role for HOXC10
in DSB repair.

We therefore considered the possibility that HOXC10 has a role
in the initiation of new origins of DNA replication. Single-molecule examination of replication dynamics by DNA ﬁber analysis
(19) after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment in SUM159-shC10 and
MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells showed that HOXC10 is required for the
initiation of new origins, but not for the accumulation of stalled
forks (Fig. 4J and K).
Collectively, the data suggest that HOXC10, as a transcriptional factor, affects the chromatin status and sets the stage for
HR by, (i) decreasing S-phase chromosome aberrations, (ii)
enhancing resection as shown by g-H2AX foci, (iii) increasing
HR based on l-Scel endonuclease–induced DSB repair, and (iv)
resolving stalled replication forks as shown by DNA ﬁber
analysis, possibly leading to initiation of DNA replication
following DNA damage.
HOXC10 binds to CDK7 in vivo after chemotherapy treatment
We had thus far observed that HOXC10 enhances cell
survival by affecting apoptosis, NF-kB activity, and damage
repair, mainly by the HR pathways. One key protein that links
all three pathways is cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). In
metazoans, CDK7 has essential roles in transcription as a
component of the general transcription factor, TFIIH. CDK7
is an effector kinase, which also phosphorylates RNA Pol II and
other proteins during transcription after the pausing of the
TFIIH complex following DNA damage (37). Highly relevant
to this study, HOXC10 was found to be the tightest binding
protein linking the CAK (Cdk-activating kinase, CDK7) complex to TFIIH in a yeast 4-hybrid system (38). We therefore
tested for an association of HOXC10 with CDK7 by coimmunoprecipitation. A weak interaction between the two proteins
increased signiﬁcantly upon treatment with Dox and gemcitabine (Fig. 5A). This interaction was reduced signiﬁcantly
upon addition of a pharmacologic inhibitor of CDK7 activity,
SNS-032 (Fig. 5A), or by expressing the dominant negative,
kinase-dead mutant CDK7 (D155A) in the cells (Fig. 5B). We
concluded that CDK7 and HOXC10 formed a complex in
breast cancer cells, which became more abundant upon exposure to drugs.
Different sets of proteins are phosphorylated by CDK7 depending on its function in cell division (i.e., CDK1, 2, 4, 6) or in
transcription as a complex with TFIIH (37). We therefore investigated whether binding of HOXC10 to CDK7 altered its substrate
preference. Also, elongating RNA Pol II can be arrested by endogenous and exogenous DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, adducts induced by anticancer drugs, and DSBs.
These transcription-blocking lesions located on the transcribed
strand are primarily repaired by transcription-coupled repair, the
NER pathway (39). XPD helicase is a key member of the human
TFIIH complex that anchors CAK kinase (cyclin H, MAT1, and

shC10 cells (Fig. 5C) and was increased in MCF10A-Ras- C10 cells,
compared with their respective control cells (Fig. 5D). This
ﬁnding suggested that HOXC10 may have a role in anchoring
CAK to XPD, thus maintaining the integrity of the holoenzyme
TFIIH during response to DNA damage. This ﬁnding is also
consistent with reports that in repair-deﬁcient cells, the association of CAK kinase, but not of XPD, to damaged DNA was
reduced (41).
Next, we investigated whether the association of CDK7
with the RNA Pol II is modulated by HOXC10. We found that
the association between CDK7 and RNA Pol II in drug-treated
cells was signiﬁcantly stronger in the presence of HOXC10 in
MCF10A-Ras-C10 (Fig. 5E) and weaker in the absence of
HOXC10 in SUM150-shC10 (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, the kinase
activity of CDK7 on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol
II was signiﬁcantly reduced in SUM159-shC10 cells after DNA
damage (Fig. 5G). MCL1 is an antiapoptotic protein that is
rapidly depleted upon inhibition of RNA Pol II, permitting
measures of its mRNA to serve as a surrogate for CDK7 activity
(42). The lack of CDK7 activity is likely to impede recovery of
the transcriptional machinery, thereby promoting cell death
after DNA damage as was reﬂected by MCL1 expression (Fig.
5H). Conversely, the enhanced interaction between Pol II and
CDK7 in MCF10A-Ras-C10 cells (Fig. 5E) promotes cell survival following DNA damage (Fig. 5I). Consistent with this
data, newly emerging drug-resistant MCF7 sublines in cell
culture showed increases in both MCL1 and HOXC10 mRNA
expression (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Inhibiting CDK7 reverses HOXC10-dependent
chemoresistance
Inhibiting CDK7 is of special interest in cancer therapeutics as
it affects multiple signaling pathways (43). Two known selective
CDK7 inhibitors are BS-181 (44) and SNS-032 (11); the latter is
in phase I studies (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). Combining SNS032 or BS-181 at minimally cytotoxic doses (20%) with
chemotherapy signiﬁcantly improved the response of both
MCF10-Kras-C10 cells (Fig. 6A and B) and SUM159-shC10
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In taxol and epirubicin-resistant MCF7 sublines, Western blot analysis showed that
CDK7 (pThr170) and CTD (pSer5) were activated (Fig. 6C) with
no change in cell-cycle kinases, CDK1 and CDK2. qRT-PCR
analysis showed an increase in both HOXC10 and MCL1
mRNAs (Fig. 6D). Treatment with taxol combined with BS181 restored drug susceptibility of Tax-R-MCF-7 cells, as seen in
colony formation assays (Fig. 6E), and caused cell kill in
parental MCF-7 cells as shown by MTT assays (Fig. 6F). Similarly, BS-181 restored sensitivity of two MDA-MB-231-Tax-R
sublines to taxol (Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D), an effect
not achieved using inhibitors to CDK1/2/9, AZD5438 (45) and
CDK4/6, PD0332991 (Supplementary Fig. S6E and S6F; ref. 46).
These data suggest a speciﬁc role for CDK7 in resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs.
In summary, our data support a model of HOXC10 action
wherein it is intimately involved in multiple steps in the
process of HR-mediated DNA repair following chemotherapy
exposure of breast cancer cells and in the development of drug

A model for HOXC10 action in breast cancer cells. Upon exposure to
chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (IR), DNA damage mediator genes such as
gH2AX/MDC1/53BP1/BRCA1 are activated, triggering DNA DSB repair.
HOXC10 is upregulated following chemotherapy or ionizing radiation in
ER-negative breast cancer. HOXC10, as part of the CAK complex, participates
in the late stages of DNA repair that involves restart of transcription for
recovery and acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis.

resistance in the long term. HOXC10 is an integral component
of the CAK complex, which allows restart of transcription
following DNA damage (Fig. 7).

Discussion
Chemotherapy failure in breast cancer claims at least 80,000
lives each year worldwide. Here, we present evidence that
HOXC10 overexpression is common and functionally important
for onset of resistance to chemotherapy in ER-negative breast
cancer and is also prognostic of poor outcome primarily in
patients treated with chemotherapy.
Upregulation of HOXC10 is likely to be an important cancer
adaptation mechanism. Ectopic expression of HOXC10 leads to
decreased drug susceptibility, while decreasing its levels
enhances the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in both in vitro
and in vivo models of breast cancer. Mechanistically, HOXC10 is
involved in activating different survival pathways, including
driving checkpoint recovery after DNA damage, a key pathway
that allows cancer cells to overcome damage response arrest

(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 47). HOXC10 does not
affect the sensing of DDR but is required at later stages of the
DNA damage repair by NER and HR (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Fig. S4). Cells expressing high levels of HOXC10 repaired DNA
damage more efﬁciently and resumed transcription and growth;
whereas their low-HOXC10–expressing counterparts eventually
committed to apoptosis. Part of this response, we propose, may
be attributed to the observed association of HOXC10 with the
CAK complex.
The CAK complex along with TFIIH can participate in
diverse functions, including transcription, DNA repair (NER),
and cell-cycle regulation. We conﬁrmed that HOXC10 binding to CDK7 enhances its kinase activity toward the CTD
domain of RNAPII after DNA damage. We surmise that
HOXC10 plays a role in bridging the gap between these 2
complexes, enhancing the recovery process after DNA damage. Indeed, treatment of drug-resistant MCF-7 cells with
CDK7 inhibitors restored their susceptibility to chemotherapy
(Fig. 6). The importance of current ﬁndings to breast cancer
therapy stems from the recent attention given to CDK inhibition, including CDK7, in clinical trials either as single
agents or in combination with chemo- or targeted therapies
to overcome resistance (43, 48).
The second survival pathway that is activated by HOXC10 is
shifting the balance between growth and apoptosis to allow
continuous proliferation and survival under adverse conditions. Our data showed that HOXC10 facilitates the transition
from G1 to S phase and progression through the S-phase during
the cell cycle (Fig. 3). As a consequence, cells with high
HOXC10 levels have a growth advantage, especially under
nonideal conditions, and restart their replication to overcome
stressful conditions. At the same time, the increase in NF-kb
activity and the consequent increase in the levels of many
antiapoptotic proteins likely decrease cell sensitivity to many
stressors.
Because of HOXC10 involvement in survival and proliferation
of cancer cells despite exposure to chemotherapy, HOXC10 is an
attractive target to reverse chemotherapeutic resistance in breast
cancer. Future studies could focus on developing direct inhibitors
of HOXC10 or indirect modulators of its function by targeting its
downstream effectors, such as CDK7.
