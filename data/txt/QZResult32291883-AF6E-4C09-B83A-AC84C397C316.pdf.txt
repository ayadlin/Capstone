BACKGROUND: In this randomized phase 2 study, the authors assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous aflibercept at 2 different doses (2 mg=kg or 4 mg=kg) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who developed disease progression after receiving topotecan and=or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. METHODS: Patients were randomized
to receive intravenous aflibercept at a dose of either 2 mg=kg or 4 mg=kg every 2 weeks until they developed disease progression or
significant toxicity. The primary endpoint was to evaluate Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor response rates (overall
response rate [ORR] 5 complete responses plus partial responses) and to test the null hypothesis (ORR, >5%). Secondary endpoints
included time to tumor progression, safety, progression-free survival=overall survival, drug pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. In
total, 67 evaluable patients per cohort were planned based on a Simon 2-stage design, and, if those patients responded, then enrollment could extend to 200 patients. Tumor radiographic response was assessed by investigators and by an independent review committee. RESULTS: After the first 84 evaluable patients, 8 unconfirmed partial responders were noted (ORR, 10%) across both arms;
the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing blinded accrual. At study completion, 215 evaluable
patients were accrued, including 1 responder of 106 patients (0.9%) in the 2-mg=kg cohort and 5 responders of 109 patients
(4.6%) in the 4-mg=kg cohort according to the independent review committee. The clinical benefit rate (ORR plus stable disease
>6 months) was 12.3% and 11% in the 2-mg=kg and 4-mg=kg cohorts, respectively. Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse
events included hypertension (25.5% and 27.5% in the 2-mg=kg and 4-mg=kg cohorts, respectively), proteinuria (9.4% and 7.3%,
respectively), and fatigue (5.7% and 3.7%, respectively). The gastrointestinal perforation rate was low (3 patients; 1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Aflibercept at a dose of either 2 mg=kg or 4 mg=kg was generally well tolerated but did not meet the primary endpoint for

INTRODUCTION
The primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) consists of tumor debulking followed by
platinum=taxane-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately,
most women develop recurrent disease that is increasingly
resistant to chemotherapy.1 Disease that relapses 6
months after the completion of platinum therapy is considered platinum-resistant. Effective treatments are limited in this setting, although novel targeted therapies are
rapidly emerging.
A potent mediator of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the proliferation, survival, and migration of endothelial cells and
induces microvascular permeability.2 VEGF is overexpressed in EOC.3–5 VEGF blockade and tumor response
have been demonstrated with the humanized anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab when used concurrently with first-line chemotherapy and continued as a
maintenance therapy6,7 and when used as monotherapy
with or without chemotherapy in recurrent, platinumsensitive, and platinum-resistant EOC.8–12
Aflibercept (VEGF Trap, ZALTRAP, zivaflibercept; Sanofi US, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ) is a
recombinant fusion protein composed of VEGFbinding portions from the extracellular domains of
human VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2
fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1.13 This construct
gives aflibercept broad affinity for all ligands that bind to
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, including all isoforms of
VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor.13,14 In
August 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved ziv-aflibercept injection (4 mg=kg) for
use in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were resistant to an oxaliplatincontaining regimen.15 In the phase 1 study of intravenous aflibercept monotherapy (dose range, 0.3-7 mg=kg
every 2 weeks), aflibercept produced evidence of a radiographic partial response (PR) in 3 women who had
recurrent ovarian cancer.16 Three phase 2 studies
exploring intravenous aflibercept in women with
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer have been reported—
single-agent aflibercept (4 mg=kg) effectively controlled
malignant ascites,17,18 and aflibercept (6 mg=kg) plus
docetaxel produced significant antitumor activity (objective response rate [ORR], 54%).19 For the current study,
2-mg=kg and 4-mg=kg dose cohorts were chosen based
on an excess of free aflibercept and steady-state concentrations of bound aflibercept at these dose levels, which
correlated with antitumor efficacy in animal xenograft
models.
336

This randomized phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous aflibercept as a single agent at 2 doses levels (2 mg=kg and 4 mg=kg) every
2 weeks in patients with platinum-resistant, advanced
ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who progressed
on topotecan and=or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as
NCT00327171 (available at: http:==www.clinicaltrials.gov=
ct2=show=NCT00327171; accessed October 1, 2013).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

Key inclusion criteria were age 18 years; histologically
confirmed ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma, including
fallopian tube and primary peritoneal EOC; 2 prior
treatment regimens for recurrent disease; platinumresistant disease (progression during or 6 months after
receiving platinum therapy); topotecan-resistant and=or
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-resistant disease (progression during=after this chemotherapy); evidence of at
least 1 unidimensionally measurable tumor on computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST)20 that was not treated with surgery or
radiation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 2; and adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function. Exclusion criteria included
treatment with >3 chemotherapy regimens for recurrent
disease, prior treatment with a VEGF=VEGFR inhibitor,
and uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure [BP]
>150=100 mm Hg or systolic BP >180 mm Hg if diastolic BP was <90 mm Hg).
All participants provided written informed consent.
The study was approved by the local ethics committees
and was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Study Design and Objectives

This was an international, multicenter, double-blind,
parallel-arm, phase 2 study with a Simon 2-stage design.
Eligible patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive
either aflibercept 2 mg=kg or aflibercept 4 mg=kg as an
intravenous infusion over 1 hour every 2 weeks until they
developed disease progression or significant toxicity.
Patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment
dose assignment. A cycle was defined as 4 weeks
(2 treatments).
Aflibercept delays of up to 2 weeks were allowed for
unresolved toxicity. New cycles of aflibercept were permitted if a study drug-related toxicity had resolved. Doses

and schedules were modified for hypertension, proteinuria, or any serious drug-related toxicity that resulted in a
>2-week treatment delay. Dose reductions were as follows: for the 4-mg=kg cohort, dose level 0 was 4 mg=kg,
dose level 1 was 2 mg=kg, and dose level 2 was 1 mg=kg;
for the 2-mg=kg cohort, dose level 0 was 2 mg=kg, dose
level 1 was 1 mg=kg, and dose level 2 was 0.5 mg=kg. For
grade 2 hypertension, antihypertensive treatment was
initiated; for grade 3 hypertension, treatment was delayed
until BP was 150=90 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced
by 1 level; and, for grade 4 hypertension, cardiology was
consulted, and the patient was removed from the study.
For grade 2 proteinuria, no modification was initiated;
for grade 3 proteinuria, treatment was delayed until urine
protein was <2 g=24 hours, and the dose was reduced by
1 level; and, for grade 4 proteinuria, nephrology was consulted, and the patient was removed from the study. If
patients had greater than 2 dose reductions, then they
were removed from the study.
The primary efficacy variable was the ORR, defined
as complete responses (CR) and PRs according to
RECIST version 1.0.20 Chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT
scans or MRIs were performed at baseline, at the end of
every other even-numbered cycle (ie, cycles 2, 6, 10, 14,
etc), if the patient had symptomatic disease progression,
and at the end of treatment. Investigator response assessments were recorded, and a repeat scan was required to
confirm a PR or CR (4-6 weeks after the initial documentation of response). Tumor response assessments and duration of response were reviewed by an independent
review committee (IRC).
Secondary efficacy variables included the clinical
benefit rate (defined as the proportion of patients who
had stable disease [SD] or a response that lasted 6
months), response duration, progression-free survival,
overall survival, the CA 125 response rate (defined according to modified Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria),21 the time to CA 125 progression, and safety. The
impact on health-related quality of life was reported using
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian
(FACT-O) questionnaire (version 4.0), which was performed at baseline, every other cycle (every 8 weeks), and
at the end of treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) were assessed regularly and were graded
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Routine physical examinations, hematology, biochemistry,
and urine analyses were performed. Laboratory abnormalities and clinical adverse events were assessed according to
the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). To screen for

immunogenicity after exposure, antiaflibercept antibodies
were measured every 8 weeks using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis population was the efficacyevaluable population, defined as all randomized patients
who underwent a baseline radiology assessment and
received at least part of 1 dose of aflibercept. Patients were
randomized to each dose cohort, and no variables were
used for stratification. For the analysis of each dose cohort
to determine whether the ORR was >5% (historic control
rate), a Simon minimax 2-stage design22 was used to test
the null hypothesis that the “true” ORR was 5% versus
the alternative hypothesis that the “true” ORR was
15%. Each cohort sample size was 67 evaluable patients,
assuming a type I error not greater than 2.5% and a type
II error not greater than 20% (80% power at a significance
level of 2.5%). If 8 responders (CR or PR) were observed
among the 67 evaluable patients per treatment group,
then the null hypothesis of an ORR of 5% would be
rejected at a 1-sided 2.5% a level for that treatment
group.
The first-stage analysis was considered an interim
analysis for futility and was performed after the first 42
patients enrolled per arm in stage 1 were classified as
“responders” or “nonresponders” by study site investigators (an IRC review was not required for stage 1). Within
a treatment arm, if 3 or more responders were observed in
stage 1, then an additional 25 efficacy-evaluable patients
were to be enrolled in stage 2. If 2 responders were
observed at the end of stage 1, then the enrollment in that
treatment arm was to be terminated. On the basis of the
recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring
Committee (IDMC) at the planned interim futility (first
stage) analysis in April 2007, the study could continue to
accrue patients beyond 67 patients per group as allowed
in the study design. The IDMC consisted of 3 independent members (2 physicians and 1 biostatistician) who
were not employees of the sponsor and were not associated with conducting the study. The intended maximum
sample size was approximately 200 patients. An approximate maximum of 146 patients (73 patients per treatment
arm) would be needed to assess ORR. In case antitumor
activity was observed in at least 1 treatment arm, an additional 60 patients could be enrolled to gain experience
with 1 or more potentially effective doses.
Confirmed responses were summarized along with
corresponding 95% exact confidence intervals. The IRCconfirmed response was used for the primary endpoint of

ORR. Investigator response evaluations were considered
secondary. The intention-to-treat population included all
randomized patients and was used in the analysis of primary=selected secondary variables and baseline demographics. The safety population included all patients who
received at least part of 1 dose of aflibercept. On the basis
of an FDA recommendation (unmet medical needs), a
subgroup efficacy analysis was performed in patients with
platinum-resistance who progressed after receiving liposomal-doxorubicin.
The survival curves and the median progression-free
and overall survival for each treatment arm were estimated
and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The proportional hazards model was applied to provide the hazard ratio between the 2 cohorts and the corresponding 95%
confidence interval. The log-rank test was used to explore
differences between the 2 cohorts.
RESULTS
After the protocol-planned interim analysis (first stage) and
based on the protocol, the sponsor and the IDMC decided
to enroll up to 200 evaluable patients. One hundred nine
patients in each dose group were randomized, with 106
evaluable patients identified in the 2-mg=kg dose group and
109 evaluable patients identified in the 4-mg=kg group. In
total, 218 patients were randomized in 48 centers between
May 2006 and July 2007 and were included in the
intention-to-treat population; 3 patients (2 mg=kg) did not
receive aflibercept and were not included in either the
efficacy-evaluable population or the safety population
338

(Fig. 1). The majority of patients were withdrawn because of
disease progression (58.5% of patients in the 2-mg=kg group
and 60.6% of patients in the 4-mg=kg group), and only 14
patients were receiving treatment at the time of analysis.
Patient characteristics at baseline were similar between the
groups (Table 1). Most patients had primary ovarian cancer
with serous and poorly differentiated histology. Patients were
heavily pretreated—>50% had received 3 agents for recurrent disease. The median duration of exposure to aflibercept
was 13.4 weeks (range, 1-33 weeks) in the 2-mg=kg group
and 12.1 weeks (range, 1-31 weeks) in the 4-mg=kg group.
Approximately 10% of patients had aflibercept dose reductions, and 25% had 1 cycle delayed by at least 3 days.
Efficacy Evaluations

On the basis of the IRC assessment among the first 67
evaluable patients, there were 0 responders in the
2-mg=kg group and 3 responders (4.5%) in the 4-mg=kg
group. Thus, the study did not meet its primary endpoint
(Table 2). On the basis of investigator-reported data, there
were 3 responders (4.5%) and 7 responders (10.4%) in
the 2-mg=kg and 4-mg=kg groups, respectively.
For the overall efficacy-evaluable population (106
patients in the 2-mg=kg group and 109 patients in the 4mg=kg group), the IRC reported 1 responder (0.9%) in
the 2-mg=kg group and 5 responders (4.6%) in the 4mg=kg group. The IRC-adjudicated clinical benefit rate
was 12.3% for the 2-mg=kg group and 11% for the 4mg=kg group; and 5.7% and 0.9% of patients, respectively, sustained SD=PR for >360 days. Similar results

were observed in the subgroup of patients with unmet
medical needs (60 patients in the 2-mg=kg group and 64
patients in the 4-mg=kg group): the ORR was 1.7% and
6.3% in the 2-mg=kg and 4-mg=kg groups, respectively;
and the clinical benefit rate was 13.3% and 15.6%,
respectively.
The median response duration (determined by the
IRC) was 164 days (1 responder in the 2-mg=kg group)
and 176 days (range, 49-232 days; 5 responders in the 4mg=kg group) (Table 3). The median progression-free
survival was 13.0 weeks and 13.3 weeks in the 2-mg=kg
and 4-mg=kg groups, respectively; and the median survival was 59.0 weeks and 49.3 weeks, respectively (Table
3, Fig. 2). The tumor marker (CA 125) response rate also
was similar between the groups (11.5% in the 2-mg=kg
group and 11.6% in the 4-mg=kg group).
TEAEs related to study treatment were experienced by
91.5% of patients in the 2-mg=kg group and by 89% of
patients in the 4-mg=kg group. The most frequent TEAEs
were hypertension, headache, dysphonia, fatigue, and
proteinuria (Table 4). Forty-seven patients were withdrawn because of a TEAE. Gastrointestinal disorders were
the most common reason for treatment discontinuation,
including 3 serious events of intestinal perforation that
required surgical intervention. All patients recovered. Proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome (8 patients), thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (1 patient), hypertension (2
patients), and pulmonary embolism (2 patients) were
other causes for discontinuation.
There were 50 deaths in the 2-mg=kg group and 58
deaths in the 4-mg=kg group, mostly attributable to progressive disease. Two deaths were possibly related to study
treatment. One patient had grade 4 gastrointestinal necrosis, grade 4 renal failure, septic shock, and respiratory failure; she died on day 92. One patient had grade 3
dizziness, dysphonia, and epistaxis and grade 4 vertigo on
day 151; after drug discontinuation, she fell and suffered
thoracic trauma on day 154, and she died on day 171. A
positive antiaflibercept antibody response was detected in
5 patients, all with low titers that did not correlate with an
adverse event report of hypersensitivity reaction.
Quality-of-Life Assessments

At baseline, the FACT-O total score was 105.3 in the
2-mg=kg group and 101.1 in the 4-mg=kg group. On day
14 of cycle 2, there was a slight but not clinically relevant
decrease in the FACT-O score of 1.1 in the 2-mg=kg
group and 2.8 in the 4-mg=kg group.

DISCUSSION
In this international, randomized phase 2 study of women
with heavily pretreated, platinum-resistant EOC, on IRC
review, intravenous aflibercept (2 mg=kg or 4 mg=kg) did
not meet the primary endpoint of a radiographic response
with an ORR <5% in either dose cohort. An IRCdetermined clinical benefit (SD 1 PR 1 CR) was
observed (2-mg=kg group, 65%; 4-mg=kg group, 70%),
and a small portion of women remained on aflibercept for
>6 months (12.3% and 8.3%, respectively). The safety
profile of aflibercept was similar to that of other angiogenesis inhibitors, and the gastrointestinal perforation rate
was low (1.4%). Response, toxicity, and survival were
similar in both dose cohorts. To our knowledge, this study
is the largest reported trial of an angiogenesis inhibitor in
women with platinum-resistant, recurrent EOC.
Intravenous aflibercept as a single agent does not
have significant activity to recommend further investigation in this patient population. Future studies could be
considered in combination with chemotherapy. A recent
phase 2 study (n 5 46) suggested that higher doses of aflibercept (6 mg=kg) in combination with docetaxel (75
mg=kg) every 3 weeks had marked activity (ORR, 54%)
in women with recurrent EOC.19 In that study, the median progression-free survival was 6.2 months, and the
median overall survival was 24.3 months. However, those
patients had received 1 previous chemotherapy regimen
for recurrent disease, and 28% had platinum-sensitive disease—2 important factors that make a higher response
rate and lower toxicity more likely compared with our
study. Nonetheless, aflibercept combined with
342

chemotherapy appears to be most promising; and, in a
population of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,
aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI chemotherapy led to
a survival advantage and FDA approval.15 Finally, 2 recent
studies suggested that intravenous aflibercept (4 mg=kg)
may offer palliative benefit to reduce symptomatic malignant ascites in women with advanced ovarian cancer.17,18
However, the drug costs and potential side effects make
this strategy less appealing.
Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting
VEGF-A, has demonstrated activity (ORR, 16%-24%) in
3 phase 2 studies among women with recurrent,
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.8,9,11 Two of those
studies allowed the inclusion of patients with platinumsensitive disease.8,11 The third study, which most closely
resembled our patient population, was restricted
to women with platinum-resistant=refractory disease
who had received 2 or 3 prior regimens.9 Although bevacizumab was active in that study (ORR, 16%), a higher
than expected incidence of gastrointestinal perforation (5
of 44 patients; 11.4%) led to its early closure. Given the
differences in sample size (44 patients vs 215 patients) and
geographic treatment locations (selected US academic
centers vs multicenter international sites), it is difficult to
accurately compare that bevacizumab study with our current results.
In conclusion, aflibercept at doses of 2 mg=kg and
4 mg=kg was generally well tolerated in patients with
platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer, but the
primary efficacy endpoint was not reached. More extensive investigation of aflibercept monotherapy is not

warranted in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer;
however, the combination of aflibercept plus docetaxel
has demonstrated promising efficacy, and the combination of aflibercept with standard chemotherapy merits
further clinical development, particularly in those patients
with heavily pretreated disease.
