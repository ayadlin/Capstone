Abstract
Most patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed late in progression and often experience tumor recurrence
and relapses due to drug resistance. Surface expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-14 on ovarian cancer
cells stimulates a tumor–stromal signaling pathway that promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth. In a cohort of
92 patients, we found that MMP-14 was increased in the serum of women with malignant ovarian tumors.
Therefore, we investigated the preclinical efﬁcacy of a MMP-14 monoclonal antibody that could inhibit the
migratory and invasive properties of aggressive ovarian cancer cells in vitro. MMP-14 antibody disrupted ovarian
tumor–stromal communication and was equivalent to Avastin in suppressing blood vessel growth in mice
harboring Matrigel plugs. These effects on angiogenesis correlated with downregulation of several important
angiogenic factors. Furthermore, mice with ovarian cancer tumors treated with anti–MMP-14 monotherapy
showed a marked and sustained regression in tumor growth with decreased angiogenesis compared with
immunoglobulin G (IgG)-treated controls. In a model of advanced peritoneal ovarian cancer, MMP-14–dependent
invasion and metastasis was effectively inhibited by intraperitoneal administration of monoclonal MMP-14
antibody. Together, these studies provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for MMP-14 targeting as an adjuvant
treatment strategy for advanced ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2457–67. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer remains the ﬁfth leading cause of death in
women and the most fatal gynecologic cancer, accounting for
more than 15,000 deaths in the United States annually (1). The
vast majority of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed in
late stages and experience recurrences and relapses due to
drug resistance despite initial response to surgical debulking
and standard ﬁrst-line chemotherapy (2). In addition, there are
no established and effective treatments of platinum refractory
ovarian cancer. Therefore, identiﬁcation of novel targeted
therapies that block critical signaling pathways are important
for improving survival in ovarian cancer (3).

Angiogenic and inﬂammatory markers such as interleukin
(IL)-8, IL-6, growth-related oncogene (GRO)-a, monocyte
chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, VEGF, and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-1 are highly upregulated in epithelial
ovarian cancers (4–7). These markers are postulated to play
a pivotal role in tumor growth, inﬂammation, angiogenesis,
and metastasis and are associated with poor survival (8, 9).
Angiogenesis inhibitors, as exempliﬁed by the VEGF-antibody Avastin, have recently emerged as potential treatments
of recurrent ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer (10). But,
anti-VEGF therapy has not improved overall survival (11)
and one of the reasons is that decreased tumor size has been
associated with increased invasiveness and propensity to
metastasize (12).
MMPs are zinc-dependant endopeptidases that play a key
role in cancer cell invasion, metastases, and tumor angiogenesis (13, 14). Abundant evidence has indicted MMPs
including MMP-1, -2, -9, and -14 as critical mediators of
invasion, blood vessel penetration, and metastasis of many
solid tumors including ovarian cancer (4, 13, 15–18). MMP14, (MT1-MMP), is a transmembrane collagenase, which is
not detected in normal ovarian surface epithelium but is
widely expressed on ovarian carcinomas of all histologic
types (18). High expression of epithelial MMP-14 by immunohistochemistry is associated with poorer prognosis and
shorter disease survival in patients with ovarian cancer (19).
MMP-14 is critical to the acquisition of the invasive (20) and
metastatic phenotype of breast, prostate, melanoma, renal,

and ovarian carcinomas (21–23). MMP-14 promotes a collagen-invasive phenotype (24) in ovarian carcinoma, which
triggers peritoneal dissemination of metastatic ovarian
tumors (23). MMP-14 is known to activate gelatinase
MMP-2 (25) that has been implicated in the mesothelial
attachment and metastatic spread of ovarian cancer cells
(20, 26). We have recently shown that ovarian cancer cell
MMP-14 leads to activation of proMMP-1 (4) via MMP-9,
which culminates in chemokine production, angiogenesis
(4, 16, 27), and ovarian tumor growth (4, 27). Endothelial cell
MMP-14 has been implicated in angiogenesis (28), however,
the mechanism of cancer cell produced MMP-14 in stimulating angiogenesis in the ovarian tumor microenvironment
is unknown.
A causal relationship between MMP expression and cancer
progression led to the evaluation of MMP inhibitors in several
large clinical trials but met with limited efﬁcacy and treatment
failure (29, 30). These small-molecule MMP inhibitors elicited
debilitating musculoskeletal toxicities that precluded adequate dosing and poor patient compliance (31, 32). Toxicity
was assumed to be due to the broad-spectrum nature of these
compounds, which led to off-target inhibition of protective
MMPs such as MMP-8 and -12 leading to worse clinical outcomes (29). Moreover, most of the patients recruited to the
trials were in late stages (stage III–IV) of cancer, which could
potentially miss the positive therapeutic beneﬁts of blocking
MMP pathway at earlier stages in cancer (33).
In this study, we used a monoclonal antibody to inhibit
MMP-14 on the ovarian carcinoma cells. MMP-14 inhibition
led to suppression of both migratory and invasive propensity
of ovarian carcinoma cells. MMP-14 antibody suppressed
ovarian cancer cell-stimulated angiogenesis in vitro and in
mice. Further, MMP-14 antibody treatment led to a marked
regression in ovarian tumor growth and tumor blood vessel
formation in a mouse xenograft model indicating that MMP-14
may be an attractive target for antiangiogenic therapy in
ovarian cancer and perhaps other solid tumors. Furthermore,
in a peritoneal model of aggressive ovarian cancer, combination intraperitoneal therapy of MMP-14 antibody and docetaxol inhibited invasion through the mouse diaphragm and
thoracic metastasis. We believe, blockade of MMP-14 as monotherapy or as combinatorial therapy along with conventional
chemotherapy has direct clinical relevance for adjuvant and
metronomic treatment regimens in ovarian cancer.

and MMP-9 have been described (4) and were obtained from
Dharmacon.
Cell culture
Ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-4, SKOV-3, and OVCAR-3
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute and were
grown in RPMI with 10% FBS. Cells were serum-starved
overnight in 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for migration
and invasion assays. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were bought from Cambrex (Lonza) and cultured in
EBM2 medium with Bullet kit and 10% FBS. HUVEC cells were
serum-starved for 1 hour before tube formation. Gelatinase
activity was assayed from conditioned media by measuring the
cleavage of ﬂuorescein-conjugated DQ gelatin (Molecular
Probes). Gelatinase assays contained 10 mg DQ gelatin in 50
mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2,
and 0.2 mmol/L NaN3 and cleavage was monitored at 538 nm
using a ﬂuorescence microplate reader with excitation at 485
nm at 37 C. Gelatinase activity was expressed as percentage of
the control group. Experiments were repeated 3 times in
triplicates.
Detection of MMP-14 in patient samples
All patient blood samples were collected in full compliance
with Tufts and Lahey Institutional Review Board guidelines.
Blood was collected from women presenting at Tufts Medical
Center (Boston, MA) or Lahey Clinic (Burlington, MA) with
benign or malignant pelvic masses, before surgery. Blood was
processed to collect serum that was stored at 80 C till further
use. Several serum samples were also obtained from Gynecology Oncology Group Tissue bank. Discarded patient ﬂuids
were collected from patients undergoing a peritoneal and
pulmonary tap at Tufts Medical Center. Serum samples were
diluted 10-fold and MMP-14 levels were quantiﬁed using ELISA
(USCN E92056Hu). Groups were compared with one-way
ANOVA followed by t test.  , P < 0.05. Patient ﬂuids and serum
samples were normalized using Bradford assay. Two microliter
of normalized samples (2.2 mg/mL) were mixed with citrate
buffer, EDTA, and 5 sample buffer in a 10 mL volume, heated
for 40 minutes at 37 C, and immunoblotted with monoclonal
MMP-14 antibody (Ab; MAB 918).

Materials and Methods

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was conducted as described before (4)
using a mouse monoclonal antibody speciﬁc to MMP-14
(R&D Systems MAB9181).

Reagents
MMP-14 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences), R&D (MAB 9181, 918), and Millipore (MAB 3319). Isotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) control
was purchased from R&D System and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated rabbit anti-mouse from Invitrogen.
MMP-7 (Ab-2), MMP-8 (Ab-1), and TIMP-1 (Ab-1) mouse
monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Oncogene. Human
MMP-14 ELISA was obtained from USCN (E92056Hu; Uscn Life
Science, Inc.) and human Quantikine MMP-9 and VEGF ELISA
from R&D Systems and used as per manufacturer's protocol.
RNA interference reagents (RNAi) against Luciferase, MMP-14,

Migration and invasion
Chemotactic migration and invasion was conducted using
an 8 mm Transwell apparatus (Corning), as described previously (16). Of note, 50,000 serum-starved ovarian cancer cells
were treated with 10 mg/mL of antibody and placed in the top
chamber of the Transwell in 200 mL of 0.25% BSA in RPMI. The
cells were migrated toward stromal matrix (ﬁbroblast conditioned media) or malignant ovarian ascites, as previously
described (16) for a period of 5 hours. For chemoinvasion,
wells were coated with of 20 mg of reconstituted matrix
(Matrigel; BD Biosciences; ref. 4) and cells were migrated

similarly for 20 hours. For collagen invasion assays, Transwell
were coated with 30 mg of rat tail high concentration type I
collagen (BD Biosciences) and cells were migrated for 40 hours.
Migrated and invaded cells on the lower surface of the Transwell were ﬁxed, stained, and counted and data were compared

injections of 2.5 mg/kg of either IgG or MMP-14 antibody
twice a week with concomitant docetaxel (5 mg/kg at day 21).
At the end of 35 days, tumors and organs were excised from
euthanized mice, ﬁxed in 10% formalin/PBS, and imbedded in
parafﬁn. Tissue sections (5 mm) from omentum, diaphragm,
and thoracic organs were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined in a blinded manner by 2
pathologists.

Tube formation assay
MatTek plates were chilled to 4 C and coated with 100 mL
of Matrigel per well. Freshly passaged HUVEC cells (35,000;
P2-5) in EBM2 media with 0.25% BSA were plated on
Matrigel-coated MatTek plates and stimulated with conditioned media from OVCAR-4 or SKOV-3 cells treated with
either MMP-14 antibody, IgG or RNAi. Endothelial tube
formation was observed after 18 hours and photographed
under phase contrast microscopy using an inverted Olympus
microscope. Digital images were used to count total tubes
per 5 40 ﬁelds and quantiﬁed for tube length and branching complexity using NIH ImageJ software. Measures were
expressed in number of branch points and actual tubal
length.  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.005.

Results

RNA interference
Cells were transfected with Luci, MMP-14, or MMP-9
RNAi using oligofectamine as previously described (4). Thirty
hours after recovery, the cells were either used for RNA
preparation or serum-starved for conditioned media.
Matrigel plugs and ovarian cancer xenograft models
All animal experiments were carried out in full compliance
with Tufts Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Female NCR Nu/Nu mice (5–7 weeks) were purchased from Taconic farms. Mice were injected with 300 mL
Matrigel plugs of equal parts conditioned media and Matrigel
in their ﬂanks subcutaneously. Animals were subsequently
treated 24 hours later with either MMP-14 antibody, IgG, or
Avastin (2.5 mg/kg twice weekly) in a 100 mL volume. At the end
of 7 days, mice were euthanized and plugs were excised and
ﬁxed in 10% formalin/PBS and stained with CD31 (Chemicon,
MAB 1398Z) for confocal microscopy, as previously described
(27). For ovarian xenograft experiments, mice were injected
subcutaneously with 3.5 million OVCAR-4 cells in their ﬂanks.
Mice were randomized into 2 treatment groups and 24 hours
later injected with 2.5 mg/kg of IgG or MMP-14 antibody,
intraperitoneally (i.p.), twice weekly till day 26. Tumor sizes
were measured twice weekly initially and every other day after
day 26 for the duration of the experiment. Tumor volume was
calculated using the formula: V ¼ length  diameter2/2. Mice
were euthanized on day 35 and tumors and tissues were
collected. Tumors were stained for endothelial marker CD31
(760-4378; Ventana Medical Systems, automated as per manufacturer's protocol) and evaluated by a pathologist in a
blinded manner.
For the Peritoneal Ovarian Tumor Model, mice were injected
into the peritoneal cavity with 1.5 million OVCAR-4 cells.
Animals were treated 24 hours later with intraperitoneal

Serum MMP-14 is increased in patients with invasive
ovarian cancer
We have previously shown that MMP-14 initiates the activation of a MMP cascade in the ovarian tumor microenvironment that leads to angiogenesis and ovarian tumor growth (4).
High expression of epithelial MMP-14 by immunohistochemistry was associated with poor outcome in patients with
ovarian cancer (19). Therefore, we investigated whether
MMP-14 could be detected as a tumor biomarker in the serum
and malignant ascites of patients with ovarian carcinoma.
These patients are known to produce copious amounts of
peritoneal ascites and we explored whether we could detect
MMP-14 or a cleaved part of MMP-14 in malignant ovarian
ascites. We collected ﬂuids from 14 patients with malignant
and benign disease (malignant ovarian ascites, n ¼ 5; malignant ovarian cyst, n ¼ 1; malignant pleural effusions from
patients with ovarian cancer, n ¼ 4; benign ascites, n ¼ 3; and
benign ovarian cyst, n ¼ 1) and found that the levels of MMP-14
were more than 3-fold increased in the malignant ﬂuids of
patients with ovarian cancer compared with benign ﬂuids (Fig.
1A). Because MMP-14 was increased in the malignant ovarian
ascites, we further explored whether it could be detected in the
serum of patients with malignant ovarian cancer. In a cohort of
92 patients comprising healthy females (n ¼ 34), those with
benign ovarian tumors (n ¼ 32) and malignant ovarian cancer
(serous epithelial cancer, stages II–IV; n ¼ 26), we found that
serum MMP-14 was signiﬁcantly increased in patients with
malignant ovarian carcinoma (Fig. 1A). To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report of increased MMP-14 in the serum and
malignant ascites of patients with ovarian carcinoma and
has important implications not only as a biomarker of the
disease but also as a tumor marker for monitoring response
to therapy. We also conﬁrmed the presence of MMP-14 in
these samples of malignant ovarian ascites, malignant pleural effusion, and the serum of patients with ovarian carcinoma using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B and C). Immunoblotting for MMP-14 showed several fragments of MMP-14
exodomain as previously described (34). Our data correlate
with the increased expression of MMP-14 found by immunohistochemistry in metastatic ovarian lesions as compared
with primary ovarian tumors (23) and suggests an important
role for MMP-14 in ovarian cancer progression. We also
tested aggressive OVCAR-4, SKOV-3, or OVCAR-3 ovarian
cancer cells and found a robust expression of MMP-14 by
ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1D). This ﬁnding reiterates the fact that
MMP-14 can be detected as a tumor biomarker in malignant
ovarian cancer and emphasizes the importance of this MMP
in ovarian carcinogenesis.

Monoclonal MMP-14 antibody inhibits migration and
invasion of ovarian cancer cells
MMP-14, when overexpressed, promotes cancer cell migration and invasion (24, 35) critical to the acquisition of the
metastatic phenotype in ovarian cancer (23). MMP-14 silencing suppresses migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro
(36) and pharmacologic inhibition of MMPs, including MMP14, using broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors such as prinimostat
inhibits tumor progression (37). However, as broad-spectrum
MMP inhibitors have not been successful in clinical trials (38),
we investigated whether selective blockade of MMP-14 using a
monoclonal antibody could inhibit the migratory ability of
ovarian carcinoma cells. We treated OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-3
cells with monoclonal MMP-14 antibody or corresponding IgG
and allowed them to migrate toward ﬁbroblast conditioned
media (Fig. 2A) or malignant ovarian ascites (Fig. 2B). Treatment with MMP-14 antibody signiﬁcantly decreased migration
by 46% to 69% of OVCAR-3 (P < 0.05) and OVCAR-4 (P < 0.005)

cancer cells, respectively, compared with IgG controls (Fig. 2A).
We also used several other relevant monoclonal antibodies as
controls. MMP-7 is a matrilysin important for inducing ovarian
cancer invasion (39), MMP-8 is tumor collagenase such as
MMP-14, which is known to play a protective role in cancers
(40) but is not expressed in our ovarian cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) inhibits most MMPs except membrane-tethered
MMPs such as MMP-14, -16, and -25 (41). Unlike MMP-14
antibody, antibodies against MMP-7, -8, and TIMP-1 did not
suppress migration of either cell line (Fig. 2A), suggesting that
the migratory ability of ovarian cancer cells was dependent
on MMP-14. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently being used as
ﬁrst-line therapy in ovarian cancer (10) along with standard
chemotherapeutic regimens but has not yet improved
overall survival perhaps due to increased local invasion and
metastasis (12). We therefore tested whether antibodies
against VEGF (Avastin) would inhibit migration of ovarian

cancer cells. Anti-VEGF antibody had no effect on the migration of OVCAR-4 cells, whereas they had a nonsigniﬁcant
decrease on the migration of OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 2A).
In the peritoneal cavity, malignant ovarian ascites serves as a
rich chemoattractant for the migratory ovarian carcinoma
cells. To examine the role of MMP-14 in migration toward
ascites, we treated OVCAR-4 or OVCAR-3 cells with MMP-14
RNAi (36) and migrated them toward malignant ovarian
ascites. MMP-14 silencing of OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-3 cells led
to a 60% to 80% decrease in MMP-14 levels at the mRNA level
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) and 80% to 95% decrease by ﬂow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D, respectively),
which was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig.
S1E and S1F). MMP-14 RNAi-treated OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-3
cells showed decreased migration toward ascites compared
with the corresponding luciferase-treated cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with the MMP-14 antibody data, suggesting that MMP14 is important for the movement of ovarian cancer cells in the
peritoneal cavity.
We further explored the effect of MMP-14 antibody on
ovarian cancer cell invasion. MMP-14 antibody-treated cells
showed a more than 50% reduction in the invasion of OVCAR-4
and a 40% reduction in the invasion of OVCAR-3 cells through
reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) compared with
corresponding IgG controls. Antibodies against VEGF (Avastin), MMP-7, and TIMP-1 had no signiﬁcant effect on Matrigel
invasion (Fig. 2C). We also tested invasion through reconsti-

tuted type I collagen matrices, which is highly dependent on
MMP-14 activity (42). We migrated MMP-14 antibody-treated
OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-3 cells through a type I collagen matrix
and found that MMP-14 antibody signiﬁcantly inhibited more
than 60% of the invasive propensity of OVCAR-4 (P < 0.005) and
OVCAR-3 cells compared with respective IgG-treated controls
(P < 0.05; Fig. 2D). These data suggest that selectively blocking
MMP-14 may be physiologically relevant for inhibiting the
migratory and invasive potential of ovarian carcinoma cells.
Blockade of cancer cell MMP-14 inhibits endothelial
angiogenesis
Endothelial cell MMP-14 is known to be important for blood
vessel formation (43) because MMP-14 knockout mice display
skeletal defects due to impaired vascularization of the cartilage
and endothelial cells from these mice show decreased ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF2)-induced capillary tube formation
(44). We postulated that the cancer cell MMP-14 was regulating
the release of angiogenic factors in the ovarian tumor microenvironment and stimulating blood vessel formation. To test
the role of cancer cell MMP-14 in cancer cell–stimulated
angiogenesis, we treated OVCAR-4 or SKOV-3 cells overnight
with either MMP-14–blocking antibody or IgG (10 mg/mL),
collected serum-starved conditioned media, and stimulated
HUVECs on Matrigel-coated plates. HUVECs stimulated with
conditioned media from MMP-14 antibody-treated OVCAR-4
or SKOV-3 cells showed 60% to 83% reduction in branching

effects were a function of blockade of MMP-14 on the cancer
cell, we also collected serum-starved conditioned media from
MMP-14 and Luci RNAi-treated OVCAR-4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1E) and stimulated tube formation. MMP-14
gene silencing of the ovarian cancer cells completely blocked
carcinoma cell–stimulated angiogenesis (Fig. 3C) conﬁrming
that endothelial tube formation was at least partly regulated
through cancer cell MMP-14. We conducted a mitochondrial
activity assay (MTT) to rule out that MMP-14 antibody treatment affected the viability of treated cells. MMP-14 antibodyand IgG-treated endothelial and cancer cells did not show any
differences in viability after 72 hours of treatment (Fig. 3D).
This suggests that the cancer cell MMP-14 was regulating the
production or release of angiogenic factors in the ovarian

tumor microenvironment that promoted endothelial tube
formation and branching complexity.
Furthermore, we characterized the MMP-14 antibodies used
in this study (Calbiochem and R&D Systems) and found that
they blocked the conversion of proMMP-2 to active MMP-2
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore, MMP-14 antibody
(R&D Systems) was speciﬁc in recognizing MMP-14 protein
and did not cross-react with other MMPs such as MMP-3, -7,
and -8 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Cancer cell MMP-14 regulates angiogenesis in the
ovarian tumor microenvironment
Cancer cell MMP-14 is known to convert proMMP-2 to
MMP-2 (25). We have previously shown that MMP-14 on the
ovarian cancer cells regulates activation of proMMP-1 to
MMP-1, which upregulates chemokine production and ovarian
cancer angiogenesis (4). Therefore, we speculated that cancer

MMP-14 Antibody Inhibits Ovarian Tumor Progression

MMP-14 gene suppression signiﬁcantly reduced gelatin activity (Fig. 4B), part of which can be attributed to MMP-9 activity
as OVCAR-4 cells lack MMP-2 (Supplementary Fig S2A and
S2B).
We further tested whether MMP-14 blockade also had an
effect on VEGF levels. MMP-14 knockdown also signiﬁcantly
decreased VEGF A (165) levels in serum-starved OVCAR-4
conditioned media (Fig. 4C) establishing the importance of
MMP-14 in ovarian tumor angiogenesis. To ensure that these
effects were a function of decreased MMP-9, we also collected
serum-starved conditioned media from OVCAR-4 cells that
had been treated with MMP-9 and Luci RNAi (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Fig. S3A) and stimulated tube formation.
MMP-9 gene silencing of the ovarian cancer cell showed more
than 75% decrease in tubal length and branching complexity
(Fig. 4D). This suggested that at least a part of the MMP-14–
regulated ovarian cancer angiogenesis was mediated through
suppression of MMP-9 (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Fig.

cell MMP-14 was regulating angiogenesis by modulating the
activity of other MMPs or angiogenic factors (45) in the ovarian
tumor microenvironment. Having seen the unequivocal effects
of MMP-14 antibody and MMP-14 RNAi on in vitro cancer cell–
stimulated angiogenesis, we explored the angiogenic factors
being regulated through MMP-14. It is well established that
MMP-9 and VEGF are important for tumor angiogenesis (46),
but it is not well known that MMP-14 regulates MMP-9 (47). We
hypothesized that MMP-14 was suppressing blood vessel
formation by downregulating production or release of
MMP-9 or VEGF, or both of these factors. We tested MMP14 antibody-treated OVCAR-4 cell conditioned media and
conﬁrmed the decrease in MMP-9 levels by ELISA (Fig. 4A).
Because active MMP-9 is required for the release of VEGF from
the cancer cells and for promoting angiogenesis (46), we
further tested whether MMP-14 inhibition decreased MMP-9
activity by measuring in situ gelatinase (largely MMP-2 and -9)
activity from RNAi-treated OVCAR-4 cell conditioned media.

S3B) especially as MMP-14 antibody added directly on the
HUVECs did not signiﬁcantly suppress tube formation (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Having seen the importance of cancer cell MMP-14 in
ovarian cancer angiogenesis and the inhibitory effects of
MMP-14 antibody on in vitro tube formation, we tested whether this would be true for in vivo angiogenesis. We subcutaneously injected Matrigel plugs into the ﬂanks of female nude
mice. The plugs consisted of equal volumes of OVCAR-4
conditioned media and Matrigel along with HUVECs. The
mice were then treated on day 2 with either MMP-14 antibody
or corresponding IgG antibody or Avastin (VEGF) twice a week
at 2.5 mg/kg i.p. At the end of 7 days, Matrigel plugs were
excised, ﬁxed overnight, and stained with CD31, a marker for
endothelial cells (27). Both MMP-14 and VEGF antibody-treated mice showed a marked decrease in vascularization of
Matrigel plugs as compared with the IgG-treated controls (Fig.
4E). The Matrigel plug experiment not only established the
efﬁcacy of the MMP-14 antibody in vivo, but also the adequate
dose required for inhibition of blood vessels suggesting that
blocking MMP-14 may be a therapeutic strategy to inhibit
ovarian cancer angiogenesis.
MMP-14 antibody inhibits ovarian tumor growth and
angiogenesis
Small-molecule MMP inhibitors have not been successful in
clinical trials due to their broad-spectrum effects. As shown
earlier, monoclonal MMP-14 antibody had striking effects on in
vivo ovarian cancer angiogenesis and did not bind nonspecifically to other MMPs such as MMP-8 (Supplementary Fig. S2C);
therefore, we further tested whether these effects could be
translated into decreased tumor growth. We injected 3.5
million OVCAR-4 ovarian carcinoma cells subcutaneously into
the ﬂanks of nude mice. Mice were randomized 24 hours later
into 2 treatment groups and treated with either MMP-14
antibody or corresponding IgG (2.5 mg/kg, twice per week,
i.p.). MMP-14 antibody–treated mice showed a signiﬁcant
reduction in tumor growth (P < 0.05) from day 26 onward
(Fig. 5A). As antibodies usually have long lasting effects, we
stopped treatment in both groups at day 27 and let the tumors
grow for another week. After halting treatment, the IgG-treated
mice had exponential tumor growth, whereas the MMP-14
antibody-treated mice continued to show a signiﬁcant reduction (P < 0.01) in tumor growth compared with the IgG-treated
mice. Furthermore, within the MMP-14 antibody treatment
group there was no signiﬁcant increase in tumor size between
the day 28 and 35 time point showing the long lasting effect of
the MMP-14 antibody treatment on tumor growth. Mice were
euthanized and tumors collected for CD31 immunohistochemistry on day 35. MMP-14-treated mice showed a marked
reduction in blood vessels (P < 0.005) both at the tumor edge
and the tumor center compared with the IgG-treated controls
(Fig. 5B and C). We correlated decreased angiogenesis with
reduced tumor growth in MMP-14 antibody-treated tumors
compared with their IgG-treated counterparts. Furthermore,
we examined the livers of mice in both treatment groups and
found no obvious signs of toxicity (data not shown). These
ﬁndings suggest that MMP-14 is an important regulator of

2464

ovarian cancer angiogenesis and tumor growth and could
potentially be a novel target for antiangiogenic therapy in
ovarian cancer.
Intraperitoneal combination of MMP-14 antibody plus
docetaxol inhibits invasion and metastasis of ovarian
cancer in nude mice
Patients whose cancer has spread throughout the peritoneal
cavity have a poor survival rate, thus inhibition of peritoneal
dissemination and metastatic progression is critical for the
successful treatment of ovarian cancer. Therefore, we assessed
whether inhibition of MMP-14 using a monoclonal antibody in
combination with docetaxel was able to slow progression of
peritoneal ovarian cancer in mice. We have previously developed a histologic staging system that used the diaphragm as a
marker of the progressive invasion and metastasis from the
peritoneal cavity/omentum to the thoracic organs (4). We
injected 1.5 million aggressive OVCAR-4 ovarian cancer cells
into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Starting on day 2, mice
received either IgG or MMP-14 antibody (2.5 mg/kg i.p., twice
a week) and 2 doses of docetaxel (5 mg/kg) i.p. on day 21 and
28 until the end of the experimental period. At the 35-day
time point, all of the IgG-treated mice had complete penetration through the diaphragm and metastasis to the lungs and
mediastinum, conﬁrming that the OVCAR-4 cells were
extremely aggressive and metastatic in vivo (Fig. 5D and
Supplementary Fig. S4A). In comparison, mice treated with
MMP-14 antibody had a marked decrease in metastatic progression (P ¼ 0.01) and the cancer remained conﬁned to the
peritoneal surface of the diaphragm in 75% of the mice (Fig. 5D
and Supplementary Fig S4A). Although we did not see a
signiﬁcant reduction in ascites volume between the two treatment groups, the ascites in the MMP-14–treated mice was
straw colored as opposed to the bloody ascites in the IgGtreated mice (Supplementary Fig. S4B). MMP-14 antibody
conferred signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.01) protection against invasion
into the diaphragm and thoracic metastases suggesting that
MMP-14–targeted therapy maybe clinically relevant for inhibiting progression of advanced ovarian cancer.

Discussion
MMP-14: a new antiangiogenic molecular therapeutic
target in human ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancers critically depend on blood vessels for their
expansive growth and belong to the group of highly angiogenic
tumors that respond to even monotherapy with antiangiogenic
drugs (48). Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against
VEGF, has been increasingly used upfront for therapy in
ovarian cancer (10). Despite early beneﬁts seen with these
anti-VEGF pathway targeting drugs, the clinical beneﬁts in
terms of overall survival have been modest and associated with
enhanced local invasion and metastatic progression (12).
Therefore, it is possible that therapies that target multiple,
distinct angiogenic pathways are superior to those targeting
singular angiogenic pathways. We believe MMP-14 could be
such a target in ovarian cancer.
MMP-14 has been associated with poor overall survival
in breast cancer (22), and in this study, we found MMP-14

to be increased in the serum of patients with malignant
ovarian cancer compared with normal women and those
with benign ovarian masses conﬁrming its importance for
ovarian carcinogeneis. MMP-14 is a 66-kDa membranetethered MMP and unlike other MMPs it is not known to
be secreted into the tumor milieu. However, we postulated
that other MMPs and serine proteases present in the
ovarian tumor microenvironment might cleave the extracellular domain of MMP-14 (49) and allow for its detection
in patient with ovarian cancer ﬂuids and serum. We conﬁrmed the increased presence of cleaved MMP-14 in malignant ovarian ascites, pleural effusions from patients with
ovarian cancer, and serum of these patients using ELISA
and immunoblot analysis using a MMP-14 monoclonal
antibody. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to report
the detection of MMP-14 in the serum and malignant ﬂuids
of patients with ovarian cancer. Detection of MMP-14 in the
serum is important for monitoring relapse and recurrence

of the disease, remission and potentially, response to antiMMP-14–targeted therapy.
Recently, there have been several reports of proinvasive
consequences of antiangiogenic tumor therapy (50) that led
the authors to suggest that a combination of different treatment regimens, which include anti-invasive therapy, may be
more effective in blocking tumor progression. MMP-14, which
is expressed on the invadopodia of cancer cells (20), could be
such a therapeutic target. However targeting MMPs has been
challenging and like other systemic therapy broad-spectrum
MMP inhibitors failed to produce enduring efﬁcacy in terms of
either tumor shrinkage or long-term survival beneﬁt (30, 32). In
this study, we used commercially available monoclonal antibody against MMP-14 to signiﬁcantly impair the migratory and
invasive ability of MMP-14 expressing ovarian cancer cells.
This is especially relevant for the spread of ovarian cancer cells
within the rich milieu of the peritoneal cavity (23). These
results show that antimigratory and anti-invasive property of

the MMP-14 antibody could be a signiﬁcant advantage over the
VEGF antibody for long-term antiangiogenic therapy.
Using a monoclonal antibody or RNAi against ovarian
cancer cell MMP-14, we disrupted tumor–stromal communication that normally stimulated in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis. In vivo, MMP-14 antibody was equivalent to Avastin in
blocking blood vessel growth within Matrigel plugs in mice. We
conﬁrmed that these effects were not due to inhibition of
cellular proliferation but due to production of angiogenic
factors. Cancer cell MMP-14 not only regulated MMP-9 and
VEGF production and but also MMP-9 activity, which is
important for VEGF release (46). Although OVCAR-4 cells do
not express MMP-1, we have previously shown that MMP-14 on
the ovarian cancer cell, along with MMP-9 activates stromal
proMMP-1 to MMP-1 (4), which is known to be important for
tumor angiogenesis (9, 16) directly and through the upregulation of several chemokines (27).
Furthermore, mice bearing OVCAR-4 ovarian cancer tumors
when treated with MMP-14 antibody as monotherapy showed
a marked regression in tumor growth. Even a week after the
treatment had been stopped, there was no signiﬁcant growth in
the MMP-14 antibody-treated tumors, whereas the IgG-treated
cohort continued to grow exponentially. The MMP-14 antibody-treated tumors showed a marked reduction in CD31stained blood vessels compared with the IgG controls providing proof-of-concept for targeting MMP-14 for antiangiogenic
therapy in ovarian cancer. In addition, in an aggressive, orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, MMP-14 antibody along
with docetaxel, inhibited invasion through the diaphragm and
thoracic metastasis. We believe that MMP-14 blockade as
monotherapy or as combinatorial therapy with standard-ofcare drugs may have direct clinical relevance for patients with

advanced ovarian cancer and implications for adjuvant therapeutic regimens not only for ovarian cancer but also for other
solid tumors.
