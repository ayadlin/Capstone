Abstract
The cytokine IL6 has a number of tumor-promoting activities in human and experimental cancers, but its potential as
an angiogenic agent has not been fully investigated. Here, we
show that IL6 can directly induce vessel sprouting in the ex vivo
aortic ring model, as well as endothelial cell proliferation and
migration, with similar potency to VEGF. However, IL6-stimulated aortic ring vessel sprouts had defective pericyte coverage
compared with VEGF-stimulated vessels. The mechanism of
IL6 action on pericytes involved stimulation of the Notch

ligand Jagged1 as well as angiopoietin2 (Ang2). When peritoneal xenografts of ovarian cancer were treated with an antiIL6 antibody, pericyte coverage of vessels was restored. In
addition, in human ovarian cancer biopsies, there was an
association between levels of IL6 mRNA, Jagged1, and Ang2.
Our ﬁndings have implications for the use of cancer therapies
that target VEGF or IL6 and for understanding abnormal
angiogenesis in cancers, chronic inﬂammatory disease, and
stroke. Cancer Res; 75(15); 3098–107. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

and clinical studies, we found that a therapeutic neutralizing antiIL6 antibody reduced systemic VEGF levels in ovarian cancer
patients, and that in peritoneal ovarian cancer xenografts, blood
vessels were reduced, with a concomitant inhibition of the Notch
ligand Jagged 1 (7).
This led us to study further the actions of IL6 in normal and
cancer angiogenesis. In this article, we present novel evidence
that IL6 directly stimulates angiogenesis, but in contrast with
VEGF, IL6-stimulated vessels have defective pericyte coverage.
We show that this may be due to differential regulation of
Notch ligands and Ang2 by these two mediators. Our ﬁndings
have implications for the use of cancer therapies that target
VEGF or IL6.

IL6 is a major tumor-promoting cytokine produced by both
malignant and host cells in the tumor microenvironment (1). It is
also a downstream product of oncogenic mutations, for example,
ras and TP53 (2, 3). Typically via its major downstream signal
transducer STAT3, IL6 has both local and systemic protumor
actions in experimental and human cancers. In the tumor microenvironment, these include stimulation of malignant cell growth
and survival (4), promotion of invasion and metastasis (5),
modulation of tumor-promoting T-cell subtypes, involvement
in autocrine tumor cell cytokine networks (6), and regulation of
the myeloid cell inﬁltrate (7). Systemic effects of excess IL6
production include induction of acute phase reactants and
involvement in the elevated platelet count (paraneoplastic thrombocytosis; ref. 8) that is a complication of several common human
cancers.
To add to this catalogue of tumor-promoting actions, there are
reports that IL6 stimulates angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment (9) with evidence that STAT3 signaling induces hypoxiainducible factor-mediated VEGF-A transcription (10). IL6 is also
reported to have direct effects on endothelial cell proliferation and
migration (9, 11, 12) and has been implicated in resistance to
anti-VEGF antibody treatment in patients (13, 14). In preclinical

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All animal experiments were approved by the local ethics
review process of the Biological Services Unit, Queen Mary University of London (London, United Kingdom) and conducted in
accordance with the UKCCCR guidelines for the welfare and use of
animals in cancer research.
Aortic ring assay
Angiogenic sprouts were induced from mouse or rat thoracic
aortas according to the method of Nicosia and Ottinetti (15).
Aortas were dissected from cervically dislocated 8- to 12-week-old
male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) or 180–200 g male Wistar rats
(Harlan Laboratories) and sliced into 0.5 mm sections and
incubated overnight in serum-free OptiMEM (Invitrogen) at
37 C. Aortic rings were embedded in type I collagen (1 mg/mL)
in E4 media (Invitrogen). For mouse aortic rings, the wells were
supplemented with OptiMEM with 1% FBS and 30 ng/mL of
VEGF (R&D Systems), 50 ng/mL of human IL6 (R&D Systems), or
30 ng/mL of mouse IL6 (R&D Systems) and incubated at 37 C,
10% CO2. Rat aortic ring wells were treated with OptiMEM with
1% FBS and 10 ng/mL VEGF, 10 ng/mL rat IL6, or 10 nmol/L
VEGFRi (Cediranib, VEGFR2 inhibitor) and incubated at 37 C,

10% CO2. Angiogenic sprouts were counted after 7 days of culture
for mouse aortic ring and after 4 days of culture for rat aortic rings.
The length of sprouts was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software by
drawing radial lines from the base of the aortic ring to the tip of the
sprouting new vessel. Pericytes were quantiﬁed 250 microns from
the tip of the aortic ring vessel to avoid false-positive quantiﬁcation of activated ﬁbroblast, which are normally found at the stalk
of the vessel. Animals were housed and treated in accordance with
UK Home Ofﬁce Regulations.
Staining of aortic rings
The rat and mouse aortic rings were, respectively, cultured for 1
and 2 weeks before the staining. The rings were washed with PBS,
ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes. The wells were then
washed once in PBS and the rings were permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes, before being washed twice in
PBS. Of note, 100 mL of BS-1 Lectin FITC (1 mg/mL; Sigma, cat. no.
L9381/L5264; 1:200), anti-actin, a-SMA Cy3 (Sigma, cat. no.
C6198; 1:500), or anti-NG2 (Millipore, ab5320; 1:200) was
added and incubated overnight at 4 C. For IL6Ra staining on
aortic rings, 100 mL of the unconjugated (1:200) IL6Ra antibody
was left overnight at 4 C. The following day the rings were washed
with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody
(Life Technologies, A-11034) for 2 hours at room temperature.
The plates were washed twice in PBS and the rings were removed
from the 96-well plate, using a syringe needle, placed on a
microscope slide, and mounted with Prolong Gold DAPI containing medium (Invitrogen, cat. no. P36931). The slides were left to
dry and imaged using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510
META).
Tissue culture
Mouse lung endothelial cell (MLEC) was kindly given by
Professor Kairbaan Hodivala-Dilke, and was used for most of the
in vitro studies. This cell line was isolated and cultured as described
previously (16). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC; HPA Laboratories) were grown and cultured in endothelial growth medium (HPA Laboratories) and maintained
within 3 to 4 passages.
Ovarian cancer cell lines
The IGROV-1 line was recently characterized as a hypermutated
line but unlikely to represent HGSC. The cell line was mycoplasma tested (InvivoGen) and always maintained within 4 to 5
passages before new cells were recovered from frozen master
stocks. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% FCS and 1% pen-strep. Cells were counted using a Vi-cell
cell counter (Beckman Coulter) on days 3 and 7.
Staining of MLEC
A total of 2  105 MLEC cells were plated on a coverslip in a 12well plate. The coverslips were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde for 30
minutes and washed with PBS (3 times for 5 minutes each).
Following ﬁxation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
for 20 minutes and washed again in PBS. The cover slips were
incubated with (1:200) rabbit IgG (R&D), (1: 300) Endomucin
antibody (Santa Cruz Sc-65495), IL6Ra antibody (1:200; Santa
Cruz C-20, Sc-661) overnight at 4 C. The following day, the cover
slips were incubated with secondary (1:2000) goat anti-rabbit
Alexa 488 (Life Technologies, A-11034) for 2 hours at room
temperature and then mounted on slides with Prolong Gold

DAPI containing medium (Invitrogen, P36931). The images were
taken using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 META).
Western blotting
A total of 2  105 MLEC or HUVECs were plated in a 6-well
plate with 2 mL MLEC medium (10%FBS). The following day, the
supernatant was removed and the cells were treated with VEGF (30
ng/mL), human IL6 (30 ng/mL), or mouse IL6 (30 ng/mL) in 2 mL
of serum-free MLEC medium for 6 hours or 24 hours. Cells were
then washed with PBS and harvested using RIPA Buffer (R0278,
Sigma) with 1 proteinase inhibitors. Protein quantiﬁcation was
performed using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts (25 mg) were run
on a NuPAGE Novex 4% to 12% Bis-Tris Gels, 1.5 mm and
transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was blocked
overnight (4 C in PBS with 0.1% Tween and 5% milk powder)
and probed using the following antibodies: Jagged1 (1:1000,
Abcam ab7771), DLL4 (1:1000, Abcam ab7280), Ang2 (1:500,
Abcam ab8452), Hey1 (1:500, Abcam ab22614), Phospho-Stat3
(Tyr705) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology 9145), Stat3
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology 4904), p-ERK (1:1000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology sc-7383), ERK (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology 9102), b-Actin (1:5000, Sigma A5316/). A rabbit or mouse
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE
Healthcare) incubation allowed visualization using enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration
equivalence was conﬁrmed by anti–b-actin antibody.
Scratch wound migration assay
Conﬂuent monolayers of MLEC cells were scratched with a p20
pipette tip, cells were then washed twice with PBS before the
addition of serum-free growth medium with VEGF 100 ng/mL,
hIL6 100 ng/mL, and mIL6 100 ng/mL. Wounds were monitored
by time lapse microscopy using an Olympus IX81 Microscope
Hamamatsu Orca ER digital camera. Images were acquired every
30 minutes and subsequently analyzed using ImageJ software.
Cell proliferation assay
Of note, 70,000 MLEC cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. The
following day cells were treated with either 50 or 100 ng/mL of
VEGF, human IL6, or mouse IL6. The plate was then incubated for
72 hours at 37 C and 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were
trypsinized and counted using the Vi-cell counter (Beckman
Coutler). Each condition was repeated in triplicate.
In vivo IGROV-1 xenografts
A total of 1  107 luciferase-expressing IGROV-1 cells (IGROV1luc) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into 20 g 6- to 8-weekold female BALB/c nu/nu mice (purchased from Charles River, UK
Ltd.). After 24 hours, anti-IL6 antibody (MEDI5117) was prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/kg in sterile, endotoxin-free PBS
and mice were injected i.p with 200 mL of this solution twice
weekly for 4 weeks. Control mice were injected with 200 mL of 20
mg/kg IgG control antibody. MEDI5117 is a human IgG1k
monoclonal antibody that binds to IL6 with sub-pM afﬁnity and
neutralizes it by preventing the binding to IL6Ra. MEDI5117 was
generated using phage display technology. It bears a triple mutation (referred to as YTE) in the Fc domain of the heavy chain that
extends its half-life in circulation. MEDI5117 is active in several
preclinical cancer models, including NSCLC, prostate cancer,
breast cancer, and ovarian cancer (H. Zhong and colleagues; Mol
Cancer Ther, in revision). An IgG1 isotype control antibody was

some of the animals were anesthetized after 4 weeks of treatment
and injected with FITC-conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum lectin
(tomato lectin; 100 mL, 2 mg/mL; Vector Laboratories) via the tail
vein 3 minutes before animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde under terminal anesthesia. Samples were processed
and frozen sections were cut for immunocytochemistry analysis
for pericyte markers. The frozen sections from the lectin stained in
vivo sections were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30
minutes and washed three times in PBS. The sides were incubated

Results
IL6 stimulates angiogenesis in the aortic ring assay
As we had found that anti-human IL6 reduced tumor blood
vessel density in human tumor xenografts (7), we tested the
activity of human IL6 in the aortic ring assay. This is an ex vivo
model of angiogenesis that studies the effects of mediators on
normal vessel sprouting. Optimal vessel sprouting was observed
in the mouse aortic ring assay 7 to 10 days after treatment with 30
ng/mL VEGF or 50 ng/mL hIL6 (Fig. 1A). Mouse IL6 (30 ng/mL) in
mouse aortas and rat IL6 (10 ng/mL) in rat aortas also stimulated
vessel sprouting and there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
number of sprouts between the VEGF and IL6 treatments (Fig.
1B). VEGF and IL6 treatments also gave similar results in terms of
length of vessel sprouts (Fig. 1C).
Other reports have described that IL6 has indirect angiogenic
activity via stimulation of VEGF production, and thus inhibition
of VEGF action would also block IL6 activity (17). We therefore
tested the action of the VEGF receptor inhibitor cediranib in the rat
aortic ring assay. Cediranib signiﬁcantly inhibited the sprouting
activity of VEGF but had no signiﬁcant activity on the actions of
IL6 in this model (Fig. 1D). This result suggested that in the aortic
ring model IL6 may stimulate vessel sprout formation without
inducing VEGF. To demonstrate that IL6Ra is required for IL6mediated angiogenesis, we added an anti-IL6Ra antibody to the
IL6-simulated aortic ring cultures. This abolished the effect of IL6

(data not shown). We also found that the endothelial cells of the
aortic ring vessels expressed IL6 receptor, staining positive for the
gp80 IL6Ra; Fig. 1E). Furthermore, Western blot analyses of
lysates from the aortic ring assay showed strong induction of
STAT3 phosphorylation by mouse IL6 but only weak induction by
VEGF (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, there was
strong phosphorylation of ERK in VEGF-stimulated aortic ring
lysates but IL6 had no effect (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1).
As the aortic ring assay has a mixture of cells that could
complicate any analysis of signaling pathways, we used a simpler
experimental system in our next set of experiments, the MLEC
mouse endothelial cell line (16).
IL6 has direct effects on endothelial cells
MLECs stained with the endothelial cell marker endomucin
express IL6Ra (Fig. 2A), and both human and mouse IL6 at 100
ng/mL stimulated MLEC proliferation (Fig. 2B). The IL6 effect was
not as potent as that of VEGF but was still signiﬁcant. VEGF and
human and mouse IL6 were equally potent in the "scratch" assay,
which measured MLEC migration (Fig. 2C). We then used Western blotting to study the VEGF and IL6 signaling pathways in these
cells. As expected, IL6 increased STAT3 phosphorylation and

www.aacrjournals.org

VEGF increased ERK phosphorylation, but IL6 stimulation did
not affect phospho-ERK levels and VEGF had no effect on phospho-STAT3 (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2) after 24 hours of
treatment. Similar results were observed in HUVEC after treatment with human IL6 (hIL6) or VEGF (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Earlier time points (2 and 6 hours) were also studied with similar
results (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that in both the
aortic ring assay and in cultures of MLEC cells, IL6 has direct effects
on endothelial cells.
Pericyte coverage is defective in IL6-stimulated vessels
Over the 7 to 10 days mouse aortic ring assay incubation
period, and the 4 days of the rat aortic ring assay, pericytes also
develop around the endothelial cells of the vessel sprouts when
they are stimulated by VEGF. Using a-SMA as a pericyte marker,
we treated mouse aortic rings with VEGF, mouse or human IL6,
and rat aortic rings with rat IL6, and we noticed that pericyte
coverage was diminished in the IL6-stimulated cultures. Overall,
there were less pericytes attached to the tips of the IL6-stimulated
vessels compared with the VEGF cultures and many detached
pericytes were observed in the presence of IL6 (Fig. 3A–C). This
difference between number of pericytes associated with the sprout

results were observed with another pericyte marker NG2 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Differences in VEGF and IL6 signaling may explain defective
pericyte coverage
We hypothesized that differential regulation of Notch family
members may be involved in the differences in pericyte coverage
between IL6- and VEGF-treated cultures. High levels of the Notch
ligand DLL4 in endothelial cells are associated with vessel maturity and good pericyte coverage (18–20). Another Notch ligand,
Jagged1, is associated with increased vessel sprouting and less
mature vessels (21, 22). We ﬁrst investigated this hypothesis in
MLEC cells. Using Western blotting, we found that 24 hours of
treatment with IL6 and VEGF differentially regulated the expression of DLL4 and Jagged1. Although IL6 stimulated more Jagged1
than did VEGF, VEGF had a greater effect on DLL4 than on Jagged1
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S5A). We also observed this
differential regulation in IL6 and VEGF-treated aortic ring lysates
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S5B). VEGF stimulation of DLL4
leads to increased activation of the HEY transcription factor (21).
VEGF treatment of MLEC cells increased levels of HEY, whereas
IL6 had no effect (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5A). As Ang2 is
implicated in the detachment of pericytes from blood vessels (23–
29), we next investigated whether IL6 also induced Ang2. Figure
4D shows that both VEGF and IL6 induced Ang2 in both MLEC
and the aortic ring model, but IL6 had a stronger effect (Fig. 4D
and E and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). An earlier time point
of 6 hours treatment in MLEC with mIL6 or VEGF gave similar
results (Supplementary Fig. S5C). This was also observed in
HUVEC after treatment with hIL6 or VEGF (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Figure 4F is a summary diagram showing mechanism of
action of VEGF or IL6 on endothelial cells. Binding of VEGF to
VEGF receptor leads to upregulation of DLL4, resulting in angiogenesis and maturation of vessels. However, IL6 binds to IL6
receptors to activate Jagged1 and Ang2, resulting in angiogenesis
with defective pericyte coverage.
Relevance of these ﬁndings to malignant disease
Our results so far would suggest that anti-IL6 treatment would
increase pericyte coverage of tumor blood vessels. We previously
reported that when peritoneal xenografts of IGROV-1 ovarian
cancer cells, that constitutively produce IL6, were treated with
anti-human IL6 antibodies, vessel density was reduced, as was
Jagged1 mRNA and protein (7). We repeated these experiments
with the anti-human IL6 neutralizing antibody MEDI5117, this
time assessing pericyte coverage of the vessels. Using a-SMA (Fig.
5A) and NG2 (Fig. 5B) as pericyte markers, we found that anti-IL6
treatment increased pericyte coverage. The sections were scored
blind for the level of pericyte coverage of the tumor blood vessels
and the effect of anti-IL6 was statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 5C;
Supplementary Fig. S7A shows an example of the way pericyte
coverage was scored).

In addition, IHC of the anti-IL6–treated tumors showed
decreased Jagged 1 and Ang2 staining and increased DLL4 protein
(Fig. 5D). The IHC results were scored blind and the results are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S7B. This was conﬁrmed in Western
blot analyses of tumor lysates (Fig. 5E and Supplementary
Fig. S7C).
Correlations from human ovarian cancer biopsies
Finally, we revisited a previously published analysis of mRNAs
that are associated with high IL6 expression (7) using publically
available datasets of ovarian cancer. Ang2 and Jagged1 had
signiﬁcant a coefﬁcient of correlation with high IL6 expression
(P ¼ 0.015 and P ¼ 0.001, respectively; Fig. 6A). Further in-depth
analysis of these associations was carried out on RNAseq data
from 27 samples of omental metastases from patients with stage
III/IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). The samples were
divided into three groups based on histologic analysis; uninvolved omental tissue, established tumor, and stroma with low
tumor burden postchemotherapy. Figure 6B shows typical histology of each group. Only within the established tumor groups
was a strong and signiﬁcant correlation (Spearman r) seen
between IL6, Jagged 1, and Ang2 mRNA (Fig. 6C). There was no
signiﬁcant correlation between IL6 and DLL4 mRNA in the same
samples (data not shown).

Discussion
A role for IL6 in pathogenic angiogenesis has been suggested in
diseases such as stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, and various cancers
(1, 30, 31). In a previous publication, we showed that treatment of
ovarian cancer xenografts with an anti-IL6 antibody reduced the
tumor vasculature with concomitant inhibition of the NOTCH
ligand Jagged1, which has been implicated in vessel sprouting (7).
Collectively, the published literature suggested that IL6 could
drive abnormal angiogenesis and that the anti-IL6 antibody had a
potential as antiangiogenic agent. Thus, we investigated the direct
effects of IL6 on normal angiogenesis using endothelial in vitro
and ex vivo studies, and used the ﬁndings from those studies to
explore its importance in tumor angiogenesis using peritoneal
models of ovarian cancer and ovarian cancer biopsies.
We found that IL6 is as potent as VEGF in inducing vessel
sprouting in the aortic ring assay and was also able to stimulate
endothelial cell migration and proliferation in MLEC cells. VEGFR
inhibition studies in the aortic ring model and protein analysis of
downstream VEGF and IL6 signaling indicate that the angiogenic
effects observed with IL6 may not depend on VEGF in endothelial
cells. The effects on IL6 on malignant cells may be different
because of the complex autocrine signaling networks generated
in cancer cells. Preliminary experiments on malignant cell lines
showed that, in contrast with endothelial cells, IL6 can stimulate
VEGF signaling and vice versa. In addition, in the RNAseq experiments of Fig. 6, we found that there was a positive association
between IL6 and VEGF mRNA levels, but this would be expected

(Continued.) Treatment with anti-IL6 antibody was able to restore the pericyte coverage in IGROV-1 xenografts. Staining of a-SMA and NG2 staining shows poor
or detached pericyte coverage in the IgG antibody group compared with good pericyte coverage in the anti-IL6–treated group. C, quantiﬁcation of the
staining shows a signiﬁcant difference between the IGROV-1 antibody control and anti-IL6–treated group (P < 0.001). The quantiﬁcation carried out by two
2
independent reviewers was analyzed using c test (n ¼ 6 per group from two independent experiments). D, IHC staining for Jagged1, DLL4, and Ang2 in the
IGROV-1 xenograft following 4 weeks of treatment with anti-IL6 antibody. The images were taken from ﬁve randomly selected areas per tumor section
(n ¼ 6 per group from two independent experiments) using a 40 microscope. E, Western blot analysis of DLL4 and Ang2 from protein extracted from in vivo
IGROV-1 xenografts treated with anti-IL6 antibody.

Relevance of these ﬁndings to malignant disease. Gene expression data from 285 ovarian cancer biopsies from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS) dataset
along with 245 samples obtained by merging two other publicly available datasets were ranked for expression of IL6 pathway genes. Then, 50 samples
with the highest (high IL6) and 50 samples with the lowest (low IL6) levels of expression were selected and from that a list was generated of the differentially
expressed genes between the high and low IL6 samples. These differentially expressed genes were then associated with various pathways and processes.
Signiﬁcant associations were found between the high IL6 pathway gene expression and with various processes including angiogenesis. A, the high IL6 pathway
expression correlated positively with Jagged1 and Ang2. RNAseq analysis of omental metastases from patients with stage III–IV high-grade serous ovarian
cancer. The 27 tumor samples were divided into three groups based on histologic analysis: uninvolved omental tissue, established tumors, and stroma with low
tumor burden post chemotherapy. B, signiﬁcant positive correlation was observed between expression levels for IL6, Jagged 1, and Ang2 mRNA, and the best-ﬁt
correlation (Spearman r) was found in samples that had a high burden of tumor.

when studying isolates from a complex multicellular tumor
microenvironment. Hence, we suspect that IL6 may have different
effects on malignant cells and endothelial cells.
We found that the angiogenesis stimulated by IL6 leads to
formation of vasculature with defective pericyte coverage, and that
anti-IL6 treatment of the peritoneal ovarian cancer xenografts
leads to restoration of pericytes on the blood vessels. Investigating
the mechanism of action of IL6 and VEGF in inducing this
different phenotype of vessel maturation has shown roles for
Notch ligands and Ang2.
This is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst study showing that IL6 can
induce a type of vessel sprouting with abnormal pericyte coverage
compared with VEGF. These observations have clinical implications for malignant and other diseases, especially as studies in
various cancers suggest that pericyte depletion leads to increased
metastasis (23, 32, 33). The ability of anti-IL6 treatment to
improve pericyte coverage of vessels in xenograft models suggests
that in the tumor microenvironment, defective pericyte coverage
may be due to the action of IL6 in those tumors with high levels of
this cytokine.
The regulation of Ang2 by IL6 is another interesting ﬁnding
as Ang2 expression has been shown to correlate with lymph

node metastasis in various cancers (34–36). Moreover, the
angiopoietin inhibitor trebananib increased progression-free
survival in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (37).
As STAT3 signaling is implicated in the treatment failure of
various anti-angiogenic agents (13, 38–40), combinations of
IL6 and angiogenesis antagonists may be worthy of further
study.
