ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in women.
Adjuvant systemic chemotherapies are effective in reducing risks of recurrence and
have contributed to reduced BC mortality. Although targeted adjuvant treatments
determined by biomarkers for endocrine and HER2-directed therapies are largely
successful, predicting clinical benefit from chemotherapy is more challenging. Drug
resistance is a major reason for treatment failures. Efforts are ongoing to find
biomarkers to select patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Importantly,
cell surface biomarkers CD44+/CD24– are linked to drug resistance in some reports,
yet underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This study focused on the potential
role of CD24 expression in resistance to either docetaxel or doxorubicin in part by
the use of triple-negative BC (TNBC) tissue microarrays. In vitro assays were also
done to assess changes in CD24 expression and differential drug susceptibility
after chemotherapy. Further, mouse tumor xenograft studies were done to confirm
in vitro findings. Overall, the results show that patients with CD24-positive TNBC
had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival after taxane-based
treatment. Also, in vitro cell studies show that CD44+/CD24+/high cells are more
resistant to docetaxel, while CD44+/CD24–/low cells are resistant to doxorubicin.
Both in vitro and in vivo studies show that cells with CD24-knockdown are more
sensitive to docetaxel, while CD24-overexpressing cells are more sensitive to
doxorubicin. Further, mechanistic studies indicate that Bcl-2 and TGF-βR1 signaling
via ATM-NDRG2 pathways regulate CD24. Hence, CD24 may be a biomarker to select
chemotherapeutics and a target to overcome TNBC drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

remains the mainstay to improve survival in high-risk
BC patients [2, 3]. Resistance to chemotherapy is a
key factor in treatment failure. Better understanding of
drug resistance mechanisms is crucial to advance BC
management.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a BC subtype
defined by lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors
and absence of HER2 amplification [4]. As compared
with other BC subtypes, TNBC patients have significantly
worse prognosis despite use of chemotherapy [5]. Since
there are no currently-approved targeted treatments for
TNBC, chemotherapy is a standard intervention, yet patients
often suffer early disease recurrence and metastasis due to
development of drug resistance.
Cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24) is a small GPIlinked membrane glycoprotein with glycosylation sites
that bind P-selectin [6]. As an adhesion molecule, CD24
is widely expressed in many cancer types, including renal,
ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers [7–9]. CD24 expression
is also suggested to be a candidate marker for prognosis in
breast cancer [10]. The CD44+/CD24− phenotype is among
the most widely studied biomarkers for breast cancer stem
cells (CSC), but the clinical impact of these reported CSC
biomarkers remains controversial [11, 12]. CD44+/CD24-/low
BC cells are reported to have tumor-initiating properties [12]
and enhanced invasive activity [13]. Clinically, tumors with
a higher fraction of CD44+/CD24- cells are more commonly
found in patients with distant metastases [14] and associate
with poor clinical outcome [15]. Recent studies indicate
TNBCs also have higher representation of CD44+/CD24cells [13, 15, 16], particularly among African American
versus Caucasian women [17].
A cellular process that converts adherent epithelial
cells into mesenchymal-like cells with the ability to
migrate and invade adjacent tissues is termed epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), and the reverse process
is designated mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)
[18]. Recently, breast cancer cells were reported to transit
between EMT and MET states and to play different
biologic roles during metastasis [19]. The biomarker set
CD44+/CD24−/low associates with more aggressive clinicalpathological features in BC [20]. CD44+/CD24−/low cells
generally display a mesenchymal phenotype [19, 21],
while CD44+/CD24+/high cells tend to associate with more
differentiated epithelial features [22].
Previous reports indicate that CD24 is involved in
EMT-MET transitions in breast cancer cells. However, the
association of a CD44+/CD24−/low population with the clinical
outcome of patients with breast cancer and drug resistance,
particularly to specific types of chemotherapeutics, is
unclear [23]. Further, little is known about the regulatory
mechanism for CD24 expression. Our earlier work indicated
that treatment of BC cells with docetaxel induces the
transition of BC cells from a CD44+/CD24−/low phenotype
to a CD44+/CD24+/high phenotype that is more resistant to
docetaxel [24]. Later, work by Goldman et al. supported
our findings on such antitumor drug-induced phenotypic
plasticity [25, 26]. In contrast, some studies suggest that
CD44+/CD24−/low cells are more resistant to chemotherapy,
and that patients with tumors containing CD44+/CD24−/low
cells have worse survival [27, 28]. These contrasting data
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

highlight the complexities in defining the role of CD24 in
TNBC responses to therapy. In this work, we focused on in
vitro and in vivo studies of CD24 expression and potential
underlying signaling pathways in TNBC drug resistance.

RESULTS
Docetaxel and doxorubicin regulate CD24
expression in a different manner
Drug-resistant cells are generally considered to be
represented by cells that survive chemotherapy treatment.
To study the relationship between CD24 functions
and drug resistance, we treated cells with the two most
commonly used drugs for TNBC, namely docetaxel and
doxorubicin, and CD44/CD24 expression was tested
before and after treatments. Overall, we investigated eight
TNBC cell lines and compared these with six BC cell
lines of other subtypes including three luminal and three
HER2 positive cells, with representative results shown
in Figure 1. In Supplementary Table 1, four of the eight
TNBC cells had a main population of CD44+/CD24−/low
cells. Of the three HER2+ cell lines tested, only JIMT-1
had a large population of CD44+/CD24−/low, and the
remaining were CD44+/CD24+/high. All luminal cell lines
were CD44+/-/CD24+/high. The gating method and control
information were described in Supplementary Figure 1.
After doxorubicin treatment, all CD44+/CD24−/low
cell lines remained unchanged, while CD44+/CD24+/high
cell lines showed decreased CD24 expression in the
surviving cells (Figure 1; and data not shown). In contrast,
cells responded differently after docetaxel treatment. All
CD44+/CD24−/low cell lines had increased CD24 expression
after docetaxel treatment (Figure 1; and data not shown).
Both HCC1937 and HCC38 cells are CD44+/CD24+/high;
however, HCC1937 cells showed no change in CD24
expression, while HCC38 cells showed a decrease in
CD24 expression after docetaxel treatment. Overall,
our results suggest doxorubicin induces suppression
of CD24 expression in CD44+/CD24+/high cells, while
docetaxel may decrease, increase or have no effect on
CD24 expression in different cell lines. Our results also
indicate that sensitivities of TNBC cells to the two drugs
associate with the CD24 phenotype of surviving cells
after drug treatments. The decreased CD24 expression
in HCC1937 cells after doxorubicin and increased CD24
in HCC1806 cells after docetaxel as shown by FACS
analyses were also confirmed by Western blot experiments
(Supplementary Figure 2). Because CD24 expression
in these cell lines changed rapidly after only a very
short time of drug treatment before cell death occurred
(Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure 2 and data not shown),
the observed changes were less likely due to selective
killing of particular cell populations.
To study whether expression of other important cancer
biomarkers also change after chemotherapy treatment under

the same experimental conditions, we tested CD133 and
CD49f markers using FACS and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity using an established Aldefluor assay.
In comparison with CD24 expression after the two drug
treatments, ALDH, CD133 and CD49f displayed different
patterns of expression with no clear correlates or trends
identified. (Supplementary Figure 3 and data not shown)

Figure 2D, 2E and 2F, the new CD44+/CD24−/low population
induced by either docetaxel or doxorubicin was sorted out
and found to be more resistant to doxorubicin compared
with the CD44+/CD24+/high population of the same cell lines,
whereas the new CD44+/CD24+/high population induced by
docetaxel was more resistant to docetaxel compared with
the CD44+/CD24−/low population. In HCC38 cells, docetaxel
sensitivity was improved in newly-induced CD44+/CD24−/
low
cells. These results suggest- that CD44+/CD24+/high cells
were highly resistant to docetaxel, and CD44+/CD24−/
low
cells were resistant to doxorubicin. Most of the cells
became more resistant to the drugs after treatment in
accord with the level of CD24 expression in surviving
cells. Although HCC38 cells showed an induced population
with decreased CD24 expression after docetaxel, the main
population remained CD44+/CD24+/high, and continued to
be docetaxel-resistant. These observations suggest that the
drug resistance of tested cell lines is regulated by and/or
associated with CD24 expression levels.

CD24 expression levels correlate with drug
resistance
To test the hypothesis that CD24 expression
affects drug resistance, we performed drug sensitivity
assays of different cell lines treated with either
docetaxel or doxorubicin. The results show that cell
lines with predominant populations of CD44+/CD24+/high
cells (HCC1187, MDA-MB-468 and HCC38) were
more resistant to docetaxel, while cell lines with main
populations of CD44+/CD24−/low cells (MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436 and HCC1806) were more resistant to
doxorubicin (Figure 2A). Similar results were found
using drug treatment in 3D culture assays (Figure 2B).
In suspension conditions, the CD24+ cell line HCC1937
became much more sensitive to doxorubicin (Figure 2C).
Because CD24 expression can be altered by drug
treatment, we next determined the drug sensitivity of those
cells remaining after chemotherapy treatment. As shown in

Targeting CD24 or its inhibitor NDRG2
overcomes drug resistance
To determine whether CD24 and potential CD24
downstream signaling regulate drug resistance, we used
specific shRNAs in vitro to suppress expression of CD24
or the CD24 inhibitor NDRG2 [29]. After knockdown

(Figure 3H) as predicted by the in vitro data. Statistical
analysis of tumor shrinkage under different conditions as
in Figure 3I demonstrate that inhibition of CD24 reduces
docetaxel resistance, while increasing CD24 or suppressing
CD24 inhibition improves doxorubicin sensitivity.
These results suggest that targeting or modulating CD24
expression may overcome drug resistance in TNBC.

of CD24 in 3D culture, HCC1806 cells became more
sensitive to docetaxel (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells
with NDRG2 knockdown became more resistant to
docetaxel and more sensitive to doxorubicin. Knockdown
efficiency is shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Similar
results were observed in another cell line, HCC1937, with
knockdown of CD24 expression (Figure 3B). Conversely,
overexpression of CD24 in HCC1806 leads to increased
doxorubicin sensitivity (Figure 3C and 3D), a result
consistent with enhancement of CD24 by suppression of
the CD24 inhibitor NDRG2 as above.
To confirm our in vitro data, in vivo studies were
conducted in a tumor xenograft model. As shown in
Figure 3E and 3F, TNBC HCC1806 tumor xenografts with
NDRG2 knockdowns showed marked tumor reduction
after doxorubicin treatment as compared to controls. On
the other hand, tumors of HCC1806 cells with CD24
knockdown demonstrated significant tumor reduction after
docetaxel treatment as compared to controls (Figure 3G).
Another TNBC line MDA-MB-231-with knockdown of
CD24 also showed improved tumor response to docetaxel

TGF-βR1 and Bcl-2 regulate CD24 expression
and drug sensitivities
To investigate why docetaxel elicited variable
CD24 expression in different BC cell lines, we focused
on signaling pathways that could mediate observed
phenomenon associated with CD24 expression. Of these,
Bcl-2 was selected due to its reported involvement in
paclitaxel resistance [30]. The CD44+/CD24−/low phenotype
is shown to be related to EMT [21], and our results show
that HCC1806 cells undergo partial MET after docetaxel
treatment; and MDA-MB-468 cells undergo EMT after
doxorubicin treatment (Supplementary Figure 4). Since

TGF-β is one of the most important inducers of EMT
and is a secreted protein [31], TGF-βR1 is generally
considered to reflect TGF-β downstream signaling [32].
Hence, TGF-βR1 was also selected for evaluation in
the current study. We used gene microarrays to search
for downstream signaling of Bcl-2 and TGF-β. The
most differentially-expressed genes were listed in
Supplementary Tables  2 and  3. Of interest, the ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway was markedly
inhibited in HCC1806 cells by treatment with docetaxel
(Figure 4B; Supplementary Table  4) and was therefore
assessed further. Previous reports showed that increased
expression of Twist and reduced expression of CD24
contribute to EMT and to CSC self-renewal through
activation of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathways
in liver and breast cancers [33, 34]. As shown in Figure 4A,
ATM signaling correlated positively with NDRG2 and
STAT3 signaling as shown by simultaneous increase or
decrease of p-ATM with p-NDRG2 and p-STAT3. Based

on inhibitor treatments, our studies also show that ATM
stimulates NDRG2, and increased NDRG2 negatively
regulates ATM (Figure 5A and 5C). These results suggest
ATM is upstream of NDRG2 and is inhibited by NDRG2
via negative feedback loops. Using a similar approach, we
demonstrated that both TGF-βR1 and Bcl-2 were upstream
of ATM with TGF-βR1 being stimulatory and Bcl-2 being
inhibitory to ATM. Both docetaxel and doxorubicin
stimulated TGF-βR1 signaling. For Bcl-2, docetaxel
stimulated, while doxorubicin was suppressive; and
cyclophosphamide had no effect (Figure 6). Our results
also show that Bcl-2 expression in both CD44+/CD24+/high
cells -HCC1937 and HCC38- are very low. Further,
HCC38 had higher levels of TGF-βR1 expression than
HCC1937. Although CD44+/CD24−/low cells (HCC1806
and MDA-MB-231) had high levels of TGF-βR1
activity, Bcl-2 activities in these cells were even more
elevated thereby serving as a dominant signaling function
(Figure  6B). The expression of autophagy marker-

and in vivo. (A, B, C and D) After seeding in matrigel for 5-days, HCC1806 cells were treated with 20 nM docetaxel (DTX) or 1.5 µM

doxorubicin (DXR) for 4-days. HCC1937 cells were treated with 0.6 µM docetaxel. P-values of the compared groups were calculated
using unpaired t-tests for cell total area. (E) These data show the working scheme for treatments used in tumor xenograft experiments.

LC3B was next tested in CD24 knockdown and NDRG2
knockdown cell lines (Figure 6E). The results show that
CD24 knockdown elevates LC3B expression and NDRG2
knockdown diminishes LC3B levels in the tested cells and
suggest that CD24 might affect the autophagy process in
these cells.
Taken together, our results indicate that interactions
between Bcl-2/TGF-βR1 signaling regulate CD24mediated drug resistance (Figure 6F). ATM stimulates
NDRG2 activity which negatively regulates CD24.
Doxorubicin may inhibit Bcl-2 and leave TGF-βR1
signaling unopposed, which leads to ATM stimulation and
reduction of CD24 expression. In contrast, docetaxel may
stimulate both TGF-βR1 and Bcl-2 signaling. Whether
docetaxel stimulates or inhibits ATM appears to depend
on the balance between activities of TGF-βR1 and Bcl-2
signaling. When Bcl-2 signaling dominates over TGF-βR1
signaling, ATM is inhibited, and vice-versa.

Molecular findings on the involvement of these
key factors in drug resistance were also confirmed at
the cellular level (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figures 5
and 6). Briefly, knockdown of Bcl-2 elicits a decrease
of CD24 expression in HCC1937 and HCC1806
cells; knockdown of TGF-βR1 increases CD24 only
in HCC1806 but not in HCC 1937 because of its high
basal level. Knockdown of Bcl-2 also stimulates selfrenewal of HCC1806 cells in suspension culture; while
knockdown of TGF-βR1 or ATM kinase reduces selfrenewal in the same cells. Also knockdown of Bcl-2
induces differentiation (3D sphere-like structures)
of HCC1806 cells while knockdown of TGF-βR1 or
ATM kinase decreases differentiation of these cells in
3D culture. The effects of TGF-βR1, Bcl-2 and ATM
on cell drug sensitivities were confirmed using their
corresponding inhibitors in HCC1806 and HCC1937
cells (Supplementary Figure 6E and 6F).

p-NDRG2 and p-STAT3 were decreased when p-ATM was suppressed. (B) Gene microarray data show that expression of genes in the ATM

DISCUSSION

CD24 is a potential biomarker for selection of
chemotherapy regimens

It is commonly reported that negative/low
expression of CD24 is a characteristic biomarker of
promoting tumor initiation and progression [12]. Results
presented here demonstrated a unique mechanism of
differential resistance to chemotherapeutics determined
by CD24 and regulated in part by the balance of TGFβR1 and Bcl-2 signaling. Our findings on tumor
specimens from the clinic further supported that CD24
may be an important prognostic factor for TNBC patients
who receive taxane-based treatment. In accord with our
hypothesis, Chekhun et al. reported that TNBC patients
with CD24−/low tumors treated with doxorubicin-based
chemotherapy regimens CAF (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin and fluorouracil) or AC (doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide) had significantly worse survival
rates than those patients with CD24+/high tumors [28]. In
addition, Lee et al. reported that patients treated with
an AC regimen had a significantly shorter disease-free
interval [35]. Independent preclinical findings also show
that CD44+/CD24–/low BC cell subpopulations exhibit
resistance to anthracycline drugs [36, 37]. These several
clinical and preclinical reports support our hypothesis
that CD24–/low BC cells are resistant to anthracycline
treatment.
Our data also suggest that targeting CD24 and
its regulatory pathways can reduce drug resistance in
BC cells. When administering docetaxel to CD24−/low

We next explored clinical significance of CD24
expression in archival patient specimens. For survival
analysis, we selected 94 cases of TNBC patients who were
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. As a group, patients
with CD24−/low tumors had significantly better survival
than those with CD24+/high tumors (Figure  7A). Only
21 patients in the study cohort received anthracycline
(doxorubicin) without taxanes (either paclitaxel or
docetaxel). The better overall survival rate and disease free
survival rate of patients with CD24–/low tumors treated with
taxane-based regimens was even more evidenced after
excluding patients who received only doxorubicin (Figure
7B–7F). The relationship between CD24 expression and
TNBC recurrence was further supported by studying
a separate cohort of 9 cases shown in Supplementary
Table 5. The results showed that all patients with high
CD24 expression (2+ or 3+) before or after neoadjuvant
treatment developed recurrent disease (mean time to
recurrence 13.7 months) and all patients with low CD24
expression (0 or 1+) had no recurrent disease (mean
follow up 47.5 months). Patient #5 whose tumor was 1+
before neoadjuvant treatment but increased to 2+ after
taxane-based neoadjuvant treatment, later developed
recurrent disease. Clinicopathological characteristics of
patients whose tumors were included in the TNBC TMA
are addressed in Supplementary Table 6.

tumors, adding agent(s) to block a phenotype switch
from CD24−/low to CD24+/high may prevent development
of adaptive resistance to docetaxel. Similarly, applying
doxorubicin to CD24+/high tumors, while blocking the
transition from CD24+/high to CD24−/low phenotype, may
improve doxorubicin sensitivity of treated cells. Future
investigations in modulation of specific TNBC signaling
pathways involved in regulating CD24 may lead to new
therapeutic approaches. Our study further suggests that
sequential administration of doxorubicin and taxane
drugs may be more effective to improve TNBC treatment.
We show that treating with docetaxel in CD24−/low cells
first, followed by doxorubicin, significantly improves the
overall cytotoxic effect, whereas the reverse sequence
of these drugs in the same cells results in a significantly
reduced cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure 6C). Of note,
in CD24+/high TNBC cells, the reverse sequence of drug
administration (e.g., doxorubicin followed by docetaxel)
yields better results (Supplementary Figure 6D).
The EMT process facilitates tumor cell migration
through basement membrane, invasion into adjacent
tissues, and penetration into the circulation [38, 39].
However, distant metastases from these tumors often show
more differentiation with increased expression of luminal
epithelial marker CD24 [40]. In addition, TNBCs with
high CD24 expression associate with worse overall patient
survival and shorter distant metastasis-free survival than
tumors with low CD24 [23]. These observation may be
related to our finding of high recurrence rates in patients
with CD24+ TNBC who are treated with taxane-based
regimens, but further investigation is needed to clarify the
involvement of CD24 in metastasis as well as regulation
of the host immune response [23, 41].
It is well-established that a major reason for
treatment failure in patients with TNBC is development of
resistance to chemotherapies which leads to early relapse
or distant spread leading to patient death. Emerging
reports suggest that metastatic tumor cells may evade
cell death in part by the induction of autophagy, a tightlyregulated process involving the degradation of excessive,
damaged or unnecessary proteins or injured organelles
by lysosomal pathways to ensure the maintenance of
cell viability [42, 43]. Several studies now suggest that
autophagy plays an important role in cancer and in drug
resistance [43–47]. Autophagy may promote cell survival
in cancer cells treated with chemotherapy or lead to
autophagic tumor cell death depending on the duration or
extent of the induction of this process. As noted in our
work, the potential relationship between autophagy and
chemotherapeutic drugs is being explored in the context of
the regulation of autophagy by CD24 which is modulated,
in turn, by Bcl-2, ATM and associated signaling pathways
[46, 47]. Our studies using antisense tools to up-regulate
and down-regulate CD24 in breast cancer cells suggest a
relationship between CD24 expression and biomarkers
of autophagy in vitro. Whether autophagy is largely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic is unclear, but
independent efforts are underway to investigate autophagy
as a potential target of antitumor drugs and the targeting
of autophagy as a therapeutic strategy to modulate drug
resistance [43–47]. This work helps to contribute to that
effort [27, 45–47]. Further, the induction of autophagy in
cancer cells is also associated with inhibition of cell lysis
by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, suggesting that regulation of
autophagy may be important in the future development of
immunotherapeutic strategies to block immune escape by
TNBC [48].
Our findings to date suggest that regulation of CD24
expression in tumor cells is due in part to the balance of
Bcl-2 and TGF-βR1 signaling via downstream activities
of ATM and NDRG2, a notable tumor suppressor gene
product that regulates CD24 expression to decrease the
metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. Independent
reports concur with several aspects of our findings such as
the induction of ATM by doxorubicin in cardiac myocytes
[49] and TGFβ- induced apoptosis via ATM in epithelial
cells [50]. In addition, docetaxel is reported to enhance
B1/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 [51], while
Hao et al. report that down-regulation of Bcl-2 enhances
the sensitivity of polyploid cells to docetaxel [52]. How
the downstream signaling of CD24 causes the change in
sensitivity of tumor cells to taxane versus anthracylines
remains to be answered. Since autophagy was previously
reported to related closely to the CD44+/CD24- status in
TNBC cells [53], we assessed the autophagy biomarker
LC3B in cells with selective knockdown of CD24
expression or in those with suppression of the CD24
inhibitor NDRG2. The results show that knockdown of
CD24 led to a significant increase of autophagy marker
LC3B, while knockdown of NDRG2 reduced LC3B in
TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937 (see Figure 6E).
Importantly, independent reports also show that enhanced
autophagy in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells helped to
promote tumor cell survival after doxorubicin treatment
[54]. Also consistent with our findings was the report
that diminished levels of autophagy-initiating genes
caused MCF-7 and SKBR-3 cells to develop resistance
to taxane therapy [55]. Taken together with independent
research, this evidence suggests the hypothesis that
selective changes in CD24 expression may regulate the
drug sensitivities of tumor cells in part through modulation
of cellular autophagy status. Further, these data on the
identification of specific downstream pathways that
regulate CD24 may help to explain prior controversial
findings regarding the role of CD24 in drug resistance and
phenotypic plasticity in TNBC cells.
To further understand the mechanism of CD24regulated drug sensitivity in TNBC, we also assessed other
cancer stem cell markers, such as ALDH, CD133 and
CD49f. Interestingly, changes in the patterns of expression
of these other cancer stem cell markers were different
from those of CD24 expression. There was no clear trend
38302

of changes observed among different cell lines after the
two drug treatments. Thus, more studies are needed in the
future to define the potential relationships of other cancer
stem cell markers with drug resistance in breast cancers.
In summary, the current data suggest that CD24 is
a promising biomarker candidate to guide chemotherapy
selection in the clinic, particularly in choosing between
commonly-used TNBC therapeutics such as docetaxel and
doxorubicin. This strategy may potentially be applied in
future clinical trials and, if successful, could help to improve
chemotherapy selection for the benefit of TNBC patients.

(IACUC), with procedures performed under supervision
of UCLA’s Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine. Mice
were housed in aseptic conditions in micro-isolator cages
and were provided sterile food and water.
Tumor cells were adjusted to a concentration of
3 × 106 in 50 µl growth medium mixed with 50 µl matrigel.
100 µl cell suspension was injected subcutaneously using
a 25G sterile needle in the 4th mammary fat pad of each
mouse under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were then assigned
based on tumor size after one week and divided into 6
treatment groups with 5 mice/ group. Groups 1 and 2 were
injected with HCC1806 cells transfected with vector control
or NDRG2 shRNA. Groups 3 and 4 were injected with
HCC1806 cells transfected with vector control or CD24
shRNA. Groups 5 and 6 were injected with MDA-MB-231
cells transfected with vector control or CD24 shRNA.
Chemotherapy drugs were administered intraperitoneally
on days 9 and 14 after tumor inoculation. Groups 1 and 2
were treated with doxorubicin at 0.06 mg/120 µl/mouse and
Groups 3 to 6 were treated with docetaxel at 0.28 mg/120 µl/
mouse. Tumors were measured at specified time
points, with tumor volume calculated as follows: tumor
volume = ½(width)² × (length). At the end of experiments,
mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at 21 or 23 days
after tumor injection, and tumors were harvested.

follows: 0, 0–10% of positive tumor cells; 1+, 10–25% of
positive tumor cells; 2+, 25–50% of positive tumor cells;
3+, more than 50% of positive tumor cells. The cases
were divided into negative/low, if scored 0 or 1+, and
significantly positive cases, when scored as 3+. Patients
initially presenting with metastases of any type, local
or regional recurrence, or another primary cancer were
excluded (n = 10) from the survival analysis.

Statistics
All tests were two-sided, and p-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical calculations
were done with Graphpad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software,
Inc., La Jolla, U.S.A.) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond,
WA, U.S.A.). Individual statistical methods are described
in appropriate figure legends and other methods sections.

Tissue microarrays (TMA), regular tumor
tissue samples and corresponding clinical and
pathological database
A cohort of 94 TNBC specimens from the UCLA
Pathology Tumor Bank were used for tissue microarray
construction under IRB-approved protocols (#11-003372).
Clinical-pathological characteristics, treatments, and
outcomes of the 94 patients were abstracted from an IRBapproved retrospective database at the Revlon/UCLA
Breast Center (#11-000826).
To further confirm the relationship between CD24
expression and TNBC recurrence, we studied additional
9 patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy
(neoadjuvant or/and adjuvant). Tumor samples from these
9 cases were stained for CD24 by a laboratory researcher
and read by a breast pathologist. Both investigators were
blinded for clinical information. The standard IHC staining
protocol is described below.
