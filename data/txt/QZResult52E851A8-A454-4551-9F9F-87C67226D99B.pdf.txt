Abstract
The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase on the regulation
of the extrinsic tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2/DR5-mediated death
pathway in human melanoma cells. We revealed that total
ATM protein levels were high in some human melanoma lines
compared with normal cells. The basal levels of active form
ATM phospho-Ser1981 were also detectable in many melanoma
lines and could be further up-regulated by ;-irradiation. Pretreatment of several melanoma lines just before ;-irradiation
with the inhibitor of ATM kinase KU-55933 suppressed p53 and
nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) activation but notably increased
radiation-induced DR5 surface expression, down-regulated
cFLIP (caspase-8 inhibitor) levels, and substantially enhanced
exogenous TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ;-irradiation
in the presence of KU-55933 rendered TRAIL-resistant HHMSX
melanoma cells susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In
addition, suppression of ATM expression by the specific short
hairpin RNA also resulted in down-regulation of cFLIP levels,
up-regulation of surface DR5 expression, and TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in melanoma cells. Besides p53 and NF-KB, crucial
regulators of DR5 expression, transcription factor STAT3 is
known to negatively regulate DR5 expression. Suppression
of Ser727 and Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3 by KU-55933
reduced STAT3 transacting activity accompanied by elevation
in DR5 expression. Dominant-negative STAT3B also efficiently
up-regulated the DR5 surface expression and down-regulated
cFLIP levels in melanoma cells in culture and in vivo. Taken
together, our data show the existence of an ATM-dependent
STAT3-mediated antiapoptotic pathway, which on suppression
sensitizes human melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Introduction
The nuclear protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
plays an important role in signaling the presence of DNA doublestrand breaks to the cell cycle checkpoint machinery and to the
DNA repair system (1). Furthermore, ATM deficiency results in
neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and enhanced radiosensitivity, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in the regulation of
cell proliferation and cell death (2). ATM, together with ATR,
controls extensive protein networks encompassing >700 proteins

that are responsive to DNA damage (3). The important targets of
the ATM signaling pathways are transcription factors p53, nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB), ATF2, and STAT3, which are ultimately linked to
regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (1, 4–6). Ionizing
radiation and chemotherapy are the two main modalities for
cancer treatment. The cytotoxic effects of many anticancer drugs
and ionizing radiation are mediated through DNA damage
resulting in the activation of DNA damage-induced cell signaling
pathways, including activation of the ATM networks. In this
scenario, ATM kinase plays a crucial role by balancing cell cycle
arrest versus cell death (1).
The incidence of melanoma has substantially increased worldwide over the last 40 years. Most advanced melanomas respond
poorly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and no effective therapy
exists to inhibit the metastatic spread of this cancer (7). Alternative
therapies that have been suggested for inducing apoptosis in
cancer cells are based on the direct activation of the extrinsic death
signaling pathways using recombinant death ligands of the tumor
necrosis factor superfamily, such as tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), or agonistic monoclonal antibodies to TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) 2/DR5 and TRAIL-R1/DR4.
TRAIL-R2 could often be found on the surface of different types of
cancer cells, including melanoma cells, at higher expression levels
compared with TRAIL-R1 (8). In contrast to normal cells, the
expression of the decoy receptors TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 rarely
occurred in human melanomas. Targeting TRAIL-R-mediated
signaling pathways for induction of apoptosis is currently being
evaluated in multiple clinical trials for several cancer types (9, 10).
Finally, combined modality treatments, which may include girradiation and stimulation of the TRAIL-R-mediated pathways,
appear to be promising potential treatments to suppress cancer
development (11–13). Because ATM activity is strongly upregulated by g-irradiation, we address the role of ATM in the
regulation of apoptosis in human melanomas. The main aim of
the present study was to resolve the question of how inhibition of
ATM activity affected TRAIL-mediated extrinsic death pathway in
human melanoma cells.

Inhibition of ATM Enhances TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis
Irradiation procedures. To determine sensitivity to g-rays, the plates
with melanoma cells were exposed to radiation from a Gammacell 40
137
Cs irradiator.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of DR5 and FAS levels.
Surface levels of DR5 and FAS were determined by staining with the
phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies from eBioscience and BD
Biosciences. A FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) combined with the CellQuest program was used to perform flow cytometric
analysis.
Transfection and luciferase assay. The NF-nB luciferase reporter
containing two nB-binding sites, Jun2-Luc reporter (15), and the STAT-Luc
reporter containing three repeats of GAS sites were used to determine
NF-nB, AP-1, and STAT transactivation, respectively. Additional reporter
constructs used included DR5/TRAIL-R2-full-Luc, which contained 1.6 kb
upstream of the ATG site through intron 2 in the DR5 genomic locus
(16), a 1 kb cFLIP-promoter-Luc (17, 18), and p53RE-Luc (19). Transient
transfection of reporter constructs (1 Ag) together with pCMV-hgalactosidase (0.25 Ag) into 5  105 melanoma cells was done using
Lipofectamine (Life Technologies). Luciferase activity was determined using
the luciferase assay system (Promega) and was normalized based on hgalactosidase levels.
Mutational analysis of DR5 promoter. Mutations within the STATbinding site of the human TRAIL-R2/DR5 promoter and within the nB site
of the intron 2 were generated using DR5/TRAIL-R2-full-Luc construct (16)
and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene).
Suppression of ATM expression with short hairpin RNA. ATM
expression in melanoma cells was stably knocked down using pRetroSuper
constructs with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences corresponding to
positions 912 (ATM1) and 8,538 (ATM3) of the ATM transcript. Green
fluorescent protein (GFP) shRNA served as a mock control. These constructs have been kindly provided by Dr. Y. Shiloh (20). LU1205 melanoma
cells were transfected by shRNA constructs using Lipofectamine and
selected with 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin.
Apoptosis studies. Cells were exposed to soluble TRAIL (50 ng/mL)
alone or in combination with cycloheximide (2 Ag/mL). Different variants
of combined treatment were used, including g-irradiation (5 Gy), in the
presence or absence of specific inhibitors of signaling pathways followed
by TRAIL treatment. Apoptosis was then assessed by quantifying the
percentage of hypodiploid nuclei using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis.
Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates (50 Ag protein) were resolved
on SDS-PAGE and processed according to standard protocols. The monoclonal antibodies used for Western blotting included anti-h-actin (Sigma);
anti-FLIP (NF6; Axxora); anti-caspase-3 and -8; anti-ATM (D2E2) and antiphospho-ATM (Ser1981); anti-phospho-p53 (Ser15; Cell Signaling); and antiX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP; clone 48; BD Biosciences).
The polyclonal antibodies used included anti-TRAIL and anti-DR5 (Axxora);
anti-phospho-p53 (Ser20) and anti-total p53; anti-phospho-SAPK/c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK; Thr183/Tyr185) and anti-JNK; anti-phospho-p44/p42
mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) and anti-p44/p42 mitogenactivated protein kinase; anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) and anti-AKT; antipoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) and
anti-phospho-STAT3 (Ser727); and anti-Chk2 and anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr68;
Cell Signaling). The secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase; signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence
system (Amersham).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay was done for the detection of NF-nB DNA-binding activity as
described previously. Ubiquitous NF-Y DNA-binding activity was used as an
internal control (21).
Human melanoma transplant in nude mice. LU1205 cells (1  106)
stably transfected with control empty vector pBabe-puro or with STAT3h
expression construct were injected subcutaneously into 7-week-old athymic
nude mice BALB/c nu/nu (6 mice per group) obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory. Tumor growth was monitored every 2 days. Three weeks after
beginning of the experiments, the tumor were excised, weighted, and
subjected to histopathologic and immunochemical examination.

Statistical analysis. Data were calculated as mean and SD. Comparisons
of results between treated and control groups were made by the Students’
t tests. P V 0.05 between groups was considered significant.

Results
ATM levels and DR5 surface expression in human melanoma
cell lines. Two primary human fibroblast lines, MRC5 (ATM+/+)
and GM02052 (ATM / ), were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively, for comparing the expression levels of ATM
protein and its signaling pathways in human melanoma cells
(Fig. 1A and B). Autophosphorylation of ATM after g-irradiation
(22), with the subsequent ATM-Chk2-dependent phosphorylation
of p53-Ser20 (23) that are characteristic features of the ATM signaling pathway, are clearly deficient in ATM / fibroblast line
(Fig. 1A). In contrast to normal fibroblasts MRC5, human melanoma lines were characterized by increased protein levels of both
total ATM and its active form, ATM phospho-Ser1981 (Fig. 1B).
Basal p53 protein levels in melanoma lines were also correlated to
ATM protein levels. ATM levels in human melanocytes were similar
to levels in human fibroblasts (data not shown).
Numerous human melanoma lines express TRAIL-R2/DR5 on
their surface (12, 24). In contrast, surface expression of TRAIL-R1/
DR4 was found at marginal levels in many melanoma lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The remarkable exceptions were the
early melanomas WM1552C and SBcl2 (25) as well as ocular
melanoma OM431 (26), which exhibited the increased levels of
surface DR4. Interestingly, surface expression of DR5 in WM9
and LU1205 melanoma cells was substantially higher than in
HHMSX melanoma cells, showing an inverse correlation between
the basal ATM levels and DR5 surface expression (Fig. 1B and C).
Both MRC5 (ATM+/+) and GM02052 (ATM / ) fibroblasts
contained two cell subpopulations with zero and moderate levels
of DR5 on the cell surface, respectively. Although GM02052 cells
had a modest increase in the percentage of DR5-positive cells
(58%) compared with MRC5 (35%; Fig. 1C), the different genetic
background of these cell lines did not allow us to make a definite
conclusion concerning quantitative effects of ATM on the DR5
surface expression in fibroblasts. However, these data show that, in
the case of ATM deficiency, moderate levels of the DR5 surface
expression are observed in fibroblasts. Interestingly, ATM deficiency did not change the levels of surface FAS in fibroblasts (Fig. 1C).
Next, we used pRetroSuper constructs expressing ATM1 and ATM3
shRNA for stable suppression of ATM levels and GFP shRNA
as a mock control (20) in MRC5 cells. ATM1 shRNA caused f70%
decrease in total ATM protein levels of MRC5 cells that was
accompanied by modest increase in DR5 surface expression
(Fig. 1D), indicating a negative role of ATM in regulation of
DR5 expression.
TRAIL-R2/DR5 gene expression is a target for positive regulation
by g-irradiation in many cancer cell lines (27). Indeed, DR5 total
and surface levels and activity of the DR5 promoter were further
increased 6 to 16 h after irradiation of LU1205 cells, whereas, for
MRC5 and GM02052 fibroblasts, up-regulation of the surface DR5
expression was not pronounced (Figs. 1C and 2B and C). Because
activation of ATM kinase by DNA damage after g-irradiation is
involved in the up-regulation of the p53 and NF-nB pathways (28),
a role for ATM kinase in the regulation of DR5 gene expression, levels of NF-nB-dependent antiapoptotic proteins, and TRAILmediated apoptosis in melanoma cells was further investigated in
this study.

Inhibition of ATM kinase in ;-irradiated melanoma cells
reduced p53 and NF-KB activities and cFLIP levels. gIrradiation of LU1205 cells induced autophosphorylation and
up-regulation of ATM kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A) that was accompanied by further activation of Chk2 and
Chk2-mediated Ser20 phosphorylation of p53. On the other hand,
direct ATM-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 was observed
at low levels. KU-55933 (10 Amol/L), a specific inhibitor of ATM
kinase activity (29), suppressed ATM autophosphorylation after
irradiation and caused down-regulation of p53 phospho-Ser20 levels
(Fig. 2B) and NF-nB DNA-binding activity (Fig. 2C), which was
accompanied by a decrease of general p53- and NF-nB-dependent

gene expression in the irradiated cells (Fig. 2C). KU-55933 was less
effective for inhibition of the basal NF-nB activity compared with
BMS-345541 (20 Amol/L), a specific inhibitor of IKK-NF-nB. Both
inhibitors were equally effective in the suppression of the radiationinduced NF-nB activity (Fig. 2C). Luciferase assay also showed
down-regulation of the cFLIP promoter activity with KU-55933
(Fig. 2C), which was accompanied by decrease in cFLIP-S and
cFLIP-L protein levels detected by Western blotting 8 h after
treatment with KU-55933 in both nonirradiated and g-irradiated
cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the DR5 promoter activity and total DR5
protein levels modestly increased 4 to 6 h after irradiation,
especially in the presence of KU-55933 (Fig. 2B and C). The

Inhibition of ATM Enhances TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis

observed decrease in p53 and NF-nB activities following inhibition
of ATM kinase activity by KU-55933 in g-irradiated cells correlated
with a substantial up-regulation of G2-M arrest of the cell cycle.
This was likely due to a failure to arrest in S phase (29, 30), a
characteristic feature of ATM deficiency in both LU1205 melanoma
cells and TIG3 human fibroblasts. KU-55933 up-regulated levels
of G2-M arrest in irradiated normal TIG3 fibroblasts were higher
compared with treated cancer cells (Fig. 2D).
Inhibition of ATM activity increased the sensitivity of
melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. DNA repair
mechanisms might permit the cells to overcome the consequences
of the DNA damage. However, suppression of ATM activity after
g-irradiation in the presence of KU-55933 could exert an alternative
effect on the apoptotic machinery in the cells via regulation of
expression of the components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
KU-55933 efficiently up-regulated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of
LU1205 and WM35 cells (Fig. 3A and D), probably due to downregulation of cFLIP levels, which was quite similar to cFLIP-RNA

interference-mediated suppression of cFLIP and the subsequent
up-regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells (24).
Down-regulation of basal cFLIP protein levels by KU-55933 was
dependent on down-regulation of cFLIP gene expression (Fig. 2C)
followed by proteasome-dependent degradation of cFLIP and
could be blocked with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (data not
shown). On the other hand, cleavage of procaspase-8 and
procaspase-3 and the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase and XIAP p57 were well pronounced 6 h after
treatment by a combination of KU-55933 and TRAIL. XIAP p57 and
cFLIP levels were also effectively down-regulated by treatment with
TRAIL alone via caspase cascade (Fig. 3A). A detailed analysis
of cFLIP-L levels after treatment with KU-55933 or TRAIL in the
presence or absence of a universal caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk,
and a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, Ac-IETD-CHO, was also performed (Supplementary Fig. S2). Results obtained clearly showed a
caspase-independent down-regulation of cFLIP levels 2 to 4 h after
treatment with KU-55933 and caspase-dependent down-regulation

6 h after treatment. Hence, the initial decrease in cFLIP-L levels
after treatment with KU-55933 was not a result of apoptosis,
whereas the late decrease in cFLIP-L levels was indeed a consequence of apoptosis. Levels of apoptosis determined 48 h after
treatment were substantially higher for a combination of TRAIL
and KU-55933 than for TRAIL alone (Fig. 3D).
Efficacy of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis could be further increased
through radiation-induced up-regulation of the total and surface
DR5 expression (12), which was positively controlled by p53 and
NF-nB (16, 31). As expected, BMS-345541, a specific inhibitor of the
IKK-NF-nB pathway, suppressed NF-nB activation in melanoma
cells (Fig. 2C) and prevented radiation-induced up-regulation
of DR5 surface expression in WM35 and LU1205 cells (Fig. 3B).
Given the positive role for NF-nB and p53 in regulation of DR5
transcription (16, 31, 32), it was quite unexpected, however, that
instead of suppression of DR5 expression, we observed an additional up-regulation of the DR5 promoter activity (Fig. 2C) and DR5

surface expression after g-irradiation in the presence of KU-55933
(10 Amol/L) in four melanoma lines, WM35, LU1205, WM9, and
HHMSX (Fig. 3B; data not shown).
Hence, pretreatment of LU1205 and WM35 cells with girradiation that up-regulated the total and surface expression of
DR5 (Fig. 3B), especially in the presence of KU-55933, further increased levels of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3D). On the other
hand, IKK-NF-nB inhibitor BMS-345541 decreased apoptotic levels after irradiation of melanoma cells (Fig. 3D), correlating with
decreased levels of NF-nB-dependent proapoptotic DR5 after irradiation in the presence of BMS-345541. In contrast to DR5, radiationinduced surface FAS expression in LU1205 cells was not further
increased in the presence of KU-55933 (Fig. 3C).
KU-55933 sensitizes resistant HHMSX melanoma cells to
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Additional experiments showed that
up-regulation of DR5 surface levels and down-regulation of cFLIP
protein levels after irradiation in the presence of KU-55933 (data

not shown) was accompanied by accelerated TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in WM9 melanoma cells. In contrast, TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis of TIG3 normal fibroblasts was substantially lower
(Fig. 4A) based probably on a protective mechanism for TRAILmediated apoptosis in normal cells. We used the similar treatment
for up-regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in resistant HHMSX
melanoma cells (Fig. 4A). Besides low surface expression of DR5
(Fig. 1D), these cells were characterized by notably suppressed
mitochondrial function (24). KU-55933 alone, but not TRAIL,
caused only modest down-regulation of cFLIP-L levels in these cells
(Fig. 4B). The sequential treatment of these cells initially with
a combination of KU-55933 and g-radiation that up-regulated
DR5 surface levels (Fig. 4B) and then with recombinant TRAIL

ATM suppression by shRNA. We used pRetroSuper constructs
expressing ATM1 and ATM3 shRNA for stable suppression of ATM
and GFP shRNA as a mock control (20) in melanoma cells. After
selection in the presence of puromycin, LU1205 mass cultures
expressing ATM1, ATM3, and GFP shRNA were obtained. ATM3
and especially ATM1 shRNA were effective in the suppression of
total ATM levels. ATM1 shRNA caused f75% decrease in total
ATM protein levels of LU1205 cells (Fig. 4C). ATM down-regulation
was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of G2-M

culture in comparison with the percentage in the irradiated control
culture (18-34%; data not shown). Furthermore, we observed in

ATM-deficient cells a partial suppression of the basal cFLIP-L, but
not XIAP, protein levels and a notable up-regulation of DR5 surface expression, which did not further increase after g-irradiation
(Fig. 4D). TRAIL-induced apoptosis was maximal in LU1205/ATM1
cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4D). Results obtained
with suppression of ATM expression by specific shRNA generally
confirmed our data based on an inhibition of ATM activity by
its inhibitor KU-55933 (see Fig. 3). However, certain differences
between these two approaches have also been observed. Irradiation had no additional effect on DR5 surface expression in ATMdeficient cells compared with untreated ATM-deficient cells with
already increased DR5 expression (Fig. 4D), whereas irradiated
and KU-55933-treated cells showed higher DR5 expression than
KU-55933-treated nonirradiated cells (Fig. 4A). Consequently, there
was no additional increase in levels of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis

in ATM-deficient irradiated cells compared with already high levels
of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in nonirradiated ATM-deficient cells
(Fig. 4D). Such differences are probably results of a substantial
change in the basal characteristics of ATM-deficient cells. However,
the critical feature, pronounced up-regulation of TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in melanoma cells, was observed for both approaches.
Role of STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation in ATMdependent regulation of DR5 expression. Several signaling pathways and the corresponding transcription factors may be involved
in the regulation of radiation-induced DR5 expression: ATM-Chk2p53, IKK-NF-nB, MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)Elk1, MKK4/7-JNK-cJun, and JAK2-STAT3. Because suppression of
p53 and NF-nB activities by KU-55933 was not accompanied by a
decrease in the DR5 surface expression, it might indicate the
existence of an alternative ATM-dependent signaling pathway,

Inhibition of ATM Enhances TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis

characterized by the activation of a transcription factor that could
negatively control DR5 expression.
We used specific inhibitors of signaling pathways to further
resolve the mechanism of regulation of DR5 expression. Similarly
to the inhibitor of IKK-NF-nB (Fig. 3B), JNK inhibitor SP600125
(10 Amol/L) blocked an increase in DR5 surface expression (Fig. 5A
and B). As expected, this inhibitor down-regulated c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 5C) after g-irradiation of LU1205 cells. These
results indicated a positive role of JNK in the regulation of radiationinduced DR5 expression (Fig. 5A and B) that further confirmed
observations on the significance of JNK-SP1 for enhancing expression of DR5 (33). U0126 (10 Amol/L), a MEK-ERK inhibitor, substantially decreased DR5 surface expression in both nonirradiated
and irradiated cells (Fig. 5A and B). This inhibitor suppressed
constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation in LU1205 cells, whereas
KU-55933 had no effects (Fig. 5C). Only AG490 (50 Amol/L), a
JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor, resembled the positive effects of KU-55933 on
DR5 levels in melanoma cells (Fig. 5A and B). STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation mediated by JAK2 is involved in STAT3 dimerization
and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus and interaction
with genomic DNA (34). Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 further increases STAT3 transacting functions in the gene promoters.
KU-55933 treatment, as expected, suppressed radiation-induced
ATM activation and notably reduced basal and radiation-induced
levels of both STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
A luciferase assay confirmed the summary negative effects of
KU-55933 on STAT3-dependent reporter activity in g-irradiated
cells that was quite similar to STAT3-Luc inhibition by AG490
(Fig. 5D). A role of ATM, as well as the mitogen-activated protein
kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in Ser727
phosphorylation of STAT3, was previously established (6, 34),
whereas the ATM-dependent pathway that affects tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is currently unknown. Interestingly, KU-55933
also partially suppressed JNK1 but not p38 phosphorylation, which
might be a reason for the decrease in Ser727 phosphorylation of
STAT3 via JNK1 (Fig. 5C). Our data indicated an up-regulation of
DR5 total and surface expression upon suppression of phosphoTyr705- and phospho-Ser727-dependent STAT3 functions, which
was consistent with suggestion on STAT3 to be a negative regulator
of DR5 expression and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (35, 36). To
further confirm a negative regulation of DR5 expression by STAT3,
we mutated the STAT3-binding site in the DR5 promoter using
a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Stratagene). This
resulted in pronounced up-regulation of the DR5-luciferase activity
before and after g-irradiation, whereas mutations in the intronic
NF-nB-binding site resulted in a down-regulation of DR5-luciferase
activity (31) in melanoma cells (Fig. 5D).
Dominant-negative STAT3B substantially increased DR5
surface expression on melanoma cells both in cell culture
and in vivo. Next, we used previously established melanoma lines
LU1205 stably transfected with the empty vector (pBabe-puro)
or by STAT3h, a dominant-negative form of STAT3 with the
55-amino acid COOH-terminal deletion, including Ser727, which
strongly suppressed STAT3 transcriptional activity (37, 38).
STAT3h overexpression moderately decreased cell growth in
culture and strongly increased surface expression of DR5 in both
nontreated and irradiated LU1205 melanoma cells (Fig. 6A and B).
Furthermore, LU1205/STAT3h cells contained a decreased basal
level of cFLIP-L and cFLIP-S compared with the control cells
(Fig. 6A). Taken together, this correlated with increased TRAILmediated apoptosis in STAT3h-transfected LU1205 cells (Fig. 6C).

www.aacrjournals.org

We next examined whether STAT3h-dependent up-regulation of the
DR5 surface expression was maintained in vivo. Interestingly, the
LU1205-STAT3h melanoma xenotransplant exhibited a dramatic
decrease in tumor volume compared with the control LU1205-puro
transplant in athymic nude mice 3 weeks after injection of melanoma
cells (Fig. 6D). The DR5 surface expression was maintained notably
higher in LU1205-STAT3h tumor cells in vivo than in the control
LU1205-puro tumors (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data confirmed
that suppression of ATM-dependent STAT3 activation enhanced
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of surface DR5
expression, whereas suppression of both STAT3 and NF-nB appeared
to be involved in down-regulation of cFLIP (see Figs. 2B, 3A, and 6A)
accompanied by an additional increase in apoptotic levels.
In general, the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 affected TRAILmediated apoptosis more strongly than the JAK2 inhibitor,
AG490, or overexpression of STAT3h (Fig. 6C). Finally, LY294002
(50 Amol/L), a universal inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases, including ATM,
induced the strongest acceleration of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
in melanoma cells (Fig. 6C), indicating for a role of other members
of this family in suppression of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. A combination of KU-55933 and LY294002 did not additionally increase
levels of TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with apoptosis in the
presence of LY294002 alone. Hence, the ATM pathway regulated
antiapoptotic function in melanoma cells that substantially suppressed TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Discussion
A role for the suppression of ATM activity in sensitizing cancer
cells to radiation-induced death was already described (39, 40).
Consequently, targeted cancer therapy based on the inhibition
of DNA strand break repair is currently being undertaken in
numerous clinical trials (41). As most metastatic melanomas are
radioresistant, ionizing radiation alone is rarely used for treatment
of this disease. We investigated in the present study an alternative
approach involving a combined treatment of g-irradiation and an
inhibitor of ATM kinase followed by induction of recombinant
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Using inhibition of ATM activity by
KU-55933 or a partial suppression of ATM expression by specific
ATM shRNA stably transfected in melanoma cells, we observed a
substantial up-regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
A previous report described ATM-dependent activation of STAT3
transcriptional activity (6) that might negatively control DR5 gene
expression, which we confirmed in the present study. Consequently,
partial reduction of Ser727 and Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3
by KU-55933 reversed DR5 down-regulation, which was directed by
ATM. A role for ATM, mammalian target of rapamycin, and the
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 was described previously (6, 34), whereas an ATMdependent signaling pathway resulting in up-regulation of tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT3 needs to be investigated. Further, dominant-negative STAT3h with deleted Ser727 was effective in several
actions, such as suppression of melanoma xenotransplant growth,
probably via inhibition of STAT3-dependent expression of cyclin D1
(42), and an up-regulation of DR5 and FAS (37) surface expression
in cell culture and in vivo. A substantial inhibition of melanoma
xenotransplant growth by STAT3h might also indicate a role for
DR5- and FAS-mediated apoptosis in this process.
A negative role for STAT3 was shown previously for the
regulation of FAS (37) and p53 (43) transcription, whereas STAT3,

together with NF-nB, was involved in the positive control of
antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and cFLIP/CFLAR gene expression (44–47).
Coordinated up-regulation of DR5 expression (through suppression of ATM-STAT3 activity) and down-regulation of cFLIP protein
levels (through suppression of ATM-NF-nB- and ATM-STAT3dependent expression) may represent an efficient combination
treatment that can dramatically accelerate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in several cancer cell systems (26, 46).
One of the critical factors that determine the efficacy of
anticancer therapy is the ability to selectively kill cancer cells
while minimally affecting normal cells. In this context, TRAIL via
interaction with the correspondent TRAIL-R1/R2 on the surface
of cancer cells may induce a fatal signaling cascade in cancer
cells and has only minimal cytotoxic effects in normal cells (10).
There have been numerous attempts to increase sensitivity of
cancer cells to TRAIL using different types of combined treatment.
Based on the results of the present study, combined treatment with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

g-irradiation and an ATM inhibitor that is followed by treatment
with exogenous TRAIL represents a potentially effective approach
for cancer cell killing. Our findings provide a basis for further
investigation of TRAIL-mediated target treatment to overcome
apoptotic resistance of metastatic melanomas.
