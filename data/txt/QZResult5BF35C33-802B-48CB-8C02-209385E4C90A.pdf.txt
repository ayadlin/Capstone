BACKGROUND: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2 trial, the authors evaluated the vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor inhibitor axitinib, bevacizumab, or both in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC). METHODS: Patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomized 1:1:1 to receive continuous axitinib 5 mg twice
daily, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or axitinib 5 mg twice daily plus bevacizumab 2 mg/kg every 2 weeks, each in combination with modified 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-6). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR).
RESULTS: In all, 126 patients were enrolled from August 2007 to September 2008. The ORR was numerically inferior in the axitinib
arm (n 5 42) versus the bevacizumab arm (n 5 43; 28.6% vs 48.8%; 1-sided P 5.97). Progression-free survival (PFS) (11.0 months vs
15.9 months; 1-sided P 5.57) and overall survival (OS) (18.1 months vs 21.6 months; 1-sided P 5.69) also were numerically inferior in the
axitinib arm. Similarly, efficacy endpoints for the axitinib/bevacizumab arm (n 5 41) were numerically inferior (ORR, 39%; PFS, 12.5
months; OS, 19.7 months). The patients who received axitinib had fewer treatment cycles compared with other arms. Common allgrade adverse events across all 3 treatment arms were fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea (all 49%). Hypertension and headache were
more frequent in the patients who received axitinib. Patients in the bevacizumab arm had the longest treatment exposures and the
highest rates of peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the addition of continuous axitinib nor the axitinib/bevacizumab
combination to FOLFOX-6 improved ORR, PFS, or OS compared with bevacizumab as first-line treatment of mCRC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United
States.1 The prognosis is poor for patients who present with distant metastases (approximately 20% of those diagnosed),
in whom the 5-year survival rate is approximately 12%.1 Standard first-line chemotherapy for metastatic CRC (mCRC)
consists of infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus
irinotecan (FOLFIRI).2 First-line treatment with either regimen, followed by transfer to the alternate regimen upon progression, is associated with a median survival of 20.6 to 21.5 months.3
The addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)
ligand, to chemotherapy reportedly prolongs the survival of patients with previously untreated mCRC compared with placebo plus chemotherapy.4 In a pivotal phase 3 study, bevacizumab added to irinotecan, bolus fluorouracil, and leucovorin
(IFL) significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) (10.6 months vs 6.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.54;
P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (20.3 months vs 15.6 months; HR 0.66; P < .001) compared with IFL plus placebo.4
Subsequently, it was shown that bevacizumab numerically improved survival when added to first-line FOLFIRI5,6 or

include hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhage, impaired
surgical wound healing, infusion-related hypersensitivity
reactions, thromboembolism, and gastrointestinal
perforation.8,9
Axitinib is a potent and selective second-generation
inhibitor of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and
VEGFR3 that blocks the VEGFRs at subnanomolar drug
concentrations with minimal inhibition of other targets.10
Axitinib is approved in the United States for the treatment
of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of 1 prior
systemic therapy,11 having demonstrated superior efficacy
compared with sorafenib in the second-line setting.12
Simultaneous inhibition of the VEGF-A ligand and the
VEGFRs may result in additive antitumor activity when
axitinib is used in combination with bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy.
In a phase 1 study, axitinib plus FOLFOX with or
without bevacizumab was feasible and was devoid of pharmacokinetic interactions in patients with previously
treated solid tumors, including mCRC.13 Consequently,
we conducted the current randomized phase 2 study to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of axitinib in combination
with the modified FOLFOX-6 regimen (referred to
herein as FOLFOX) with or without bevacizumab in
patients with previously untreated mCRC. The dosage of
bevacizumab in combination with axitinib was chosen
based on the results of the phase 1 study of axitinib in
combination with chemotherapy for solid tumors, including mCRC.13 The primary endpoint was the objective
response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients
who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial
response (PR). Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response, PFS, and OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2
study conducted in the United States. A web-based, centralized randomization system was used to assign patients
in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive axitinib plus FOLFOX (axitinib
arm), bevacizumab plus FOLFOX (bevacizumab arm), or
combined axitinib and bevacizumab plus FOLFOX (axitinib plus bevacizumab arm). Randomization, in block sizes
of 3 patients, was stratified according to the receipt of
prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no) and prior pelvic
irradiation (yes vs no).
This study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on
2556

Harmonization Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice,
the study protocol, and applicable local regulatory
requirements and laws. Study protocol, amendments, and
informed consent forms were approved by an institutional
review board/independent ethics committee. Written
informed consent was provided by all participants before
entering the study. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as national clinical trial 00460603
(NCT00460603).
Patients

Eligible adult patients (aged 18 years) had previously
untreated, histologically or cytologically documented,
locally advanced CRC or mCRC. Patients who had
received previous adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible if
the last dose of adjuvant therapy was >12 months before
enrollment. Patients also were required to have measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0)14; an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; life expectancy 12 weeks; no evidence of preexisting uncontrolled hypertension, ie, blood pressure
(BP) >140/90 mm Hg (antihypertensive medications
were permitted); and adequate liver function, renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 3 upper limit of normal and
500 mg urinary protein/24 hours or dipstick <21),
and hematologic/bone marrow function (hemoglobin
9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count 1500/mm3, platelet
count 100,000/mm3).
Key exclusion criteria included second malignancy;
metastases in the central nervous system; prior irradiation
to 25% of the bone marrow; congestive heart failure or
recent cardiovascular event; use of or anticipated need for
known cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (food or
drugs) or drugs that induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2; recent
significant bleeding; clinically significant gastrointestinal
abnormalities; known dihydropyridine dehydrogenase
deficiency; or hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin, 5-FU, leucovorin, or recombinant human antibodies.
Drug Administration

Axitinib was administered orally with food at a starting
dosage of 5 mg twice daily before administration of
FOLFOX. After cycle 1, titration of the axitinib dose to 7
mg twice daily, and then up to 10 mg twice daily, was
permitted if patients experienced no axitinib-related
adverse events (AEs) of greater severity than Common
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)15 grade 2
for consecutive 2-week periods, if their BP was
150/90 mm Hg, and if they were not receiving

antihypertensive medication. Axitinib was continued at
the same 5-mg twice daily dosage if a patient developed a
grade 1 or 2 AE, but it was reduced to 3 mg twice daily
and then to 2 mg twice daily, if necessary, in patients who
developed grade 3 nonhematologic AEs or had systolic BP
>150 mm Hg or diastolic BP >100 mm Hg while receiving maximal antihypertensive therapy. Axitinib was interrupted in patients who had grade 4 nonhematologic AEs,
2 readings of systolic BP >160 mm Hg or diastolic BP
>105 mm Hg, or 2 g protein/24 hours; and
axitinib was resumed at 1 dose level lower when
AEs improved to grade 2, BP <150/100 mm Hg, or
<2 g protein/24 hours.
Bevacizumab was administered intravenously at a
dose of 5 mg/kg (bevacizumab arm) or 2 mg/kg (axitinib
plus bevacizumab arm) once every 2 weeks immediately
before chemotherapy or before axitinib for patients who
were randomized to the combination arm. The initial
dose of bevacizumab was administered as a 90-minute
infusion; if no infusion-associated AEs occurred, then the
second dose was administered as a 60-minute
infusion, and each subsequent dose was administered as a
30-minute infusion. Bevacizumab was interrupted in
patients with 2 g protein/24 hours or if they developed
persistent or symptomatic hypertension. Bevacizumab
was discontinued in patients who developed nephrotic
syndrome, grade 4 hypertension, serious bleeding or
thromboembolic events, or an infusion-related severe
hypersensitivity reaction.
FOLFOX, administered in 2-week cycles, consisted
of intravenous oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and intravenous leucovorin 400 mg/m2 infused concurrently over 120
minutes (through separate lines), followed by intravenous
5-FU 400 mg/m2 as a bolus injection, then 2400 mg/m2
as a continuous intravenous infusion over 46 to 48 hours.
Study treatment was continued until patients developed
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose modifications of both axitinib and bevacizumab in the axitinib
plus bevacizumab arm were at the discretion of the investigators, according to their clinical judgment.
Assessments

Tumors were assessed for response according to RECIST
version 1.014 by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and every 6 weeks; images were
evaluated locally and were not centrally collected. To
meet the criteria for stable disease, a minimum of 12
weeks was required for follow-up scans; patients who had
stable disease for <12 weeks were classified as having an
indeterminate response. Survival was monitored at least
Cancer

every 3 months after discontinuation of study treatment
until 1 year after randomization of the last patient.
Safety assessments included monitoring of AEs, physical
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. The severity of
AEs was graded according to CTCAE version 3.0.15 BP
was measured at each clinic visit and twice daily by
patients prior to axitinib dosing.
Statistical Analysis

Approximately 41 randomized patients per arm
(N 5 123) were required to determine whether the true
response rate was 40% with an a value .10 versus a true
response rate of 60% with a power of .90. Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat population (all
randomized patients). Exact 2-sided 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for the response rate of each treatment arm
were calculated using a method based on the F distribution. PFS, OS, and duration of response were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method.16 Inferential statistics
were calculated for the axitinib arm and the axitinib plus
bevacizumab arm versus the bevacizumab arm, but not for
the axitinib arm versus the axitinib plus bevacizumab arm.
All patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication were included in the safety analysis.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 126 patients were randomized between August
2007 and September 2008 to receive, in addition to
FOLFOX, axitinib (n 5 42), bevacizumab (n 5 43), or
axitinib plus bevacizumab (n 5 41) (Fig. 1). Of these, 123
patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment (axitinib, n 5 39; bevacizumab, n 5 43; axitinib plus bevacizumab, n 5 41). Three patients in the axitinib arm were
randomized but were not treated at the discretion of the
investigator or patient. Patient demographics and baseline
characteristics were generally similar among the study
arms (Table 1).
Treatment Exposure

Patients in the axitinib arm received fewer FOLFOX
treatment cycles than those in the bevacizumab arm or the
axitinib plus bevacizumab arm (Table 2). The median
daily dose of axitinib and the median dose per cycle of
bevacizumab were higher in the single-agent treatment
arms than in the combined axitinib plus bevacizumab
arm. In the axitinib arm, 4 patients (10.3%) had a dose titration to axitinib 7 mg twice daily during the study; in
the axitinib plus bevacizumab arm, 4 patients (9.8%) had
a dose titration to axitinib 7 mg twice daily, and 1 patient

Objective responses occurred in 28.6% of axitinib-treated
patients (1-sided P 5 .97 vs bevacizumab), 48.8% of bevacizumab-treated patients, and 39% of axitinib plus bevacizumab-treated
patients (1-sided
P 5 .82 vs
bevacizumab) (Table 3). A CR was attained in 1 patient
who was receiving axitinib and in 2 patients who were
receiving bevacizumab. The median PFS was 11.0 months
in patients receiving axitinib (1-sided P 5 .57 vs bevacizumab) compared with 15.9 months in patients receiving
bevacizumab, and 12.5 months in those receiving axitinib
plus bevacizumab (1-sided P 5 .87 vs bevacizumab) (Table 3, Fig. 2a). The median OS was 18.1 months in
patients receiving axitinib (1-sided P 5 .69 vs bevacizumab) compared with 21.6 months in patients receiving
bevacizumab and 19.7 months (1-sided P 5 .41 vs bevacizumab) in patients receiving axitinib plus bevacizumab
(Table 3, Fig. 2b).

(diarrhea, nausea, constipation, vomiting), fatigue, hypertension, and neutropenia (Table 4). Diarrhea, hypertension, insomnia, and dysphonia were less common in
bevacizumab-treated patients (>10% difference between
treatment arms); whereas neutropenia, peripheral
neuropathy, abdominal pain, pyrexia, and depression
were more common in that group. Hypothyroidism was
reported in 17.9% of axitinib-treated patients compared
with 4.7% of bevacizumab-treated patients and 17.1% of
axitinib plus bevacizumab-treated patients; no grade 3
hypothyroidism was reported. In the axitinib arm, compared with the bevacizumab arm, patients had higher incidences of grade 3 hypertension, thrombocytopenia,
nausea, and asthenia. Patients in the bevacizumab arm
had a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy than
those treated with axitinib (51.2% vs 30.8%; all grades),
possibly attributable to longer oxaliplatin treatment exposure. In addition, there were lower rates of grade 3 AEs
with axitinib versus bevacizumab for diarrhea, vomiting,
and dyspnea. Many AEs occurred at higher incidence in
patients receiving axitinib plus bevacizumab than in those
receiving either axitinib or bevacizumab as single agents.
No cases of gastrointestinal perforation were reported in
this study. More patients (56.1% [36.6% considered
treatment-related]) experienced serious AEs in the axitinib
plus bevacizumab arm than in either of the other 2 arms
2560

(axitinib arm, 38.5% [28.2% treatment-related]; bevacizumab arm, 39.5% [30.2% treatment-related]).
Approximately twice as many patients discontinued
axitinib because of AEs (41%) than those who discontinued bevacizumab because of AEs (20.9%). There were no
predominant toxicities leading to axitinib or bevacizumab
discontinuation. In the axitinib arm, AEs leading to axitinib discontinuation were hypertension and pulmonary
embolism (n 5 2 each) and asthenia/pulmonary embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, deep
vein thrombosis, diarrhea, disease progression/rectal abscess, epistaxis, fatigue, headache, peripheral neuropathy,
sepsis, and unspecified reason (n 5 1 each). In the bevacizumab arm, AEs leading to bevacizumab discontinuation
were asthenia, device-related infection, pharyngolaryngeal
dysesthesia, fatigue, jugular vein thrombosis, peripheral
neuropathy, prostate cancer, proteinuria, and hemorrhagic shock (n 5 1 each). Because bevacizumab dose
reduction was not specified in the protocol, axitinib dose
reductions because of treatment-related AEs were more
frequent than bevacizumab dose reductions (axitinib arm,
28.2%; bevacizumab arm, 11.6%), whereas axitinib dose
interruptions because of treatment-related AEs were less
common than bevacizumab dose interruptions (axitinib
arm, 46.2%; bevacizumab arm, 62.8%), as indicated in
Table 5.

DISCUSSION
In this randomized phase 2 study, axitinib plus modified
FOLFOX-6 (ie, FOLFOX) did not improve efficacy outcomes compared with bevacizumab plus FOLFOX in
patients with previously untreated mCRC (1-sided
P 5 .97). ORR and median PFS and OS were numerically
lower in the axitinib arm than in the bevacizumab arm. It
is noteworthy that the median PFS with bevacizumab plus
FOLFOX in the current study (15.9 months) was longer
compared with that achieved using combinations of bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy
reported in prior phase 3 studies in the first-line setting
(9.4 months and 10.3 months, respectively).7,17 It is disappointing to report that the combination of axitinib plus
bevacizumab also failed to improve ORR or survival compared with bevacizumab.

Efficacy endpoints and the safety profile of the bevacizumab arm in the current study are consistent with historic
outcomes of bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatinbased7 or irinotecan-based chemotherapy for the first-line
treatment of mCRC.4,18 The addition of axitinib, or of the
combined antiangiogenic agents (axitinib plus bevacizumab), to FOLFOX appeared to be somewhat less tolerable
than bevacizumab plus FOLFOX, with higher rates of
hypertension, headache, and hypothyroidism. The
increased rate of peripheral neuropathy in the bevacizumab
arm may have been related to longer treatment duration
and, thus, higher cumulative oxaliplatin exposure.
In this study, the median duration of treatment with
axitinib plus FOLFOX was less than half that of bevacizumab plus FOLFOX, which may partially explain the differences in response rates and survival endpoints between

the treatment arms. It is likely that the tolerability issues
outlined above contributed to the shorter treatment duration with axitinib plus FOLFOX; however, the rates of
some of the most troublesome side effects of fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were similar across all 3 treatment arms.
Furthermore, only 7% of patients of who received axitinib
plus FOLFOX had progressive disease as their best overall
response. This suggests that our study also may have been
limited by its open-label treatment design. Physician and/
or patient bias may have contributed to the lower duration
of exposure with axitinib and increased scrutiny of toxicities, and randomization to the arm without bevacizumab
could have resulted in early discontinuation for patients
with stable disease or limited toxicity.
Recently, it was demonstrated that the oral VEGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib improved OS and
PFS compared with placebo in patients with advanced
CRC who had received previous treatment with oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy.19 Although those
data support the utility of VEGFR inhibitors as monotherapy in the refractory setting, attempts at combining
them with chemotherapy have been unsuccessful to date.
In the HORIZON III study, there were no significant differences in PFS, OS, or ORR between cediranib and bevacizumab in patients who also received FOLFOX.17
Similarly, a global phase 3 study of sunitinib plus
FOLFIRI compared with placebo plus FOLFIRI for the
first-line treatment of mCRC was stopped earlier than
planned in June 2009, when the data monitoring committee established that sunitinib plus FOLFIRI did not
significantly improve PFS, which was the primary study
endpoint.20 In the randomized phase 3 CONFIRM-1
2562

study, vatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584) plus FOLFOX-4
did not improve PFS, OS, or ORR compared with placebo plus FOLFOX-4 in 1168 patients with previously
untreated mCRC.21
Sunitinib and cediranib are multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors with in vivo activity against other nonVEGFR kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (sunitinib, cediranib), stem-cell factor receptor
(sunitinib, cediranib), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic
factor receptor (sunitinib), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3
(sunitinib), and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor
(sunitinib).22,23 In the phase 3 studies described
above,17,21 dose modifications were more frequent in the
VEGFR arm; and, subsequently, exposures to the parent
cytotoxic chemotherapy were decreased. In our study, in
both the axitinib arm and the axitinib plus bevacizumab
arm, over half of patients required dose reductions at
some point during treatment. Although axitinib is a
highly selective VEGFR inhibitor with less off-target kinase activity compared with other multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, our study adds to the body of evidence
that adding this class of agents to FOLFOX creates tolerability issues and does not appear to improve tumor
response or prolong survival compared with bevacizumab
in the first-line treatment of mCRC.
It seemed advantageous that simultaneous inhibition of both the VEGF ligand and its receptor could provide more profound pathway inhibition, which hopefully
would lead to improved clinical outcomes. However, the
combination of axitinib and bevacizumab in our study
did not appear to increase efficacy compared with bevacizumab alone in previously untreated patients receiving
FOLFOX. There are several possible explanations for this,
including the reduced dosage of bevacizumab in the axitinib plus bevacizumab arm (2 mg/kg vs 5 mg/kg bevacizumab alone); in the phase 1b study of this combination
with FOLFOX, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg with axitinib 5 mg
twice daily was deemed intolerable because of the doselimiting toxicity of hypertension.13 Even at the 2 mg/kg
dose of bevacizumab plus axitinib 5 mg twice daily with
FOLFOX in our study, the treatment exposures were
shorter than with bevacizumab plus FOLFOX.
In summary, continuous administration of axitinib
plus FOLFOX and the combination of axitinib plus bevacizumab plus FOLFOX appears to be somewhat less tolerable, with higher incidence of hypertension, headache,
and hypothyroidism, than treatment with bevacizumab
plus FOLFOX. It is plausible that tolerability in combination with chemotherapy may be improved when axitinib
is administered on an intermittent schedule. The longest

duration of treatment was observed in the bevacizumab
arm, which may have contributed to the lower response
rate in the axitinib arm. The lack of improvement in PFS
and OS with axitinib compared with bevacizumab is consistent with other studies of VEGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in combination with oxaliplatin-based regimens in the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.
Unfortunately, simultaneous inhibition of the VEGFR
and the VEGF ligand with the combination of axitinib
and bevacizumab plus FOLFOX also did not improve
ORR, PFS, or OS as compared with bevacizumab plus
FOLFOX.
