Abstract

Author Manuscript

Protein translation is inhibited by the unfolded protein response (UPR)-induced eIF-2α
phosphorylation to protect against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, we found
additional inhibition of protein translation due to diminished mTORC1 activity in ER-stressed
multiple myeloma (MM) cells. However, c-myc protein levels and myc translation was
maintained. To ascertain how c-myc was maintained, we studied myc IRES function which does
not require mTORC1 activity. Myc IRES activity was upregulated in MM cells during ER stress
induced by thapsigargin, tunicamycin or the myeloma therapeutic bortezomib. IRES activity was
dependent upon upstream MAPK and MNK1 signaling. A screen identified hnRNP A1 (A1) and
RPS 25 as IRES-binding trans factors required for ER stress-activated activity. A1 associated with
RPS25 during ER stress and this was prevented by a MNK inhibitor. In a proof of principle, we
identified a compound that prevented binding of A1 to the myc IRES and specifically inhibited
myc IRES activity in MM cells. This compound, when used alone, was not cytotoxic nor did it
inhibit myc translation or protein expression. However, when combined with ER stress inducers,
especially bortezomib, a remarkable synergistic cytotoxicity ensued with associated inhibition of
myc translation and expression. These results underscore the potential for targeting A1-mediated
myc IRES activity in MM cells during ER stress.

INTRODUCTION
Regulation of protein translation is important in multiple myeloma (MM) because a high
rate of Ig production places the malignant cell at risk for ER stress-induced death. In
addition to efficient proteasome function, expanded ER membrane development and a

heightened UPR mechanism (1, 2), MM cells also protect against ER stress by repressing
generalized TORC1 activity to limit unnecessary protein translation. For example, MM cells
transcriptionally upregulate ARK5 and DEPTOR (3, 4), two proteins that suppress TORC1
(4, 5) function and global cap-dependent translation. However, to maintain tumor cell
viability during ER stress, translation of key proteins must continue. Our prior work (6, 7)
suggested the possibility that this translation can occur through cap-independent, IRES
(internal ribosome entry site)-dependent mechanisms. IRES-dependent translation does not
require mTOR activity (ie., no risk of enhanced global translation) and is independent of
mRNA cap binding to the eIF-4F initiation complex. It is mediated by direct binding of an
IRES sequence in the mRNA’s 5′UTR to the ribosome, facilitated by RNA binding proteins
termed ITAFs (IRES-trans-acting factors).

A protein that needs to be continuously expressed for MM cell proliferation and survival is
c-myc. C-myc expression is a key factor in MM progression (8) and MM cells appear to be
addicted to c-myc expression (9). The c-myc RNA contains a well-characterized IRES (10)
and we have previously reported (6,7) on myc IRES function in MM cells responding to
IL-6 or mTOR inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

In keeping with the key regulatory role of protein translation, we have found a rapid
inhibition of mTORC1 function occurring in ER-stress in MM cells (see results, below).
This effect, in addition to the negative effect of UPR-induced eIF-2α phosphorylation (2),
should prevent cap-dependent translation and leave IRES activity as the only fail-safe
mechanism for protein translation. We, thus, investigated whether myc IRES function is an
important determinant of maintained myc expression and MM cell fate during ER stress.
Our results confirm this hypothesis and suggest IRES function could be a promising
therapeutic target. Indeed, we also demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a selective
inhibitor of myc IRES function during enhanced ER stress in MM cells.

RESULTS
ER stress inhibits mTORC1 function in MM cells

Author Manuscript

Initial experiments investigated effects of ER stress on mTORC1. 8226, MM1.S, and
OPM-2 MM lines were exposed to tunicamycin (TU), thapsigargin (TH) or clinically
relevant concentrations of bortezomib (BORT, 2–10nM) for 7 hrs followed by immunoblot
assay. P70 and 4EBP-1 are substrates of mTORC1 and S6 is a substrate of p70. As shown in
figs 1A–F, exposure of all three lines to all three drugs resulted in depressed mTORC1
function identified by diminished phosphorylation of p70 and S6. At this early time point (7
hrs) there was no effect of any of the ER stress inducers on percent viability or viable cell
recovery. Additional immunoblots (not shown) confirmed the generation of ER stress,
demonstrated by enhanced phosphorylation of IRE-1 and induction of CHOP expression.
Experiments in ANBL-6 MM cells (suppl fig 1) show similar effects on p70 and S6
phosphorylation. ER stress inducers also down-regulated 4EBP-1 phosphorylation. In 8226,
tunicamycin/thapsigargin-treated MM1.S cells and bortezomib-treated OPM-2 cells, this
was shown with use of a phospho-specific antibody (suppl fig 2A). In bortezomib-treated
MM1.S and tunicamycin/thapsigargin-treated OPM-2 cells, use of an antibody detecting
total 4EBP-1 identified 3 bands representing differential phosphorylation of 4EBP-1. The γ

hyperphosphorylated band predominates in control cells and, following exposure to ER
inducers, the hypophosphorylated α band predominates (suppl fig 2A).
We also studied four separate CD138-selected 1° MM samples. A 6 hr exposure of these 1°
cells to tunicamycin (Tu at 25 uM) or thapsigargin (TH, 1 uM) also demonstrated inhibited
phosphorylation of p70 (fig 1G). There was no detected cell cytotoxicity at this early time
(data not shown).

The inhibition of mTORC1 should result in depressed cap-dependent translation. Assays for
lambda Ig expression in 8226 MM cells support this contention. As shown (fig 1H), ER
stress inducers decreased Ig expression by 40–50%. In contrast, c-myc protein expression in
all 3 lines was not decreased by ER stress and the accompanying mTORC inhibition (figs
1A–F). In some of these immunoblots there are more than one distinct myc protein bands
detected. This is due to the fact that there are two separate species expressed from either the
P1 or P2 promoters (generating p67 or p64 proteins (11)). Both these proteins contain exon
3 and could be detected by our anti-myc antibody which is specific for a peptide fragment of
exon 3. Additional isoforms of myc are also produced by alternative splicing ((12), see
below figure 6). The intermittent detection of these additional myc protein species can be a
function of the duration of gel electrophoresis. Although fig 1D suggests a slight decrease in
myc expression following exposure of MM1.S cells to the lowest concentration of
bortezomib (2nM), when we quantified c-myc expression by densitometric analysis of all
myc bands between p64 and p67 in four separate experiments, it is clear that, although
markedly inhibiting TORC1 activity (p70 phosphorylation), bortezomib had no inhibitory
effect on c-myc expression at all concentrations (suppl fig 2B). The finding of an actual
increase in c-myc protein expression in tunicamycin and thapsigargin-treated 8226 cells (fig
1A) may be related to an early myc RNA induction (see Discussion).
In addition to the cell line experiments, reprobing three of the four primary samples also
demonstrated no inhibition of c-myc protein expression during ER stress (fig 1G).
Collectively, these results confirm that enhanced ER stress induction in MM cells causes
rapid depression of mTORC1 but c-myc protein expression is maintained.
Myc IRES activity is stimulated during ER stress

Author Manuscript

We first tested if increases in steady state myc RNA could explain maintained myc protein
levels during ER stress. On the contrary, in 8226 cells challenged with bortezomib or
tunicamycin for 7 hrs, instead of an increase there was a moderate decrease in myc RNA
levels (fig 2A). Results in MM1.S cells were similar (suppl fig 3A), without any increases in
steady state myc RNA. This suggests that effects on RNA expression do not play a role in
maintenance of c-myc protein levels during ER stress. However, a caveat to this
interpretation is that an earlier myc RNA induction may have occurred (see Discussion).
Since bortezomib, by preventing proteasome degradation of myc (13), could theoretically
inhibit degradation, we also tested c-myc protein stability in bortezomib-treated MM cells
(fig 2B). As shown, there was an actual decrease in myc protein stability with a T1/2 of 20
mins versus T1/2 of >60 mins in control untreated cells. A similar decrease in T1/2 in
MM1.S cells was seen (suppl fig 3B). Thus, increases in protein stability could not explain
maintained myc protein levels during bortezomib exposure. To specifically assess myc

translational efficiency, we performed a polysome analysis. This assay is based on the
observation that well translated transcripts are associated with polysomes and poorly
translated mRNAs are monosomal. Thus, MM cells were treated, polysomes were separated
from monosomes on sucrose gradients, and associated RNAs were quantified by qt-PCR.
Fig 2C demonstrates an increase in myc translation (white bars) in bortezomib and
tunicamycin-treated cells (ie., increase in polysome-associated RNA). In contrast, translation
of actin is modestly, but significantly (p<0.05) suppressed (black bars), further supporting
the notion that cap-dependent translation is inhibited by the associated mTORC1 depression.
Bortezomib and tunicamycin likewise increased myc translation in MM1.S cells (suppl fig
3C).

The remarkable increase in myc translation during a time when mTORC1 is inhibited was
noteworthy and strongly suggested a stimulation of IRES-dependent translation. To
investigate this, we performed IRES-dependent reporter assays. MM cells were transfected
with either pRF or PRmF dicistronic reporter constructs as shown in fig 2D and treated with
tunicamycin, thapsigargin or bortezomib. The c-myc 5′UTR, containing its IRES, was
subcloned into the intracistronic space between the Renilla and Firefly (FF) luciferase open
reading frames in the pRF vector to yield the pRmF vector. The pRmF reporter’s FF
luciferase translation is driven by the myc 5′UTR and is a reflection of IRES-dependent,
cap-independent translation whereas Renilla expression is due to cap-dependent, IRESindependent translation. Similarly constructed control reporters, where the p27 5′UTR or
Cricket paralysis virus IRES (pCPV) were subcloned into the intracistronic space (not
shown), were also generated. Reporter expression results are normalized for transfection
efficiency by co-transfection with a beta-galactosidase construct. Preliminary experiments
had revealed that β-gal expression was unaffected by tunicamycin, thapsigargin or
bortezomib in short term exposures (suppl fig 4).

Author Manuscript

Fig 2E demonstrates FF expression caused by the myc 5′UTR in untreated 8226 cells was
10× fold increased versus pRF-transfected cells without any effects on Renilla expression.
When exposed to bortezomib, the increase in FF expression due to the myc 5′UTR was now
45× fold increased. It is difficult to see in fig 2E, but bortezomib induced a corresponding
decrease (approx. 40%) in pRmF Renilla expression, attesting to the suppression of capdependent translation in bortezomib-treated cells. Control experiments (fig 2E) in the same
cells demonstrated no significant effect of bortezomib on p27 IRES (pRp27F) or Cricket
paralysis virus IRES (pCPV) activity. Although the Cricket paralysis virus IRES activity was
only 1.7xfold increased over its pRF control, this activity was ablated in a reporter vector
containing an inactive mutated CPV IRES (11)(data not shown). Notably, bortezomib did
not enhance this IRES activity. Figure 2F demonstrates similar stimulatory effects of
thapsigargin or tunicamycin on myc IRES activity. In the absence of ER stress inducers, the
presence of the myc 5′UTR in the intracistronic space in these experiments increased firefly
(FF) luciferase (black bars) to 7× fold versus that of the pRF control vector without effects
on Renilla expression. For thapsigargin, the increase in FF expression because of the myc
5′UTR was now 10, 18 and 22× fold versus that of the pRF vector in cells treated with 0.25,
0.5 and 1 uM respectively Likewise, while exposure to tunicamycin at 3.2 uM only
minimally enhanced FF expression (8.5× fold increase versus that of the pRF vector), 6.4
uM stimulated FF expression to 18× fold versus similarly treated pRF-transfected cells. Both

thapsigargin and tunicamycin induced decreases in Renilla expression in similar fashion to
bortezomib-treated cells. In addition, control experiments with pCPV (fig 2E) show no
stimulatory effect of tunicamycin on Cricket PV IRES activity. Thus, the stimulation of myc
IRES activity following exposure to these agents is relatively specific. This stimulation
likely allows for maintained c-myc protein expression during TORC1 inhibition and
depressed cap-dependent translation following induction of ER stress.

We had previously demonstrated a role for the MNK1 kinase in rapamycin-stimulated myc
IRES activity (7). In addition, both ERK and p38 MAPK pathways have been previously
implicated in myc IRES function (14, 15). As both ERK and p38 can phosphorylate and
activate MNK1, we hypothesized that MAPK pathways, working downstream via MNK1
stimulation, were important for ER stress-induced myc IRES activity. To initially test a role
for MNK1, 8226 or MM1.S MM cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of
tunicamycin or thaspigargin for 7 hrs, followed by immunoblot assay for phosphorylated
MNK1. As shown in fig 3A, MNK1 becomes phosphorylated in both MM lines. A similar
induction of MNK phosphorylation induced by thapsigargin was identified in 2 1° MM
samples (fig 3B). To test the significance of MNK activation, we first used CGP57380, a
MNK inhibitor (7). Fig 3C demonstrates the efficacy of CGP used at 50uM in its ability to
inhibit thapsigargin-induced MNK kinase activity, the latter assayed by immunoblot for
phosphorylation of eIF-4E, a well known MNK1 substrate. This concentration of CGP was
then used in the IRES-dependent reporter assay (fig 3D). IRES activity is reported as a ratio
of firefly (F)/Renilla (R) luciferase expression with comparison to the pRF reporter plasmid
which is arbitrarily set as ‘1’. As shown, the myc 5′UTR in pRmF increases the F/R ratio to
6 × fold over the pRF vector and the addition of thapsigargin, at either 1 or 0.5 uM,
significantly enhances IRES activity to 14 × fold and 10 × fold respectively. However, the
exposure to CGP prevents the thapsigargin-induced IRES stimulation. Similar results were
obtained in thapsigargin and tunicamycin-treated MM1.S cells co-incubated with CGP
(suppl fig 5). Confirmatory experiments utilized shRNA to silence either MNK1 or MNK2
in 8226 cells (fig 3E). Cells were infected with shRNA targeting a scrambled sequence
(SCR) or two separate MNK1 or MNK2 sequences (Cl 1 or Cl 2). The infected cells were
tested for myc IRES activity stimulated by tunicamycin (TU) or thapsigargin (TH) (Fig 3F).
As shown, MNK1 knockdown significantly inhibited the ER stress-induced IRES
stimulation while MNK2 knockdown had little effect.

To next assess MAPK pathway stimulation, we performed immunoblot assay for ERK or
hsp-27 phosphorylation. The latter was chosen as an indicator for p38 MAPK activity. As
shown in fig 4A, exposure of 8226 cells to tunicamycin (12.5 uM, Tu) or thapsigargin at 0.5
or 1 uM (Th 0.5, Th 1) induced both hsp-27 and ERK phosphorylation at 7 hrs. We then
tested a role for MAPK pathways by using inhibitors of ERK (PD98059, 50uM) or p38
(SB202190, 10uM). Fig 4B demonstrates the specificity of the inhibitors and also compares
them to the CGP MNK-inhibitor concentration used in fig 3. In this experiment, thapsigargin
(0.5 uM) clearly stimulated ERK and MNK1 phosphorylation and, more modestly, hsp-27
phosphorylation. The CGP MNK inhibitor, which reduces MNK activity but not MNK
phosphorylation, additionally had no effect on ERK or hsp-27 phosphorylation attesting to
its specificity for MNK activity. Its stimulatory effect on MNK1 phosphorylation may be
due to negative feedback loops responding to inhibited MNK kinase activity. The ERK

PD98059 inhibitor significantly inhibited ERK phosphorylation but not hsp-27
phosphorylation and the p38 SB202190 inhibitor specifically inhibited hsp-27
phosphorylation but not ERK phosphorylation. As expected, both MAPK inhibitors
individually inhibited downstream MNK phosphorylation. The same concentrations of ERK
PD98059 and p38 SB202190 inhibitors were then used in the IRES reporter assay and
compared to the CGP MNK inhibitor. As shown (Fig 4C), each of the three inhibitors was
capable of decreasing thapsigargin-induced myc IRES activity stimulated by either 1 or 0.5
uM thapsigargin. To confirm the importance of the MAPK pathways, we also silenced
ERK1, ERK2 or p38 by shRNA (figs 4D & 4E). Although these MAPK pathways are
critical for long term MM cell survival, viability and cell recovery was unaffected for up to
96 hrs post lentiviral infection. The shRNA targeting ERK1 was specific for ERK1 silencing
although the shRNA targeting ERK2 also demonstrated some off-target silencing of ERK1
as well as ERK2 (Fig 4D). As p38 expression was quite low in SCR-infected control MM
cells, we tested hsp27 phosphorylation as a read-out for p38 expression/activity and, as
shown in fig 4E, p38 shRNA significantly abated hsp27 phosphorylation. The shRNAinfected MM cells were then studied in IRES-dependent reporter assays. As shown in fig 4F,
silencing of either ERK1, ERK2 or p38 resulted in a significant inhibition of ER stressinduced IRES activity. In cells concurrently silenced with ERK1 + ERK2 or with all three
shRNA targeting MAPK pathways, the inhibition of IRES activity was even more
impressive.
Trans-acting factors mediating stimulated IRES activity

To further identify factors involved in the IRES response to ER stress, we performed a
screen based on a recent publication (16) where proteins can be identified which interact
with RNA or assemble into larger RNA-protein complexes within mammalian cells. The
screen depends upon transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR and its GFP signal when an
interaction between the HIV TAT protein and TAR RNA element at the 5′ end of nascent
transcripts enhances elongation (suppl fig 6). In the ‘TAT-hybrid’ screen, the TAR is
replaced by the c-myc IRES RNA and a TAT-fusion library is generated from ER-stressed
8226 MM cells (Thapsigargin, 1 uM for 7 hrs). The MM cell library was cloned into the
TAT fusion plasmid. This TAT-fusion RNA library was then transfected into a U87 reporter
cell line which stably expresses the HIV-LTR-myc-IRES-GFP reporter. Proteins that bind
the c-myc IRES will transcriptionally activate GFP expression. Positive clones with
activated GFP expression are sorted by FACs and DNA obtained for sequencing. The screen
can detect RNA-protein interactions in the context of mammalian cells (ie., advantages over
yeast screening) where important mammalian accessory factors or post-translational
modifying enzymes are available to assemble proper complexes. A strongly positive hit was
hnRNP A1, a known myc ITAF (6). We also identified a non-essential 40S ribosomal
subunit protein RPS25 as a dominant clone isolated from the library screens. To confirm
identification of these two IRES-binding proteins, we performed RNA pull-down
experiments. 8226 myeloma cell extracts were incubated with biotinylated myc IRES RNA
in the sense or anti-sense orientation. Immunoblot was then performed on the proteins
precipitated by these RNAs. We also hypothesized that, as a direct component of the 40S
ribosomal sub-unit, RPS25 was unlikely to directly interact with the c-myc IRES and was a
positive ‘hit’ in the screens as a result of an indirect interaction mediated by hnRNP A1.

Thus, the RNA pull-down assay was also performed in 8226 cells where hnRNP A1 was
silenced by shRNA. Fig 5A demonstrates that the myc IRES in the sense orientation was
capable of precipitating both hnRNP A1 and RPS25 in control 8226 cells (empty vector
(EV)-transfected). Actin was not non-specifically precipitated by the IRES. In contrast,
neither protein was precipitated by myc IRES RNA in the anti-sense orientation. In hnRNP
A1-knocked out (KO) 8226 cells, the myc IRES precipitated considerably less RPS25,
indicating that the IRES-RPS25 interaction was hnRNP A1-dependent.

Author Manuscript

We next silenced either A1 or RPS25 in 8226 cells to test their roles in IRES activity. Fig 5B
demonstrates successful shRNA knockdown utilizing 2 separate target sequences for both
proteins. The shRNA-silenced cells had normal viability (>90%) vs control cells infected
with shRNA targeting scrambled sequences. As shown in fig 5C (top), 8226 cells containing
shRNA to silence RPS25 demonstrated a significantly blunted IRES response (firefly/renilla
ratio) to stimulation with thapsigargin, 0.5uM. In similar fashion, knockdown of hnRNP A1
(bottom) prevented the IRES response to both thapsigargin (Th) and tunicamycin (Tu).
Infection with sh2 was considerably more inhibitory, consistent with its greater ability to
silence A1 expression (fig 5B). A1 knockdown had no effect on p27 IRES activity (fig 5D),
indicating selectivity for the A1-dependent myc IRES. Thus, the TAT-hybrid screen
identified two proteins, hnRNP A1 and RPS25, that interacted with the myc IRES and were
integral for a myc IRES response to ER stress.
To assess whether A1 and RPS25 associated, we performed co-IP experiments in 8226 cells.
As shown in fig 5E, A1 associated with RPS25 when MM cells were challenged with
tunicamycin, thapsigargin or bortezomib. Furthermore, inhibitors of ERK (PD), p38 (SB) or
MNK (CGP) diminish the binding reaction (Fig 5F).

Identification of a myc IRES inhibitor

Author Manuscript

We designed a high throughput yeast three -hybrid screen (suppl fig 7) to identify inhibitors
of the A1-IRES interaction and interrogated the NCI/DTP inhibitor library of approx.
145,000 compounds. Our screen identified a class of compounds which inhibits A1 binding
to the myc IRES with compound ‘11’ as a potential lead compound (Fig 6A). We first
confirmed the ability of compound 11 to inhibit A1/IRES binding in the RNA pull-down
assay. As shown in fig 6B, a marked decrease in binding between A1 and the IRES was
identified when compound 11 was present. Compound 11 also prevents MM cell myc IRES
activity in 8226 cells but had no effect on control p27 IRES activity (fig 6C). Additional
IRESes that are unaffected by compound 11 are BAG-1, XIAP and p53 (suppl fig 8). In
addition, compound 11 also prevents myc IRES activity following challenge with ER stress
inducers like thapsigargin and bortezomib (Fig 6D). As a negative control, there was no
effect on stimulated myc IRES activity resulting from exposure to a similarly sized known
inhibitor of the hepC IRES, benzimidazole-2 (15).
As expected, compound 11 also had no significant effect on myc translation when used
alone (fig 6E) as cap-dependent translation would be unaffected. As previously shown (fig
2), bortezomib, used alone, significantly stimulates myc translation. However, when
bortezomib is combined with compound 11, a significant inhibition of myc translation
occurs (Fig 6E). This is associated with similar effects on protein expression analyzed by

immunoblot (fig 6F). As shown, tunicamycin (Tu), bortezomib (Bort) or compound 11
(inhibitor (Inh)) have little inhibitory effect on myc protein expression when used alone.
However, myc expression is significantly inhibited when compound 11 is combined with
either tunicamycin (Tu) or bortezomib (Bort). The associated ER-stress-induced TORC1
inhibition is again shown as down-regulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Compound 11 had no
significant effects on myc steady state RNA levels (suppl fig 9).
Synergistic anti-MM cytotoxicity

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To first assess a therapeutic strategy targeting A1-mediated IRES function during ER stress,
we tested sensitivity to bortezomib in A1-silenced MM cells. As shown in fig 7A, loss of A1
resulted in a sensitization to bortezomib. These data suggested that compound 11 could be
synergistic with ER stress inducers. When used alone, compound 11 had minimal
cytotoxicity or apoptosis against 8226 and MM1.S cells (figs 7B–D). However, adding these
sub-toxic concentrations to thapsigargin (Fig 7B) or bortezomib (Fig 7C) in 8226 cells
significantly increased cytotoxicity. Similarly, synergistic apoptosis resulted (% apoptosis is
the number above the bars). Median effect/CI analysis confirmed synergy for all
combinations. Remarkably low CI values are shown below the figures for cytotoxicity and
apoptosis. These CI data are plotted against fraction affected in suppl fig 10. In more limited
experiments in terms of concentrations used, studies in MM1.S cells (fig 7D) also
demonstrated a marked interaction of the two therapeutics. Little effect of compound 11 or
thapsigargin used alone was seen while the combination markedly inhibited growth and
induced apoptosis (left panels). Similar results were seen in MM1.S cells challenged with
compound 11 +/− bortezomib (right panels). In addition, 3 1° specimens also demonstrated a
synergistic interaction between compound 11 and bortezomib (Fig 7E). Although the patient
samples were variably sensitive to bortezomib alone (sample #2 was sensitive to 5 nM), all
three samples demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity when non-toxic concentrations of
compound 11 (500 or 1000 nM) were combined with bortezomib.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Restraint of mTORC1 and cap-dependent translation is one mechanism by which MM cells
deal with the enhanced basal ER stress they must face. Indeed, loss-of-function alleles of
mTOR confer susceptibility to plasmacytoma generation in mice (18). When further
challenged with ER stress, our results (fig 1) indicate an additional rapid downregulation of
mTORC1. Cap-dependent translation was depressed, shown by decrease in Ig expression, a
decrease in actin translation (fig 2C) and decrease in Renilla expression in reporter assays. It
is remarkable that, with such depressed mTORC1 function, induced eIF-2α phosphorylation
(2) and inhibited cap dependent translation, myc translation is actually increased and protein
expression is maintained, signifying the importance of myc IRES function.
Although our assays for steady state myc RNA (fig 2A) did not demonstrate any increases
induced by tunicamycin or bortezomib, these assays were performed after 7 hrs. Previous
work (19, 20) demonstrated that thapsigargin and tunicamycin could induce an immediateearly c-myc RNA response in MEF cells. This was somewhat dependent upon PERK
activation in the UPR (19). It is, thus, possible that a PERK-dependent early myc RNA

induction plays a role in the increased myc protein expression seen in the tunicamycin/
thapsigargin-stimulated 8226 cells where the RNA induction had resolved by 7 hrs. There
may also be cell-specific differences in the activation of PERK accounting for the selectivity
of the myc increases in 8226 cells. However, this possibility does not detract from the
importance of stimulated IRES activity to maintain myc translation during ER stress.

Author Manuscript

We have previously reported (21) that a MNK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF-4E could
maintain translation of selective viability-promoting mRNAs in MM cells without causing
dangerous elevations in global translation. However, c-myc translation was not supported in
this manner (17). The current study demonstrates an additional MNK-dependent response,
namely stimulation of IRES activity, which is critical for continued myc translation and
viability during ER stress. As such, the study also identifies the myc IRES as an especially
promising therapeutic target in MM and, as a proof of principle, demonstrates the efficacy of
a specific IRES inhibitor when used in combination with ER stress inducers. If nonmalignant host cells are not as impacted by ER stress and retain NL cap-dependent
translation, they would not be adversely affected by an IRES inhibitor and a ‘therapeutic
window’ would exist.

Author Manuscript

Prior work also supports ERK/p38MAPK pathways and IRES stimulation as protective
responses to ER stress (22–24). Our work identifies MNK1 activity as the probable link
between upstream MAPK pathway activation and IRES upregulation. The stimulation of
hnRNPA1/RPS25 binding during ER stress and its prevention by a MNK inhibitor suggest
the following model: ER stress stimulates MNK activity subsequent to upstream MAPK
activation. The A1 ITAF binds the myc IRES in the nucleus and accompanies it to the
cytoplasm. At that site, MNK phosphorylates A1 and/or the ribosomal protein RPS25,
resulting in enhanced A1/RPS25 binding. Via the A1/RPS25 interaction, ribosomal loading
to the myc IRES is facilitated leading to IRES-dependent translation. In support of this
hypothesis is the finding that MNK-1-induced phosphorylation of A1 has been reported
(25). Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that recombinant MNK1 can also
phosphorylate RPS25 (not shown).

In addition to ER stress, dysregulated myc itself may render MM cells sensitive to an IRES
inhibitor. Myc-driven tumorigenesis requires a heightened UPR and autophagic response to
deal with ER stress due to increased protein expression (26) and the myc transcriptional
program accomplishes this. In likewise fashion, the transcriptional program includes
elements of the IRES machinery like RPS25 (27). An additional myc IRES ITAF, YB-1, is
also transcriptionally induced by myc in MM cells (28). These data underscore a positive
feedback loop in MM where dysregulated myc transcriptionally induces the IRES
machinery, including the myc ITAFs hnRNP A1 and YB-1, which, in turn, are critical for
translation of myc. Thus, there is additional scientific rationale for targeting myc IRES
function in myc-driven tumors.
It remains to be seen whether constitutive MM cell ER stress in patients is sufficient to
render the malignant clone susceptible to an IRES inhibitor or whether additional ER stress
must be induced. If additional stress is required, the future promise of such drugs would be
in combination with bortezomib as we have shown. However, other combinations are

possible as well. For example, as myc IRES function is a mode of resistance to mTOR
inhibitors (29), combined use of the myc IRES inhibitor with an mTOR inhibitor may be
efficacious. In addition, combining an IRES inhibitor to prevent myc translation with a
bromodomain inhibitor (30, 31) to prevent myc transcription might allow a more profound
ablation of myc expression with only moderate doses of each drug necessary so as to avoid
serious side effects.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Cell lines, reagents, plasmids

Author Manuscript

The MM cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The pRF reporter construct was a kind gift of
Dr. A. Willis (Univ of Leicester). The myc IRES was cloned into pRF as described (6) to
obtain pRmF. The Cricket paralysis virus empty vector, wild type and mutated IRES
dicistronic reporter plasmids were gifts of Dr. Eric Jan (University of British Columbia) and
previously described (32). The plKO vectors targeting A1 and RPS 25 were purchased from
Life Technologies. Lentiviral infection of MM cells was performed as described (7).
CGP57380, PD98059 and SB202190 were purchased from Calbiochem and EMD Millipore.
Primary MM cells
Primary MM cells were obtained and purified as described (6,7).
Evaluation of translation, protein turnover and RNA

Author Manuscript

Polysome analysis was performed as described (6). Briefly, after separation of extracts on a
15–50% sucrose gradient, fractions were collected and UV absorbance at 254nm measured
to generate a polysome profile to differentiate monosome and polysome fractions.
Associated myc RNA was quantified by qt-PCR. C-myc protein turnover assays were
performed as described (6). Quantitative PCR for myc RNA and GAPDH RNA was
performed as described (6).
Myc IRES activity
Reporter constructs were transfected into lines using Effectene Transfection Reagent
(Qiagen). Transfection efficiency was generally 5–10%. After 18 hrs, cells were treated and
then harvested, followed by detection of luciferase activities as described (6). All luciferase
activity is normalized to the luciferase values obtained for pRF in the absence of treatment.
RNA pull-down assay

Author Manuscript

This assay was performed as described (33). Briefly, the biotinylated c-myc 5′UTR was
generated as described (33). Cell extract (200 ug) was mixed with 12.5 pmol of biotinylated
probe in binding buffer for 15 mins at 30°C and added to 400 ul streptavidin magnetic
particles (Promega) for 10 mins at room temperature to allow binding. After dissociation of
RNA from bound proteins, the latter were identified by immunoblot.
TAT-hybrid screen
The TAT-hybrid screen was performed as described (14) and depicted in supplemental fig 5.

Cytotoxicity assays and statistical analysis
Percent viable recovery is determined by enumeration of trypan blue-negative viable cells
with comparison to controls. Data are means+/−SD with t-test used to determine
significance. Percent apoptosis is determined as described (6,7). Combinatorial indices were
calculated as described (35) using Calcusyn software Version 1.1.1 (Biosoft). CI values for
‘cytotoxicity’ were calculated from mean results of trypan blue cell survival assays while CI
values for ‘apoptosis’ were calculated from mean results of apoptosis assays quantified by
flow cytometric analysis for activated caspase 3-positive cells.
