Activated MEK cooperates with Cdkn2a and Pten loss to
promote the development and maintenance of melanoma

The development of targeted inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, has led to improved clinical outcome for melanoma patients
with BRAFV600E mutations. Although the initial response to these inhibitors can be dramatic, sometimes causing complete tumor
regression, the majority of melanomas eventually become resistant. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) mutations are
found in primary melanomas and frequently reported in BRAF melanomas that develop resistance to targeted therapy; however,
melanoma is a molecularly heterogeneous cancer, and which mutations are drivers and which are passengers remains to be
determined. In this study, we demonstrate that in BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines, activating MEK mutations drive resistance and
contribute to suboptimal growth of melanoma cells following the withdrawal of BRAF inhibition. In this manner, the cells are drugaddicted, suggesting that melanoma cells evolve a ‘just right’ level of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and the additive
effects of MEK and BRAF mutations are counterproductive. We also used a novel mouse model of melanoma to demonstrate that
several of these MEK mutants promote the development, growth and maintenance of melanoma in vivo in the context of Cdkn2a
and Pten loss. By utilizing a genetic approach to control mutant MEK expression in vivo, we were able to induce tumor regression
and signiﬁcantly increase survival; however, after a long latency, all tumors subsequently became resistant. These data suggest that
resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is probably inevitable, and novel therapeutic approaches are needed to target dormant
tumors.

INTRODUCTION
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is
constitutively activated in over 85% of malignant cutaneous
melanomas, due to BRAF (~40%), NRAS (~25%), NF1 (~13%) and
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) (~8%) mutations.1–3
BRAFV600E/D/K mutations (BRAFT1799A/G/GTIndelAA) lead to constitutive
kinase activity and elevated downstream signaling, which drives
cell proliferation and survival; however, these mutations are also
found in benign nevi, and alone are insufﬁcient for malignancy.4
Homozygous deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A
(CDKN2A), the melanoma susceptibility locus, is found in ~ 40% of
sporadic melanomas; and promoter methylation leading to
silencing and loss of expression is observed in a high proportion
of the remaining tumors.5 This locus encodes two proteins, p16
(INK4a) and p14 (ARF). Loss of p14ARF permits unregulated cell
division while loss of p16INK4a leads to dysregulation of p53 and
pervasive genetic instability.6,7
In patients with late-stage BRAFV600E melanomas, BRAF
inhibitors (for example, dabrafenib or vemurafenib) confer a
survival advantage when compared with chemotherapy, demonstrating improvements in response-rates, progression-free survival
and overall survival.8,9 Initial responses to BRAF inhibitors are not
durable, and patient relapse usually occurs within 6–7 months.8,10
The use of concurrent BRAF and MEK inhibitors (for example,
cobimetinib, selumetinib or trametinib) for patients with melanoma has been established as a synergistic treatment approach

and one that has further improved response compared with BRAF
monotherapy.11 However, the majority of patients still develop
resistance12,13 (Figure 1). Mechanisms of resistance to single agent
or combination therapies include mutations in MEK1 (MAP2K1)
and MEK2 (MAP2K2), increased COT1 (MAP3K8) and CRAF
expression, NRAS-activating mutations, gain in BRAFV600E copy
number and splice variants impervious to mutant-speciﬁc BRAF
inhibitors,14–20 and the up-regulation of the receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs), including MET, AXL, ERBB2, PDGFR-β, EGRF and
IGF1R. These RTKs can also activate the phosphatidyl-inositol-3kinase/AKT pathway, which is active in most melanomas,21 due to
the loss of PTEN expression, or activation of PI3KCA or AKT
mutation.22–27 A phase II clinical study by Trunzer et al.28 identiﬁed
activating MEK1Q56P and MEK1E203K mutations in vemurafenibresistant melanomas that were not present in pre-treated tumors.
These mutations were predictably accompanied by a strong upregulation of phosphorylated MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) levels, indicative of MAPK pathway stimulation.28
Similarly, Emery et al.29 detected a MEK1P124L mutation that
emerged in a resistant metastatic melanoma following patient
treatment with PLX4720 (a BRAF inhibitor closely related to
vemurafenib and selumetinib).29 A massively parallel sequencing
study by Wagle et al.30 identiﬁed a MEK1C121S mutation in a
metastatic melanoma patient who had developed clinical
resistance to vemurafenib. This mutation was later shown to
confer robust resistance to PLX4720 and selumetinib in vitro.11

Figure 1. Scheme depicting mechanisms of resistance observed to BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Resistance is largely
mediated by alternative means of MAPK pathway activation. Mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 that interfere with drug binding-pockets or that
upregulate inherent kinase activity mediate resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The pathway can also be reactivated through gain-offunction NRASQ61H/K/R mutations, alternative splice variants of BRAFV600E, overexpression of BRAFV600E, CRAF or Cancer Osaka thyroid
oncogene (COT1) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations. Overexpression of RTKs including platelet-derived growth factor
receptor β (PDGFRβ), epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB2), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR1), hepatocyte growth factor
receptor (MET) and AXL RTK have also been proposed to drive resistance.

More recently, Van Allen et al.14 conducted a comprehensive
whole-exome sequencing study of BRAFV600E-resistant metastatic
melanomas from 45 patients who received vemurafenib or
dabrafenib monotherapy. Numerous MEK mutations were
detected in these tumors, including MEK1V60E, MEK1G128V,
MEK1V154L, MEK2V35M, MEK2L46F, MEK2C125S (homologous to
MEK1C121S) and MEK2N126D, none of which had been detected in
pre-treated tumors. In vitro experiments conﬁrmed tumor
resistance to dabrafenib and trametinib, but not to ERK
inhibition.14 MEK1T55IndelRT has also been reported to drive
resistance in tumor xenografts.31 A meta-analysis by Johnson
et al. described an overall incidence of 7% for MEK1/2 mutations in
vemurafenib-resistant melanomas.32 Although frequently accompanied by atypical BRAFG593S, L597R, K601E mutations, BRAFV600E
mutations or NRASQ61R mutations, MEK mutations are also found
in primary melanomas in the absence of other driver mutations.3
Melanoma is a molecularly heterogeneous cancer with a
mutation load that exceeds all other cancers.5 As a result,
differentiating passenger from driver mutations or assessing their
relative contribution is comparatively difﬁcult. Several resistance
mutations have even been proposed within the same patient or
tumor, which substantially complicates the study of resistance
mechanisms.31 Here, using a novel mouse model of melanoma
that permits temporal regulation and targeted delivery of genes

into somatic cells, we investigated whether MEK mutations, found
in resistant melanomas, can drive the development and maintenance of melanoma in vivo.33 We also assessed their differential
sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibition and examined whether
complete inhibition of mutant MEK would lead to sustained tumor
regression or if resistance would develop.
RESULTS
Relative activity of MEK mutants found in BRAF inhibitor-resistant
melanoma
Although several MEK mutations have been identiﬁed in resistant
melanomas, whether these are passenger or driver mutations is
not clear. To compare the activity of a panel of MEK1 mutations
found in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cell lines, 293FT cells,
which have low basal MAPK activity, were transfected with a
bicistronic green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) vector containing
either wild-type MEK, MEKIndel55RT, MEKQ56P, MEKV60E, MEKC121S,
MEKG128V MEKP124L, MEKV154L, MEKGF or BRAFV600E. An empty GFP
vector was transfected as an additional control. Following cell
transfection, immunoblotting was used to evaluate the levels of
phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (P-ERK), P-MEK and P-p90 ribosomal S6
kinase (P-RSK) at 48 h. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated
a 95% or higher transfection efﬁciency in transfected cells.

BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines expressing MEK mutants are
addicted to BRAF inhibitors
MEK mutants have been proposed to drive resistance to BRAF
inhibition in melanoma. To assess resistance to BRAF, MEK and
ERK inhibition, three well-characterized human BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines (A375, M14 and SKMEL5) were infected with
bicistronic GFP lentivirus containing either wild-type MEK,
MEKV60E, MEKC121S, MEKG128V, MEKP124L or MEKV154L while they
were maintained in media containing a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib). Clonogenic assays, performed in triplicate,
demonstrated that several of the MEK mutants not only confer
resistance to BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib or dabrafenib), but the
cell lines become addicted to the presence of the inhibitors
resulting in all exhibiting greater growth in the presence of the
inhibitor than without, with the exception of WT and V154L MEK
(Figure 3). This effect was even more pronounced in M14 and
SKMEL5 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). The addiction was still
evident even when the BRAF inhibitor was withdrawn for 7 days or
when cells were maintained under 2.5-times the original dose of
the inhibitor (Figure 3). We next used trametinib to assess the
effect of MEK inhibition. In the dynamic inhibitor range used, with
the exception of V154L, all MEK mutants assayed provided
increased resistance to trametinib. However, this effect was
abrogated by combining trametinib with either 1 μM vemurafenib
or 50 nM dabrafenib. A similar, but much more pronounced effect,
was observed using the ERK inhibitor, ulixertinib (Supplementary
Figure 2). This suggests it is the increased level of ERK activation
that the MEK mutants provide that requires additional inhibition.
Immunoblotting of extracts of MEK mutant cell lines in the
presence or absence of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, demonstrated increased levels of phosphorylated and total FRA1, ELK,
phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated RSK in the MEK mutant
cell lines compared with controls in the absence of BRAF
inhibition. These levels were elevated even further when the
drug was withdrawn (Figure 4a). Apoptosis was restricted to the
control and MEK WT cells in the presence of BRAF inhibition as
demonstrated by lack of poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. In
contrast, protein translation-related proteins S6 RP, eIF4B and AKT
were activated in all mutant cell lines in the presence or absence
of BRAF inhibition. Phosphorylation of FRA1 by ERK increases
protein stability and leads to overexpression of FRA1 (Entrez-Gene
Id 8061) in cancer cells,34 and while increased FRA1 expression
was observed in all mutant cell lines, poly ADP ribose polymerase
was elevated in MEK mutant cell lines in the absence of BRAF
inhibition. The increased levels of P-FRA1, P-ERK, P-RSK and
decrease in cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase was highly
signiﬁcant as shown by densitometry measurements taken from
three independent experimental replicates (Supplementary
Figure 3). These results were conﬁrmed by demonstrating that
withdrawal of BRAF inhibition in MEK mutant cell lines leads to
increased MAPK activation possibly leading to negative feedback
signaling in a manner proportional to the activity of the MEK

Relative Signal

These experiments were conducted in triplicate and then
subjected to densitometry measurement. As expected, the
BRAFV600E positive control induced very high levels of P-ERK,
and P-RSK, whereas wild-type MEK had no detectable activity.
BRAFV600E had 4.2 times the activity of MEKGF (P o 0.05
densitometry, data not shown for clarity). MEKIndel55RT, MEKQ56P,
MEKV60E and MEKC121S all possessed similarly increased levels of
(P-ERK/P-RSK) activity while MEKG128V had signiﬁcantly reduced
activity (Figures 2a and b). Similar to other mutants found in
resistant melanoma, MEKP124L and MEKV154L were both phosphorylated at Ser217 & Ser221; however, ERK and RSK phosphorylation was not detected. The phosphorylation-sites on MEKGF are
destroyed by the activating mutations, and consequently, no
P-MEK band was detected.

(b) Densitometry measurements from three experimental replicates
showing MEKGF had higher activity than any of the naturally

had similar activity, C121s trended toward lower activity, but this
was not statistically signiﬁcant. MEKG128V had lower activity than
C121S (P o0.05). P-ERK and P-RSK were not observed for P124L or
V154L although P-MEK was detected.

mutant (Figure 4b). The downstream MAPK activity of the
mutants was as expected directly related to resistance to BRAF
inhibitors (V60E4C121S4G128V). No increase in apoptosis,
autophagy or changes in cell cycle distribution was detected
between MEK mutant cell lines following the withdrawal of
vemurafenib as shown by ﬂow cytometry assay results
(Supplementary Figure 4). However, many more viable MEK
mutant cells were observed in the absence of the inhibitor
(Supplementary Figure 5A). These results suggest that the
melanoma cell lines adapt to an optimal level of MAPK signaling
and that concomitant activation of BRAF and MEK appears
counterproductive.
MEK activation promotes the transformation of melanocytes
Anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark of transformation.
Accordingly, we used a soft agar assay to assess whether MEK
mutants promote colony formation in melanocytes. Melanocytes
isolated from the skin of Dct::TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice were
infected with an RCAS virus encoding Cre to delete Cdkn2a and

Pten. Loss of Ink4a, Arf and Pten in these cells resulted in
continuous proliferation without detectable senescence crisis in
more than 20 population doublings, suggesting that they are
immortal. These immortalized melanocytes were then infected
with RCAS viruses containing GFP, BRafV600E, wild-type MEK or
MEKGF. Immunoblotting of cell lysates conﬁrmed expression in the
infected melanocytes. To ensure that MEKGF and BRafV600E were
active, we evaluated the levels of phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (P-ERK)
following serum starvation. MEKGF and BRafV600E induced elevated
levels of P-ERK, whereas GFP and wild-type MEK controls did not
(Supplementary Figure 5B). To assess the ability of MEKGF and
BRafV600E to induce anchorage-independent growth in vitro, a soft
agar colony growth assay was performed. Whereas GFP- and
MEKWT-expressing immortalized melanocytes were unable to
grow in soft agar, MEKGF and BRafV600E-expressing immortalized
melanocytes formed numerous colonies, demonstrating their
ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (Supplementary Figure 5C). These clonal cell populations were highly
pigmented, conﬁrming their melanocytic origin.

MEK activation cooperates with Cdkn2a and Pten inactivation to
induce melanoma
To study the role of MEK mutants in melanoma development,
resistance and maintenance, we utilized the RCAS/TVA melanoma
mouse model to validate MEK oncogenic mutations in vivo.33,35
Using this system, multiple genetic alterations can be introduced
into the same cell, in the context of an unaltered microenvironment. Newborn Dct::TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice were injected
subcutaneously with either RCAS Cre, MEKGF+Cre, MEKWT+Cre,
MEKV60E+Cre, MEKC121S+Cre or MEKG128V+Cre virus. For comparative purposes, we also delivered BRafV600E+Cre. Mice were
subsequently monitored for tumor growth and development. All
of the mice injected with MEKGF+Cre developed melanomas
(22/22) and the mean survival was 58 days (range 34–98;
Figure 5a). Thirty three percent (6/18) of the mice injected with
MEKV60E+Cre developed tumors within 120 days, with the mean
survival of tumor-bearing mice at 83.5 days (range 68–97 days).
Forty percent (5/13) of mice injected with MEKC121S+Cre developed tumors and the mean survival of tumor-bearing mice in this

in the mice injected with Cre+MEKG128V within 160 days (0/7). All
of the mice injected with BRafV600E (15/15) developed melanoma
within 120 days, and the mean survival was 50 days (range 36–
100 days; Figure 5a). No signiﬁcant difference was observed
between MEKC121S+Cre and MEKV60E+Cre (P = 0.563). The difference in survival between MEKGF+Cre and BRafV600E+Cre tumorbearing mice just reached statistical signiﬁcance (P = 0.040).
However, the large survival variances for MEKGF and BRafV600E
were driven by a single slow growing tumor in each cohort. If
these outliers are removed, variance drops signiﬁcantly (MEKGF
mean 56.5, range 34–75 vs BRafV600E mean 46.5, range 36–58 days)
and the statistical difference between the two cohorts becomes
highly signiﬁcant (P = 2.04 − 04). The differences between MEKGF
and MEKV60E (P = 3.19 − 09) or MEKC121S (P = 4.87 − 05) were highly
signiﬁcant with the MEKGF cohort demonstrating reduced tumor
latency. All TVA-negative controls (n = 36) and controls infected
with MEKWT+Cre (n = 12) or Cre alone (n = 17) remained tumor
free. Lung metastases were detected in 5% (1/22) of MEKGF tumorbearing mice by a board certiﬁed pathologist (AHG). No other
tumor types or brain metastases were detected. No signiﬁcant
difference was observed between the incidence or survival of
BRafV600E+Cre tumors in the Dct::TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice
reported here and those induced with Cre alone in Dct::TVA;BRafCA;
Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice we have reported previously
(P = 0.145).35 The expression of Cre, MEKGF and BRafV600E was
conﬁrmed using RT-PCR on RNA extracted from melanoma tissue.
Cre activity was conﬁrmed by PCR for the Pten exon 5 deletion.
Western blotting of protein lysates from BrafV600E tumors
conﬁrmed the expression of the mutant protein (Supplementary
Figures 6a and b).

Suppression of MEKGF results in prolonged tumor regression but
all tumors recur
As discussed earlier, multiple animal and human studies have
assessed the efﬁcacy of selumetinib, trametinib and cobimetinib
alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors. In culture, these
inhibitors are highly effective and at the right dose completely
block MAPK signaling.17,31,36 Despite this, combinatorial MEK and
BRAF inhibition has not proven to be curative in most patients and
tumors nearly always recur.12,13 We reasoned the crux of the
problem might not lie with the inhibitors themselves, but the
inability to speciﬁcally and effectivity target tumor cells in a
prolonged manner at a dose that does not have disproportionate
effects on processes required by normal tissues.37,38 To test this
hypothesis, we used a genetic approach to examine the effects of
complete inhibition of mutant MEK on melanoma maintenance
in vivo. To allow for regulation of MEKGF expression in vivo using
the Tet-regulated system, we utilized the RCAN(A) vector as
opposed to RCAS, wherein expression is decoupled from the viral
long-terminal repeat through the deletion of a key splice acceptor
site,39 and is instead driven from a Tet-responsive element (TRE).
Expression from the TRE requires the presence of a tetracycline
transcriptional activator such as Tet-off. In the context of Tet-off,
the Tet-responsive MEK is repressed in the presence of
doxycycline (Dox). Expression and activity of human inﬂuenza
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tagged MEKGF was ﬁrst validated
in vitro in the context of Tet-off 7 Dox before the in vivo
experiments (Supplementary Figure 4D). Newborn Dct::TVA;
Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/loxmice were injected subcutaneously with
the RCAS Tet-off P2A Cre and RCAN TRE-HA-MEKGF virus. Tumor
development and growth were monitored daily. When the tumors
reached 1000 mm3, the mice were randomly assigned to receive
standard feed (untreated) or Dox-containing food to suppress MEK
expression and determine whether down-regulation of MEK
expression results in tumor regression. Survival rates were
compared between all cohorts of untreated mice using a
log-rank test of the Kaplan–Meier estimate of survival (Figure 5b).

No difference in the survival of tumor-bearing mice was observed
between RCAS MEKGF (n = 22) and RCAN TRE HA-MEKGF+Tet-off
cohorts (n = 4; P = 0.112). The administration of Dox and subsequent loss of MEK expression signiﬁcantly increased survival
(P = 0.0067). No tumors developed in a cohort of 11 control mice
injected with RCAS Tet-off P2A Cre alone throughout the entire
experimental period. The mean survival for the untreated RCAN
TRE HA-MEKGF+Tet-off mice was 74 days (range 63–98 days) and
the mean survival for the Dox-treated mice (n = 4) was 166 days
(range 122–191 days). One animal experienced a period of stable
disease, but all other mice experienced near complete tumor
regression (Figure 5c). However, following a prolonged latency, all

responsible for mediating tumor recurrence, we evaluated all
tumor tissue for expression of virally delivered MEK by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the HA epitope tag
on MEK (Figure 5d). HA expression was absent from Dox-treated
tumors but present in untreated controls. Further assessment
revealed that several of the resistant tumors appeared to have
reactivated the MAPK pathway through an alternate mechanism
(Figure 5d).
Tumor histology
The MEK and BRafV600E melanomas were indistinguishable from
each other and from the melanomas arising in Dct::TVA;BrafCA;
Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice36 infected with Cre, as we have
previously reported.35 As with Dct::TVA NRasQ61R 33 and BRafCA 4
tumors, all of the melanomas arising in this study were highly
invasive and consisted primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting
high-grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli (Figure 6a).
The melanocytic origin of tumors arising in both the Dct::TVA
mouse models has previously been established using IHC for S100,
HMB-45 and MART-1.33 The melanocytic origin of the MEK tumor
cohorts was again conﬁrmed by immunostaining for S100.
Staining for P-ERK revealed consistently high levels of canonical
MAPK activation in all tumors. All tumors had similar immunoproﬁles, with a slight variation in the expression of individual
markers. IHC for the cellular proliferation marker, Ki67, demonstrated that all tumors were highly proliferative (Figure 6a). RCAN

TRE HA-MEKGF+Tet-off tumor sections were also evaluated for
expression of virally delivered MEK using immunostaining for the
HA epitope tag. Although both nuclear and cytoplasmic HA
expression was present in untreated tumors, HA expression was
entirely absent from Dox-treated tumors (Figure 6b). Immunostaining, using antibodies to detect cleaved caspase 3 demonstrated increased apoptosis in an TRE HA-MEKGF+Tet-off
tumor collected following 96 h of Dox treatment compared
to an untreated TRE HA-MEKGF+Tet-off tumor (Supplementary
Figure 7). Large areas of dead tissue were also apparent in the
Dox-treated tumor, which had lost a third of its volume in the
preceding 96 h.

DISCUSSION
Here, we report for the ﬁrst time that melanoma initiation, growth
and maintenance can be driven by activating MEK mutations. This
is signiﬁcant because a wide range of MEK mutations are
frequently found in vemurafenib/dabrafenib-resistant melanomas
and in primary untreated melanomas.3 That MEK has shown
susceptibility to a particularly broad spectrum of gain-of-function
mutations highlights the many escape routes to activation and its
evolutionary ﬂexibility in the context of melanoma pathogenesis.
Using the RCAS/Dct:TVA mouse model of melanoma, we found
that gain-of-function MEK1 mutations (V60E, C121S and GF) are
capable of transforming melanoma cells in vitro and driving highgrade melanoma in the context of Cdkn2a and Pten loss. The
ability of any particular gain-of-function MEK mutation to drive
melanoma is directly related to its ability to activate MAPK
effectors, most immediately ERK. Not all MEK mutations found in
melanomas treated with MEK and BRAFV600E inhibitors will be
activating. In fact, some we have found (for example, MEKV154) are
largely passenger mutations conferring little to no growth
advantage whereas others (for example, V60E, C121S and
G128V) confer not only a growth advantage, but increased
insensitivity to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors or primarily act to
confer resistance to MEK inhibitors (for example, MEKP124L). Our
results further show that activating MEK mutations that have
arisen in melanoma cells with BRAFV600E mutations result in
suboptimal melanoma growth following the withdrawal of BRAF
inhibition. This suggests that melanoma cells have selected
through clonal evolution for an optimal level of MAPK signaling,
and that the additive effects of a MEK mutation and a BRAF
mutation are counterproductive. This effect was clearly still
evident several weeks after BRAF inhibitor withdrawal. In this
manner, that BRAF cell lines with activating MEK mutations are
‘addicted’ to BRAF inhibitors is apparent. Interestingly, we found
that the MEK mutations we studied provided additional resistance
to both MEK and ERK inhibitors in a manner clearly related to their
ability to activate ERK because the effect was more pronounced
for ERK inhibition than it was for MEK inhibition. This dichotomy
suggests that some MEK mutants are not, as has been widely
reported11,30,40 providing direct resistance to the MEK inhibitor.
Instead, it is the increased level of ERK activation, which they
provide, that requires additional inhibition. The increased
resistance to ERK inhibition by MEK mutants, which we report
herein, is highly novel and has not been previously reported.
Counter intuitively, because of the clear addition of the MEK
mutant cell lines to BRAF inhibition, exposure of MEK mutant cell
lines to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors gave the best response,
which is a clinically relevant ﬁnding. Narita Y et al. provide an
example of how MEK mutants (MEKC121S) can respond very
differently to the alternative MEK inhibitors, E6201 and selumetinib. However, we have shown that MEKC121S signaling can be
blocked by a moderate increase in the dose of trametinib, a dose
that remains signiﬁcantly lower than that of selumetinib or
E6201.40 MEK mutations may be less common than BRAFV600E
mutations in primary melanomas, because in our cellular assay,

their relative ability to stimulate the MAPK pathway was less than
a quarter of the ERK activating activity of BRAFV600E. Furthermore,
the speed of tumor formation in our mouse model was
proportionally related to the apparent MAPK activity of the
mutants.
Although very effective MEK inhibitors exist, complete and
sustained systemic MEK inhibition is probably neither desirable
nor obtainable in melanoma patients due to the importance of the
MAPK pathway to normal cells. Accordingly, clinical trials using
MEK inhibitors alone have been far less successful than for
BRAFV600E inhibitors in BRAFV600E melanoma.41,42 By using a
genetic approach, we were able to circumvent these issues as a
means of precisely determining if inactivation of MEK could be an
effective treatment for melanoma. Tet-responsive MEK mutant
melanomas treated with Dox regressed signiﬁcantly and showed
increased survival compared with untreated controls; however,
after a long latency, all tumors subsequently developed resistance.
This result does not infer that MEK is an inappropriate therapeutic
target; to the contrary, it infers that as with BRAF mutated
melanomas treated with BRAF inhibitors, a subpopulation of
melanoma cells survive and lie dormant prior to reoccurrence.
These results also infer new and improved MEK or BRAF inhibitors
are likely not the solution. In this manner, our melanoma mouse
model is ideal for the study of tumor dormancy and resistance,
both to BRAF and MEK inhibition, and is well suited to determine
and validate additional genetic alterations found in recurrent
tumors that may be responsible for resistance and regrowth.
Our results provide strong evidence showing that a broad
spectrum of MEK mutations over-stimulate the MAPK pathway
and ultimately generate tumors that mimic the tumor pathology
and aggressive nature of BRAFV600E-driven melanomas. Our
ﬁndings are clinically relevant for several reasons. First, we have
shown that an activating MEK mutation is not simply a benign
passenger mutation but, instead, a potent and nocuous mutation
that promotes cell transformation and aggressive malignancy.
Owing to the propensity of MEK to evolve an array of activating
mutations, our results support the co-targeting of alternative
MAPK pathway members in conjunction with BRAF inhibitors for
patients with high-grade, BRAFV600E-driven melanoma. Given that
mutations that reactivate the MAPK pathway are relatively
common in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanomas and that melanomas evolve to an optimal level of MAPK signaling, escalating
inhibitor doses over time from the lowest active to the highest
tolerated, and the eventual addition of ERK inhibition and
treatment holidays may improve patient outcomes. Whether or
not MEK gain-of-function mutations are present pre- or post-BRAF
and/or MEK inhibition (that is, a driver or contributor to
oncogenesis versus an evolved resistance mechanism) are factors
that will require careful consideration and clinical planning when
developing a treatment strategy for melanoma patients. What is
almost certain is that like BRAF-activating mutations, MEKactivating mutations combined with loss of tumor suppressors
in melanocytes are likely to produce melanoma and may require
special considerations in the clinic to optimize patient care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal model
Dct::TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox; mice were crossed with mice carrying a ﬂoxed Pten
allele (a gift from M. McMahon and M. Bosenberg) to generate Dct::TVA;
Cdkn2alox/lox;Ptenlox/lox mice. All mice were maintained on a mixed C57Bl/6
and FVB/N background by random interbreeding. Litters of newborn male
and female mice were infected as previously described.33 The number of
mice was determined based on previous experience with this model to
obtain statistically meaningful results at the 95% conﬁdence interval.
Sample sizes were as follow RCAS Cre (n = 17), MEKGF+Cre (n = 22),
MEKWT+Cre (n = 12), MEKV60E+Cre (n = 18), MEKC121S+Cre (n = 13), or
MEKG128V+Cre (n = 7), Tet-off P2A Cre (n = 11) and Tet-off P2A Cre+TRE-

MEKGF (n = 8), and BRafV600E+Cre (n = 15). DNA was prepared from tail
biopsies and genotyped at 17 days as described.33,35 Mating pairs were
randomized with respect to viral infection of their litters. No blinding
approach was used during this study. No infected mouse with the correct
genotype was excluded from analysis. Censored survival data was analyzed
using a log-rank test of the Kaplan–Meier estimate of survival. To compare
means, two-tailed Student’s t-test was used. P-values below 0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant. All animal experiments were performed in
compliance with ‘Care and Use of Animals’ in Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facilities,
and approved by the University of Minnesota IACUC.

Vectors
The retroviral vectors used in this study were replication-competent avian
leukosis virus long-terminal repeat, splice acceptor and bryan polymerasecontaining vectors of envelope subgroup A, designated RCASBP(A) and
replication-competent, avian leukosis long-terminal repeat, no splice
acceptor designated RCANBP(A). The RCAS(A) receptor is encoded by
the Tumor Viruses A (TVA) gene that is normally expressed in avian cells. In
transgenic mice express the TVA receptor under the control of the
dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) promoter this allows the targeting of the
virus speciﬁcally to melanocytes in vivo. In mammalian cells that express
TVA, the viral vector is capable of stably integrating into the DNA and
expressing the inserted experimental gene, but the virus is replicationdefective. RCASBP(A) Cre, Tet-off and MEKGF have been previously
described,37,43 as has RCANBP(A)TRE.44 MEKGF is a constitutively active
MEK1 with S218E and S222D substitutions and lacking residues 32–51
(ΔN3). MEK mutants were created using PCR mutagenesis and cloned into
pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and veriﬁed by Sanger
sequencing. Genes were then recombined into the RCAS, RCAN or
lentiviral vectors (FG12-cmv-DV-Ubic-GFP) using LR Clonase (Invitrogen) for
subsequent transfection and or viral production, infection, and stable
expression.45 Primer sequences and cloning strategies are available on
request. ‘BRafV600E’ used for these studies was cloned from a mouse
melanocyte complementary DNA library using primers for Braf transcript
(ENSMUST000000024870). Human BRAFV600E has been previously
described.46 Viral propagation, and in vivo and in vitro infection was
performed as previously described.33

Cell culture
Melanoma cell lines from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCCA375s, SKMEL5s) or National Cancer Institute (M14s) were grown in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). DF-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium-high glucose media supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen),
2.5 ml gentamicin, and maintained at 39 °C. Mouse melanocytes were
grown in 254 media supplemented with 10% FBS, HMGS, 2.5 ml
gentamicin and maintained at 37 °C. 293FTs (ATCC) were maintained in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented with 5% FBS. Transfection of FG12 vector DNA into 293FTs, 0.5 μg of DNA per 200 K cells, was
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assessment of anchorageindependent growth was performed as described.46 Clonogenic assay:
melanoma cells were seeded at 3000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were
stained with 0.25% crystal violet Crystal Violet (C0775, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) in 50% methanol. After drying, the crystal violate was
dissolved in 10% acetic acid and optical density measured at 450 nm
(Epoch microplate reader, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). Drugs: Vemurafenib,
dabrafenib, ulixertinb and trametinib were purchased from Selleckchem,
(Houston, TX, USA). All experiments were performed using biological
replicates in triplicate.

Western blotting
Immunostaining for HA was performed using an anti-HA monoclonal
antibody (HA.11, Covance, Berkeley, CA, USA) at a 1:1000 dilution, and for
V5 using a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting V5 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) at a 1:1000 dilution. Detection of BRAFV600E was performed using a
1:1000 dilution of the anti-V600E antibody RM8 (RevMAb Biosciences,
San Francisco, CA, USA). Tubulin was detected using a tubulin HRP
antibody diluted 1:5000 (21058 Abcam, MA, USA). Detection of MAPK
activation was performed using a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit monoclonal
antibody directed against phosphorylation of ERK at Thr202 and Tyr204,
and phospho-p90RSK at Ser380 (4370 & 11989, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA,

MKP3 (3058) and P-Elk (9181). For mouse on mouse tissue samples a
conformation speciﬁc secondary rat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (ab131368
Abcam) antibody diluted 1:1000 was used. All other blots were incubated
with an anti-mouse or rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody diluted (7074,
7076 Cell Signaling) 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then
incubated with premium sure ECL (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and imaged
using the Li-Cor C-DiGit chemiluminescence imager. Western blot density
analyses were normalized against internal loading controls and performed
on biological replicates in triplicate using Li-Cor Image studio digits
software. To compare means, two-tailed Student’s t-test was used. P-values
below 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Immunohistochemistry
Analysis of S100 expression was performed using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody Z0331 (1:400) for S100 (Dako; Glostrup, Denmark). Detection
of MAPK activation was performed using a 1:100 dilution of an antibody
against phospho-ERK (4370, Cell Signaling). Cell proliferation was
detected using a 1:250 dilution of a rabbit monoclonal antibody against
Ki67 (RM-9106-R7 Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). IHC HA was
performed using a 1:200) dilution of the HA.11 antibody. Apoptosis
detection was performed using a 1:250 dilution of the cleaved caspase-3
antibody (9579 Cell Signaling). Controls were conducted without primary
antibody on corresponding sections. Detection of HRP activity was
performed using DAB (Cell Signaling). Sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin.

RT-PCR
Total RNA & DNA was extracted from mouse primary tumors using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform. The SuperScript IV FirstStrand Synthesis system (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize complementary DNA from DNase-treated RNA. PCR reactions were performed
using an AccuStart II Mouse genotyping kit (Quanta biosciences,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The primers used and amplicon sizes are available
on request.
