Abstract:

Aging is one of the major risk factors of cancer. The onset of cancer can be postponed
by pharmacological and dietary anti-aging interventions. We recently found in yeast
cellular models of aging that lithocholic acid (LCA) extends longevity. Here we show
that, at concentrations that are not cytotoxic to primary cultures of human neurons,
LCA kills the neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines BE(2)-m17, SK-n-SH, SK-n-MCIXC and Lan1. In BE(2)-m17, SK-n-SH and SK-n-MCIXC cells, the LCA anti-tumor effect is due to
apoptotic cell death. In contrast, the LCA-triggered death of Lan-1 cells is not caused
by apoptosis. While low concentrations of LCA sensitize BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC
cells to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death controlled by mitochondria,
these LCA concentrations make primary cultures of human neurons resistant to such
a form of cell death. LCA kills BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cell lines by triggering not
only the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic cell death pathway driven by mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization and initiator caspase-9 activation, but also the
extrinsic (death receptor) pathway of apoptosis involving activation of the initiator
caspase-8. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism underlying a potent and
selective anti-tumor effect of LCA in cultured human NB cells. Moreover, our finding
that LCA kills cultured human breast cancer and rat glioma cells implies that it has a
broad anti-tumor effect on cancer cells derived from different tissues and organisms.

Introduction

supports the validity of this paradigm. First, aging and
cancer indeed have convergent underlying mechanisms.
They include: 1) a longevity-defining signaling network
that integrates the pro-aging AMP-activated protein
kinase/target of rapamycin (AMPK/TOR), cAMP/protein
kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and insulin/insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways and also incorporates
a sirtuin-governed protein deacetylation module [4-14];
2) a cytoprotective process of autophagy [8-9,15-23];
and 3) tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiration, and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and detoxification

Due to a multistep nature of the tumorigenesis
process whose progression and completion requires an
extended period of time, incidence rates of many cancers
increase with age [1-3]. Therefore, cancer is considered
as a disease associated with aging [3-7]. In the generally
accepted paradigm of the relationship between aging
and cancer, they share common aetiology (i.e., an agerelated progressive accumulation of cellular damage) and
have coalescent mechanisms [4-9]. A body of evidence

in mitochondria [24-32]. Second, some of the proteins
implemented in such convergent mechanisms could
function as oncoproteins, whereas others act as tumor
suppressor proteins [3-6,10-21,24-33]. Third, certain
pharmacological and dietary interventions exhibit both
anti-aging and anti-cancer effects by modulating the
longevity signaling network that integrates the AMPK/
TOR, cAMP/PKA and insulin/IGF-1 pathways and
incorporates the sirtuin-governed protein deacetylation
module [4-7,10-14,33-52].
The interplay between aging and cancer is more
complex than only sharing common aetiology and having
convergent mechanisms. In some situations aging and
cancer can have antagonistic aetiologies and divergent
mechanisms [5,8,9,53-65]. Indeed, the age-dependent
accumulation of DNA damage and mutations in normal
somatic cells (especially in adult stem and progenitor
cells) triggers telomere shortening and/or a gradual rise
in the expression of the INK4a/ARF locus encoding the
p16INK4a and p14ARF/p19ARF tumor suppressor
proteins [53-56,58,62]. Both these processes reduce the
proliferative potential of normal somatic cells, thereby
promoting cellular senescence, causing a decline in tissue
regeneration and repair, impairing tissue homeostasis,
and ultimately accelerating cellular and organismal aging
[53-58]. While both telomere shortening and enhanced
expression of INK4a/ARF display pro-aging effects in
normal somatic cells, they exhibit potent anti-cancer
effects in tumor cells by reducing their proliferative
potential [53-62]. Hence, an anti-cancer intervention
that can limit the excessive proliferation of tumor cells
by inhibiting telomerase or activating expression of
INK4a/ARF could have a pro-aging effect on cellular and
organismal levels [5,8,9,55-59,62-65].
The complexity of the interplay between aging
and cancer is further underscored by the recent findings
implying that tumor cells in the epithelia of breast
cancers can cause “accelerated aging” of adjacent
normal fibroblasts by stimulating their intracellular ROS
production [66-77]. In response to the resulting oxidative
stress these fibroblasts establish a pro-aging pattern by
activating aerobic glycolysis and autophagic degradation,
thereby providing epithelial cancer cells within the
tumor microenvironment with lactate, ketone bodies and
glutamine [67,70,76-79]. These catabolic and anabolic
substrates support proliferation of epithelial cancer cells
and, thus, accelerate tumor growth, progression and
metastasis [67,76,77]. Further emphasizing the complexity
of the relationship between aging and cancer, this model
of breast cancer as an “accelerated host aging” disease
defines autophagy (a cytoprotective anti-aging cellular
process [8,9,15-23]) within cancer-associated fibroblasts
as a pro-cancer process that supports the growth of already
established tumors [67,76,77]. In contrast, by preventing
initiation of some cancers, autophagy operates as an
anti-cancer process prior to tumor establishment [8,9,15www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

23,80-85].
We found that lithocholic acid (LCA), a bile
acid, delays chronological aging of yeast [86] known
to mimic aging of postmitotic mammalian cells (e.g.,
neurons) [87-89]. In yeast, LCA extends longevity not
by attenuating the pro-aging AMPK/TOR and cAMP/
PKA signaling pathways [86], both of which operate
as pro-cancer pathways in mice and humans [4-14].
Furthermore, we revealed that the longevity-extending
effect of LCA in chronologically aging yeast depends on
autophagy (Kyryakov et al., manuscript in preparation),
a cytoprotective anti-aging process that in different
situations can play either an anti-cancer or a pro-cancer
role [8,9,15-23,80-85]. Moreover, LCA extends yeast
chronological life span by altering the age-related
dynamics of mitochondria-confined respiration and
ROS production [86], both of which are integrated into
convergent mechanisms underlying aging and cancer
[24-32]. Additionally, we found that in chronologically
aging yeast LCA slows down telomere shortening (Iouk
et al., unpublished data), a pro-aging process that exhibits
an anti-cancer effect [53-62]. Besides, we demonstrated
that LCA not only extends the chronological life span
of quiescent yeast but also hinders cellular quiescence
and senescence by delaying replicative aging of yeast
(Lindsay et al., manuscript in preparation), which mimics
aging of mitotically active mammalian cells [87-89]. In
sum, these findings imply that in yeast models of aging
of mitotically active and inactive mammalian cells LCA
extends longevity by modulating several processes
integrated into either convergent or divergent mechanisms
underlying aging and cancer.
We therefore sought to examine if LCA exhibits
an anti-tumor effect in cultured human cancer cells
by activating certain anti-cancer processes that may
play an essential role in cellular aging. As a model for
assessing such effect of LCA, we choose several cell
lines of the human neuroblastoma (NB) tumor. NB
is the most commonly diagnosed extra-cranial solid
tumor among children [90-92]. All NBs originate from
primordial neuroblast cells that eventually differentiate
into the adrenal medulla and early sympathetic nervous
system [92-95]. In over 70% of all cases studied so far,
NBs metastasize to other tissues [90-95]. Although most
patients diagnosed with non-metastasizing NBs have
been reported to be cured, only less than 40% of those
with cancerous migration to other tissues survive despite
rigorous chemotherapeutic and surgical treatment [92].
The recurrent high-risk NB patients with an often fatal
prognosis frequently contain the following two genetic
abnormalities: 1) amplification of the MYCN gene [9698] encoding a transcription factor involved in growth,
cell metabolism and division [99]; and 2) deletion of
the short arm of chromosome 1p [100], which reduces
expression of numerous tumour-suppressing genes [101104]. One of the main challenges of combating high-risk

NB cells. We also show that LCA has a broad anti-tumor
effect on cultured cancer cells derived from different
tissues and organisms.

recurring NBs is the use of non-toxic agents that not only
prevent tumor metastasis, but also eliminate the primary
tumor. Currently, NBs are treated with a combination of
the chemotherapeutic drugs that cause apoptotic death
of malignant cancer cells by inducing DNA strand
intercalation (doxorubicin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide
and topotecan), DNA strand breaks (epipodophyllotoxins)
or mitotic inhibition (vincristine) [105-111]. Noteworthy,
all these anti-NB drugs stimulate the release of significant
amount of ROS from mitochondria [107-111].
Here we show that LCA has a potent anti-tumor effect
in four lines of cultured human NB cells. We demonstrate
that this anti-aging compound kills three of them by
causing apoptotic cell death. Our mechanistic studies of
the apoptosis-based death of NB cell cultures exposed
to LCA provide evidence that this bile acid triggers both
the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic death pathways by
binding to the cell surface and initiating the converging
intracellular cascades activating caspases-3, -6, -8 and -9.
We propose a model for a mechanism underlying a potent
and specific anti-tumor effect of LCA in cultured human

The
MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay is widely used
to determine viability of cultured mammalian cells
following drug treatment [112-116]. In this assay, only
viable, metabolically active cells are able to reduce the
yellow tetrazolium salt of MTT to form a purple formazan
product. Thus, the percentage of viable cells in the MTT
assay is calculated as the proportion of the cell population
displaying a detectable level of redox potential. Using this
assay, we found that LCA exhibits a potent and selective
anti-tumor effect in several lines of cultured human
NB cells. In fact, this bile acid killed the NB cell lines

greatly enhances the susceptibility of cultured human NB cell lines BE(2)-m17 (B) and SK-n-MCIXC (C) to such hydrogen peroxideinduced form of cell death. While 75 μM LCA causes apoptotic death of all or most of the cells of BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC exposed to
0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide (B and C, respectively), in this concentration it increases the resistance of primary cultures of human neurons to
such form of cell death (A). Nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation were visualized with the fluorescent dye Hoechst and were
used as a measure of the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death. Each panel shows two datasets for the same cell type.
One dataset is for cell aliquots treated with 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide, whereas the other dataset is for cell aliquots remained untreated. For

to Fig. 2A), even if it was used at concentrations that in
the absence of hydrogen peroxide did not compromise
their viability (compare Figs. 2B and 2C to Figs. 1A and
1B). Of note, while 75 μM LCA caused apoptotic death
of all or most of the BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells
exposed to hydrogen peroxide, this concentration of LCA
significantly increased the resistance of primary cultures
of human neurons to the hydrogen peroxide-induced form
of mitochondria-controlled apoptotic death (compare Fig.
2A to Figs. 2B and 2C). Based on these observations, it
seems likely that an exposure of a mixed population of at
least these two NB cell lines and non-cancerous neurons
to low concentrations of simultaneously added hydrogen
peroxide and LCA may concurrently 1) kill all or most
of NB cells by causing their apoptotic cell death; and
2) promote the viability of non-cancerous neurons by
increasing their resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced
apoptosis.

BE(2)-m17, SK-n-SH, SK-n-MCIXC and Lan-1 if used
at concentrations that were not cytotoxic or only mildly
cytotoxic (as in case of Lan-1) to primary cultures of
human neurons (Fig. 1A).
Chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation
are hallmark events of apoptosis that are not seen under
any other modes of cell death [117-122]. We used the
fluorescent dye Hoechst to visualize chromatin in various
NB cell cultures and in primary cultures of human
neurons exposed to LCA or remained untreated. For each
cell culture, we calculated the percentage of viable nonapoptotic cells carrying intact, non-fragmented nuclei
containing non-condensed chromatin. Dead apoptotic
cells carried condensed and/or fragmented nuclei. Our
data imply that if LCA is used at concentrations that
are not cytotoxic to primary cultures of human neurons,
it selectively kills the NB cell lines BE(2)-m17, SK-nSH and SK-n-MCIXC by causing their apoptotic death.
We found that SK-n-MCIXC is the most sensitive (as
compared to other NB cell lines tested and especially as
compared to primary cultures of human neurons) to the
apoptotic death induced by LCA (Fig. 1B), as it is to the
MTT-monitored cytotoxic effect of this bile acid (Fig.
1A). Furthermore, although BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-SH
were less sensitive to LCA-induced apoptosis than SKn-MCIXC, they exhibited much higher sensitivity to such
form of cell death (Fig. 1B) - and to the MTT-monitored
cytotoxic effect of LCA (Fig. 1A) - than primary cultures
of human neurons or the NB cell line Lan-1. Importantly,
although at the concentrations of LCA exceeding 200
µM the NB cell line Lan-1 was more sensitive to the
MTT-monitored cytotoxic effect of LCA than primary
cultures of human neurons (Fig. 1A), this cell line did not
exhibit higher sensitivity to LCA-induced apoptotic cell
death than primary neuron cultures (Fig. 1B). Thus, LCA
selectively kills Lan-1 cells via a non-apoptotic cell death
mechanism.

LCA triggers the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway of apoptotic death in two NB cell lines
As described above, LCA selectively kills the NB cell
lines BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC by causing apoptosis
and enhances their susceptibility to a hydrogen peroxideinduced form of mitochondria-controlled apoptosis. We
therefore sought to investigate if LCA kills these two NB
cell lines by activating the intrinsic apoptotic cell death
pathway. The key feature of such a pathway is mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which leads
to the release of cytochrome c (and several other proapoptotic proteins) from the mitochondrial intermembrane
space into the cytosol [129-131]. Following its efflux
from mitochondria, cytochrome c binds an apoptotic
protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) monomer whose
oligomerization into the heptameric apoptosome complex
recruits caspase-9 and ultimately activates this initiator
caspase [119,131-133]. We found that LCA significantly
increases caspase-9 activity in BE(2)-m17 and SK-nMCIXC (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in both these NB cell lines
LCA caused the fragmentation of a mitochondrial network
(Figs. 4A and 4B). Such fragmentation is one of the
earliest events of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis;
it occurs before caspase-9 activation, around the point
of MOMP and cytochrome c efflux from mitochondria
[119,129-131,134,135]. Moreover, in both these cell lines
LCA triggered the dissipation of the electrochemical
potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figs.
4C and 4D). The gradual dissipation and eventual loss
of mitochondrial transmembrane potential is a hallmark
event of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death; it
follows MOMP and occurs in both caspase-dependent and
caspase-independent fashion [119,130,131,136-139]. Of
note, the higher LCA-induced activity of caspase-9 (Fig.
3) and efficacies of both LCA-promoted mitochondrial

LCA sensitizes two NB cell lines to hydrogen
peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death
Exogenously added hydrogen peroxide has been
shown to cause mitochondria-controlled apoptotic cell
death in a variety of cultured eukaryotic cells [123-128].
Our data imply that LCA protects primary cultures of human
neurons, but not cultured human NB cell lines BE(2)-m17
or SK-n-MCIXC, against apoptosis induced in response to
exogenously added 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2).
In these experiments, chromatin condensation and nuclear
fragmentation were visualized with the fluorescent dye
Hoechst and were used as a measure of the efficacy
of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death.
Importantly, LCA greatly enhanced the susceptibility of
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC to such a mitochondriacontrolled form of cell death (compare Figs. 2B and 2C

fragmentation and LCA-triggered mitochondrial inner
membrane depolarization (Figs. 4B and 4D) observed
in SK-n-MCIXC cells, as compared to those seen in
BE(2)-m17 cells, correlated with the higher sensitivity
of SK-n-MCIXC (as compared to that of BE(2)-m17) to
the cytotoxic, apoptotic cell death-inducing and hydrogen
peroxide-sensitizing effects of LCA (Figs. 1 and 2).
Importantly, although LCA stimulated caspase-9 in
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells, it did not increase
caspase-9 activity in Lan-1 cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
if used at a concentration (i.e., 150 μM or 175 μM)
that caused mitochondrial fragmentation in most or all
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells, LCA did not stimulate
such fragmentation in Lan-1 cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
if used at a concentration (i.e., 150 μM or 200 μM) that
triggered mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization
in most or all BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells, LCA
did not cause such depolarization in Lan-1 cells (Fig. 4D).
These findings further validate our conclusion (see above)
that LCA kills Lan-1 cells via a non-apoptotic cell death
mechanism.

caspases-2 and -6 and then by the caspase-6-enabled
proteolytic activation of the executioner caspase-10; when
all these caspases become activated, they complete the
demolition phase of the mitochondria-controlled apoptotic
program by cleaving their respective protein substrates
and producing the morphological features characteristic
of apoptotic cell death [119,130,131,140,141]. In
another scenario, caspase-6 is activated independent of
caspase-3 [142-151], either by caspase-1 [148] or through
intramolecular self-cleavage [152-154], and does not
induce apoptosis [143,144,149,152,155].
We found that LCA increases caspase-3 activity in
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC (Fig. 5A) by promoting a
proteolytic conversion of a zymogen pro-caspase-3 form
into an active 17 kDa form (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the
anti-tumor effect of LCA in these two cell lines was due in
part to its ability to activate caspase-3. In fact, z-DEVDfmk, a potent and specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (Fig.
5D), significantly reduced the efficacy with which LCA
caused selective killing of BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC
cells (Fig. 5E). The observed incomplete reduction
by z-DEVD-fmk of the anti-tumor efficacy of LCA in
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC (Fig. 5E) suggests that the
LCA-triggered, mitochondria-driven apoptotic death of
both these cell lines could be due not only to a caspasedependent mechanism, but also to a caspase-independent
decline in mitochondrial function, which may lead to the
observed LCA-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation
and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Fig.
4). In BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells, LCA also
elevated caspase-6 activity (Fig. 6A) and promoted a

of this caspase into its large (p20) and small (p10) subunits
(Fig. 6B) known to assemble into an enzymatically active
heterotetramer of two p20 and two p10 [152,156]. Of note,
the different efficacies of the LCA-induced proteolytic
activation of caspase-3 and caspase-6 seen in BE(2)-m17

their dissimilar sensitivities to the cytotoxic, apoptosisinducing and hydrogen peroxide-sensitizing effects of

LCA (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, even if used at a higher

highest extent of the LCA-induced proteolytic activation

in SK-n-MCIXC and BE(2)-m17 cells, LCA did not
promote their proteolysis-driven activation in Lan-1 cells
(Figs. 5 and 6), whose LCA-induced death was not due to
apoptosis (see above).

initiated when specific extracellular death ligands cause

of the initiator caspase-8 [119,131]. In addition to its
role in the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, activated
in response to death receptor ligation caspase-8 can also
cleave and activate the BH3-only protein BID, thereby
causing MOMP and initiating the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis [119,131,157,158].
We found that LCA significantly increases the
activity of caspase-8 in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC
(Fig. 7). As it was observed for caspases-3, -6 and -9
(Figs. 5A, 6A and 3, respectively), the extent to which
caspase-8 was activated by LCA in these two cell lines
(Fig. 7) correlated with the degree of their sensitivity to
the cytotoxic, apoptosis-inducing and hydrogen peroxidesensitizing effects of LCA (Figs. 1 and 2). Importantly,
unlike the stimulating effect of LCA on caspase-8 seen
in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells, this bile acid

did not stimulate caspase-8 activity in Lan-1 cells (Fig.
7). These findings suggest that LCA could kill both
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cell lines by activating
not only the intrinsic apoptotic death pathway dependent
on the initiator caspase-9, but also the extrinsic pathway
of apoptotic death driven by the initiator caspase-8. We
therefore propose that the LCA-dependent activation of
caspase-8 seen in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells (Fig.
7) could be responsible not only for the direct proteolytic
activation of caspase-3 (Figs. 5A and 5B), but also for
MOMP (perhaps, due to BID cleavage by caspase-8) and
the resulting initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic death
pathway observed in these NB cells (Figs. 3 and 4). These
caspase-8-driven events in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC
cells are expected to enhance the extent of their demise in
response to LCA treatment.

LCA kills cultured human breast cancer (BC)
and rat glioma (GL) cells

In addition to its stimulatory effect on caspases-3,
-6, -8 and -9, LCA significantly reduced caspase-1
activity in NB cell lines BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC,
but not in Lan-1 (Suppl. Fig. 1). Caspase-1 is an
inflammatory caspase that drives the processing and
unconventional secretion of the cytokines interleukin-1β
and interleukin-18 [159-162]. Following their secretion
by mammalian cells, cytokines promote the growth and
proliferation of neighbouring cells in the same tissue [163166]. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that by reducing
caspase-1 activity in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells,
and thereby impairing their ability to process and secrete
cytokines, LCA could prevent growth and proliferation of
neighbouring NB cells in culture.

In addition to its high anti-tumor efficacy and
specificity in several NB cell lines, LCA displayed an
anti-tumor effect in two other types of cultured cancer
cells. In fact, treatment of the drug-sensitive human BC
cell line MCF7 with LCA demonstrated a dose-dependent
killing effect, as measured by the MTT cell viability assay
(Suppl. Fig. 2A). Treatment with 1 μg/ml doxorubicin
demonstrated that these BC cells were highly drug sensitive
(Suppl. Fig. 2A). Importantly, killing of MCF7 cells with
LCA was associated with DNA damage, as visualized with
antibodies against phosphorylated histone H2AX (Suppl.
Fig. 2B). Once cells encounter DNA damage, histone
H2AX phosphorylation at sites of damage has been shown
to initiate the chromatin response required for DNA repair
[167]. This is believed to serve as a docking site for DNA
repair enzymes. At doses as low as 25 and 50 μM LCA,
increased phosphorylated H2AX could be visualized in
MCF7 cells (Suppl. Fig. 2B). Since most of these BC
cells remain viable at 50 μM LCA (Suppl. Fig. 2A), DNA
damage likely precedes their killing by LCA. We also
assessed the ability of LCA to kill the cultured rat GL cell
line F98. These highly proliferative and invasive cancer
cells have increased resistance to chemo- and radiation
therapy [168]. We found that at a concentration of 100

Our mass spectrometry-based measurement of
cellular and extracellular levels of exogenously added LCA

kills these cancer cells by binding to their surface and then
initiating intracellular signaling cascades that cause their

non-apoptotic (as in case of Lan-1) death. In BE(2)-m17

human NB cells. Our findings suggest a model for two
mechanisms underlying such effect of LCA, as outlined
below. Several aspects of this model remain hypothetical.
In NB cell lines BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC,
LCA triggers both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of
apoptosis by binding to the cell surface and initiating the
intracellular cascades that cause cell death (Fig. 8A). LCA
binding to the cell surface leads to MOMP by activating
caspase-8, which in turn causes MOMP - perhaps by
cleaving and activating BID. LCA may also stimulate
TGR5, its only known receptor on the cell surface (see
below), which may then transmit a MOMP-activating
signal from the plasma membrane to mitochondria via
the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. LCA-induced MOMP
may result in efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria,

underlies the anti-tumor effect of LCA in cultured
human NB cell line Lan-1. We propose such effect of
LCA in Lan-1 is due to its ability to cause necrotic or
some other non-apoptotic kind of death, which is not
characterized by such major hallmark events of apoptosis
as nuclear condensation and fragmentation, mitochondrial
fragmentation and inner membrane depolarization, and
activation of caspases-3, -6, -8 and -9.
A reason for the observed difference in the
mechanisms by which LCA kills different NB cell lines
(i.e., by triggering apoptotic cell death of BE(2)-m17 and
SK-n-MCIXC, but by causing non-apoptotic cell death
of Lan-1) remains to be established. All these cell lines
exhibit amplified expression of the MYCN gene [96-98]
and deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1p [100104]. However, the level of an anti-apoptotic member of
the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein family containing
four BCL-2 homology (BH) domains in BE(2)-m17 is
significantly lower than that in Lan-1 [182]. The antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins prevent MOMP [183,184].
Therefore, it is conceivable that the lower efficacy of
MOMP prevention in BE(2)-m17 makes this cell line more
susceptible to LCA-induced apoptosis (which involves
MOMP activation) than Lan-1. Furthermore, it is plausible
that, due to the relatively high level of the anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 protein with four BH domains in Lan-1, this cell
line is more susceptible (as compared to BE(2)-m17) to a
MOMP-independent kind of LCA-induced non-apoptotic
cell death.
Another kind of dissimilarity between different
NB cell lines consists in lower activity of caspase-1 in
BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells (as compared to
that in Lan-1 cells) that have not been exposed to LCA;
importantly, LCA further and significantly reduces the
activity of this inflammatory caspase in BE(2)-m17 and
SK-n-MCIXC, but not in Lan-1 (Suppl. Fig. 1). This
observation suggests that certain pro-inflammatory
alterations (including elevated activity of caspase-1) in
NB cells may play an anti-apoptotic, cytoprotective role.
It is conceivable therefore that the lower activities of
caspase-1 in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC (especially
following their exposure to LCA) make these NB cell lines
more susceptible to LCA-induced apoptosis than Lan1, in which a relatively high activity of caspase-1 is not
reduced by LCA. Of note, recent findings in mice imply
that certain mild pro-inflammatory alterations, including
increased mitochondrial ROS and elevated expression
of inflammatory cytokines, can extend animal longevity
[185,186].

thereby causing apoptosome formation and the observed
caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 then activates caspase-3
by proteolytically processing pro-caspase-3. The
proteolytic activation of caspase-3 is also carried out
by caspase-8 operating in the LCA-induced extrinsic
pathway of apoptosis. Active caspase-3 completes the
demolition phase of the LCA-driven apoptotic program
by cleaving its protein substrates. Furthermore, LCA
binding to the cell surface leads to proteolytic activation
of caspase-6; the mechanism underlying such activation
(either self-cleavage or proteolytic processing by active
caspase-3) and the involvement of caspase-6 in LCAdriven apoptosis remain to be established. Moreover,
LCA binding to the cell surface causes inhibition of the
inflammatory caspase-1. Such inhibition may contribute
to the anti-tumor effect of LCA by attenuating the
processing and secretion of the cytokines interleukin1β and interleukin-18, thereby preventing growth and
proliferation of neighbouring NB cells in culture.
Recent findings suggest the following cascade of
events leading to the above described activation of both
the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in response
to LCA binding to the surface of BE(2)-m17 and SKn-MCIXC cells. The only known LCA receptor on the
cell surface in rodents and humans is TGR5, a member
of the G-protein coupled receptor family [169,170].
LCA is the most potent natural agonist of TGR5, with
EC50 of 530 nM [171,172]. Importantly, TGR5 has
been shown to be expressed in neurons [170,173-175].
LCA-stimulated TGR5 could initiate three molecular
cascades that trigger the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 8B). First, it could initiate
the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway known to response by
altering oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria
and mitochondrial morphology [169,170,176-178]. The
resulting changes in mitochondria may include such welldocumented effects of LCA as MOMP activation and
elevated ROS production [169,170,176-178]. Second,
the elevated in response to LCA intracellular ROS could
intensify vesicle-mediated trafficking of the CD95/Fas
death receptor monomers from the Golgi to the plasma
membrane, another well-documented effect of LCA in
human cells [179,180]. Third, LCA-stimulated TGR5
could activate the MEKK1/2/3-MKK4/7 protein kinase
cascade resulting in phosphorylation of c-Jun-N terminal
kinase (JNK). Such LCA/TGR5-driven phosphorylation
has been shown to release pro-caspase-8 from a complex
that it forms with unphosphorylated JNK, thereby
enabling its recruitment to the CD95/Fas death-inducing
signaling complex consisting of the CD95/Fas death
receptor trimers and the adaptor Fas-Associated Death
Domain [176,181]. Following pro-caspase-8 dimerization
and proteolytic processing, its active form could trigger
both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic death pathways
(Fig. 8A).

LCA modulates mitochondrial structure and
function to cause an anti-tumor effect in cultured
human NB cells and an anti-aging effect in
quiescent yeast

We are grateful to Dr. Tatiana Iouk (Concordia
University, Montreal) for sharing with us unpublished data
on the ability of LCA to slow down telomere shortening in
chronologically aging yeast. This study was supported by
funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research
(A.L. and T.A.A.H.), Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research Council of Canada (V.I.T.), and Concordia
University Chair Fund (V.I.T.). A.A.G. was supported
by a doctoral scholarship from the Canadian Institutes
of Health Research. A.B. was supported by a Master’s
scholarship from the Fonds de la recherche en santé du
Québec. V.I.T. is a Concordia University Research Chair
in Genomics, Cell Biology and Aging.

This study as well as our published [86] and recent
unpublished data suggest that both an anti-tumor effect
of LCA in cultured human NB cells and its longevityextending effect in quiescent yeast are due to its ability
to modulate mitochondria-confined processes playing
essential roles in both cancer and aging. Interestingly,
the effects of LCA on these mitochondrial processes
seen in NB cell cultures are opposite of those observed
in quiescent yeast and, for some processes, in primary
cultures of human neurons. Indeed, while LCA enhances
the susceptibility of NB cell lines BE(2)-m17 and SKn-MC to mitochondria-controlled apoptotic cell death
caused by exogenously added hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2),
it significantly increases the resistance of quiescent yeast
[86] and primary cultures of human neurons (Fig. 2) to
such a form of cell death. Furthermore, while LCA causes
the fragmentation of a tubular mitochondrial network
into individual mitochondria in BE(2)-m17 and SK-nMC (Figs. 4A and 4B), it attenuates such mitochondrial
fragmentation in quiescent yeast [86]. Moreover, LCA
triggers the complete dissipation of the electrochemical
potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane
in BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MC (Figs. 4C and 4D). In
contrast, although exposure of yeast cells to LCA causes a
reduction of such potential by 50% upon entry into a nonproliferative state [86], for a long time after becoming
quiescent these cells maintain higher mitochondrial
transmembrane potential than their quiescent counterparts
that have not been exposed to LCA (Beach et al.,
manuscript in preparation). To the best of our knowledge,
these findings provide the first example of a compound
that can kill cancer cells and increase longevity of noncancerous cells by causing quite opposite effects on the
same kind of mitochondria-confined processes in these
two different cell types. A key challenge for the future will
be to understand why mitochondria in cancer and noncancerous cells respond so differently to LCA exposure.

collected with a Nikon Eclipse (TE2000-U) inverted
fluorescence microscope under 20 × magnification. A filter
cube with an excitation wavelength of 330-380 nm was
used to visualize Hoechst-stained cells. Cells stained with
MitoTracker Red CMXRos or TMRE were visualized
using filter cubes with excitations of 590-650 nm or 532587 nm, respectively.

Cell viability assays

Caspase activity assays

The number of viable cells in cultures exposed to LCA
was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)-based CellTiter
96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI). In this assay, only viable, metabolically
active cells were able to reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt
of MTT to form a purple formazan product. This insoluble
product was solubilized by the addition of a detergent. The
resulting intracellular purple formazan was then detected
spectrophotometrically using a 96-well plate reader at
a wavelength of 570 nm. The signal was corrected to
account for cellular debris using a wavelength of 630
nm. Chromatin in cells exposed to LCA and/or hydrogen
peroxide and/or z-DEVD-fmk was visualized with the
fluorescent dye Hoechst used at a final concentration of
4 μM in culture media and viewed using fluorescence
microscopy. For each cell culture, the percentage of viable
non-apoptotic cells carrying intact, non-fragmented nuclei
containing non-condensed chromatin was calculated.
Dead apoptotic cells carried fragmented nuclei containing
condensed chromatin, a hallmark event of apoptotic death.

Proteins were extracted from harvested cells using
an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 0.1%
CHAPS, 0.1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors (0.1μg/
ml TLCK, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 38 mg/ml AEBSF, 0.1
μg/ml pepstatin A). The cell lysate was centrifuged at
13,000 × g for 5 min at 4oC to remove cell debris and
any detergent-insoluble proteins. The supernatant was
collected and frozen at -80oC. Extracts were thawed and
protein concentrations were quantified with the Pierce
BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
The extracts were then assayed for caspase activities
using fluorogenic substrates specific for caspase-1 (10
μM Ac-YVAD-AFC), caspase-3 (5 μM Ac-DEVD-AFC),
caspase-6 (10 μM Ac-VEID-AFC), caspase-8 (10 μM
Ac-IETD-AFC) or caspase-9 (10 μM Ac-LEHD-AFC) in
caspase reaction buffer (20  mM PIPES, pH 7.2, 30  mM
NaCl, 10  mM DTT, 1  mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10%
sucrose). The time-dependent release of the fluorescent
compound 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC)
was monitored using a Bio-Rad Fluoromark fluorometer
(Hercules, CA) at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and
an emission wavelength of 538  nm. Measurements were
recorded at 2 min intervals for 1 h. A standard curve of AFC
fluorescence was used to calculate AFC (in picomoles)
released in the reactions. Specific activities were expressed
as picomoles of AFC released per microgram of protein
per minute, based on the linear range of the curve.

Pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-6 cleavage assays

NEN; Boston, MA) was used to detect the target antigen/
antibody complexes. Blots were then stripped at 50o C for
30 min in a Tris-buffered 20% SDS/1% 2-mercaptoethanol
stripping solution, washed and reprobed with GAPDH
antibody to verify protein loading equivalency.

50 μg of protein from crude cellular extracts were
resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 15% polyacrylamide gel
and then transferred to a PVDF Immobilon-P membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). Following wash with 5%
milk, blots were incubated with primary antibodies
used at the following dilutions: 1:500 for anti-cleavedcaspase-3 p17 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), 1:250 for
anti-cleaved-caspase-6 p10 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA)
and 1:5,000 for anti-β-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MI). Immunoreactivity was visualized with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham,
Oakville, ON) that were used at dilutions 1:2,000 (for
anti-rabbit) and 1:5,000 (for anti-mouse), respectively.
Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence using an ECL plus chemiluminescence
Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).

Mass spectrometric measurement of LCA
Mass spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of
LCA was performed as previously reported [189]. In
brief, lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer
method [189] from cells pelleted by centrifugation for
5 min at 16,000 × g at 4oC and from the supernatant of
cultural medium. The extracted lipids were dried under
nitrogen and resuspended in chloroform. Immediately
prior to injection the extracted lipids were combined
with a 2:1 methanol:chloroform mixture supplemented
with 0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide. The sample was
injected directly into a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer
(Waters, Milford, MA) using a nano-ESI spray source at 1
µl/min. Spectra were obtained in a negative-ion mode. The
cone voltage was set to 30 v, the capillary voltage to 3.2
kv and the collision gas to 10 (arbitrary units). Acquired
spectra were centroided using the Masslynx software then
deconvoluted and deisotoped with Excel macros.

Histone H2AX phosphorylation assay
BC cells were removed from 100-mm tissue
culture dishes using a rubber policeman and ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were pelleted
by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at 4oC. The pellets were
resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0,1%
NP-40, 1× mammalian cell anti-protease cocktail (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MI)). The cells were lysed using
multiple freeze-thaw cycles followed by pulse sonication
on ice and centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 40
C to remove cell debris. Western blot analysis of these
protein lysates was performed as previously described
[188]. Briefly, equivalent amounts of protein (assessed
using Bio-Rad Protein Reagent; Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels.
Following electrophoresis the proteins were trans-blotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall-VWR International,
Radnor, PA). The membranes were blocked overnight at
4o C on a gyratory plate with 5% molecular grade skim
milk powder (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in
PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). Primary and
secondary antibody incubations and subsequent washes
were carried out in the same buffer. The antibody to
phosphorylated H2AX was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The primary antibody
for GAPDH was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St
Louis, MI). Secondary HRP antibodies were purchased
from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Blots were
immunoprobed overnight with primary antibodies used at
a 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary HRP antibody was applied
at room temperature on a gyratory plate at a 1:10,000
dilution for 30 min. Following multiple washes, an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (DuPontwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft
Excel’s (2010) Analysis ToolPack-VBA. All data are
presented as the means ± SD. The p values were calculated
using an unpaired two-tailed t test.
