ABSTRACT
The prognosis of metastatic breast cancer is always very poor. Thus, it is urgent
to develop novel drugs with less toxicity against metastatic breast cancer. A new
drug (XC-591) derived from benzothiazole-2-thiol was designed and synthesized in
our lab. In this study, we tried to assess effects of XC-591 treatment on primary
breast cancer and pulmonary metastasis in 4T1 mice model. Furthermore, we tried
to discover its possible molecular mechanism of action. MTT experiment showed
XC-591 had significant anti-cancer activity on diverse cancer cells. Furthermore,
XC-591 significantly suppressed the proliferation of 4T1 cells by colony formation
assay. The in vivo results displayed that XC-591 could inhibit the growth and
metastasis in 4T1 model. Moreover, histological analysis revealed that XC-591
treatment increased apoptosis, inhibited proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. In
addition, XC-591 did not contribute to obvious drug associated toxicity during the
whole study. Molecular mechanism showed XC-591 could inhibit RhoGDI, activate
caspase-3 and decrease phosphorylated Akt. The present data may be important to
further explore this kind of new small-molecule inhibitor.

safety and increasing anti-cancer efficacy, smallmolecule inhibitors are being deeply investigated as a
new treatment method.
Benzothiazole derivatives have diverse biological
functions, including anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant,
antimicrobial and antitumor activities [4, 5]. But previous
studies used 2-aminobenzothiazoles or 2-arylbenzothiazoles
to design benzothiazole derivatives. In our lab, we used the
benzothiazole-2-thiol as a functional group to develop a
new series of compounds. Among these small-molecule
compounds, XC-591 had obvious anti-tumor activity on
diverse cancer cells in vitro, which was more effective than
cisplatin (a platinum based chemotherapeutic drug) [6].
However, the exact anti-cancer effects of XC-591 in vivo
have not been reported. In this study, we attempted to

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer incidence and mortality have been
increasing in China. It has been estimated that 268,600
Chinese women developed breast cancer and 69,500
died of breast cancer in the year 2015 [1]. Therapeutic
options such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal
therapy, and targeted therapies are often used to treat
patients with breast cancer [2]. In the last decades, early
detection and proper treatment have helped reduce
breast cancer mortality. However, distant metastases are
still the main cause of breast cancer associated deaths
[3]. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel drugs with less
toxicity against metastatic breast cancer. Considering

breast cancer and pulmonary metastases. In addition,
possible molecular mechanism of action was also studied.

results about tumor weight were also observed. We found
the average weight of the tumors was decreased by 46.9%
and 71.8% in 50 mg/kg XC-591 treated group and 100 mg/
kg XC-591 treated group, respectively, when compared
with the untreated control (Figure 3B).

RESULTS

XC-591 inhibited the metastasis of 4T1 from the
primary site to lungs in vivo

RhoGDI was increased in cancer cells
Western blot was conducted to check RhoGDI
expression in cancer cell lines (including 4T1 and A549)
and normal cell lines (including MM3MG and HK2).
RhoGDI was obviously increased in two cancer cell lines,
when compared with two normal cells (Figure 1A).

As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, our data
showed that the untreated group had a median of 40.5
metastases/lungs (range, 28-56 metastases). However,
the median of 50 mg/kg XC-591 treated group was
only 19.5 metastases/lungs (range, 13–27 metastases).
Furthermore, mice treated with 100 mg/kg XC-591 had
a median of 6 metastases/lungs (range, 0–8 metastases).
More importantly, 3 mice with no visible lung metastases
were observed in the group treated with 100 mg/kg XC591 (Table 2). Thus, XC-591 could inhibit primary tumor
growth and distant metastases in 4T1 model.

The cytotoxicity effect of XC-591 on tumor cells
RhoGDI specific inhibitor XC-591 was synthesized
in our lab and the chemical structure was shown in Figure
1B. As shown in Table 1, XC-591 inhibited proliferation
of many cancer cells (including CT26, 4T1, LLC,
B16, MethA, A549, HeLa and DU145). Howerver, no
apparently toxicity on normal cells (including MM3MG,
HK2 and LO2) was observed (Table 1). Compared with
other tumor cells, 4T1 was more sensitive to XC-591 than
others and thus was selected for further study.

Inhibition of proliferation (PCNA) and increase
of apoptosis (TUNEL)
Tumor sections of each group were stained with
anti-PCNA antibody and TUNEL reagent in order to
evaluate proliferation and apoptosis rate. Compared
with the control group, XC-591 significantly decreased
percentages of PCNA-positive nuclei (Figure 5A&5B).
Meanwhile we could find a large area of necrosis in the
sections of both XC-591 treated groups (Figure 5A).
Moreover, in a concentration-dependent way, XC-591
increased percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei, when
compared with the untreated group (Figure 5C&5D).
Thus, XC-591 could directly inhibit proliferation and
induce apoptosis in vivo.

XC-591 suppressed proliferation of 4T1
Colony formation assay demonstrated that there was
a marked decrease in the colony number from 364±46.4
in the untreated 4T1 cells to 189±35.2 and 56±12,
respectively, in 1.25 and 2.5 μM XC-591 treated tumor
cells (P<0.05) (Figure 2). These results showed that the
proliferative activity of 4T1 cells was inhibited by XC-591
in a dose-dependent way.

Anti-tumor effect of XC-591 in vivo

XC-591 inhibited angiogenesis in vivo

As shown in Figure 3A, it is obvious that the
treatment with XC-591 resulted in primary tumor growth
regression of 48.5% and 79%, in 50 mg/kg XC-591 treated
group and 100 mg/kg XC-591 treated group respectively,
when compared with the untreated group. The similar

As shown in Figure 5E&5F, compared with the
untreated group with high MVD, lower MVD could be
observed in XC-591 treated groups. Thus, these data
showed that XC-591 could inhibit angiogenesis.

Toxicity assessment
To assess the possible adverse effects of XC-591,
weight of mice was monitored every 3 days during the
experiment. No weight changes were found after XC591 treatment (Figure 6). In addition, no ruffled fur or
toxic death was observed in the XC-591 treated groups.
Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, XC-591 treatment did
not contribute to blood toxicity and liver toxicity (P>0.05,
respectively).

expression level of RhoGDI was examined by western
blot after treatment with XC-591. As shown in Figure 7,
RhoGDI was inhibited obviously in the XC-591 treated
4T1 cells.
We investigated whether Akt was involved in
XC-591-mediated proliferation inhibitory effect. Our
result showed XC-591 clearly decreased phosphorylated
Akt (Figure 7). Furthermore, we attempted to study the
impact of XC-591 on the activation of caspase-3. XC-591
treatment contributed to an obvious increase of cleaved
caspase-3 (Figure 7).

and reduced phosphorylated Akt

small molecule targeted drugs, which target key proteins
of oncogenic pathways, have shown good effects in the
management of many cancers [7–9].
In this study, we attempted to study the biological
activities of XC-591, a new benzothiazole-2-thiol
derivative, in detail. XC-591 showed obvious antiproliferative activity on many cancer cells by MTT assay.

Compared with other tumor cells, murine mammary
tumor cell line 4T1 was more sensitive to XC-591 than
others and thus was chosen for further study. XC-591
administered p.o. displayed a marked antitumor activity in
4T1 tumor models. The histological analysis showed XC591 significantly reduced percentages of PCNA-positive
nuclei, increased percentages of TUNEL positive nuclei

and inhibited angiogenesis in a concentration-dependent
way. During the whole experiment, no potential toxicity
induced by XC-591 treatment was observed. In addition,
in order to further study the molecular mechanism, we
used western blot to examine the expression level of
RhoGDI (predicted drug target protein), cleaved caspase-3
and phosphorylated Akt. The data showed that XC-591
could inhibit RhoGDI, activate caspase-3 and reduce
phosphorylated Akt.
Rho family GTPases work in diverse cellular
functions, including morphology, migration, gene
transcription and cell cycle [10]. RhoGDI can inhibit
nucleotide exchange and membrane association to downregulate activities of Rho family GTPases [11]. RhoGDI
is overexpressed in diverse human cancers, including
lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and breast cancer
[12–14]. The increased RhoGDI is associated with
radiochemotherapy resistance and poor progonosis [15].
For example, a comparative proteomic study showed that
RhoGDI was increased in oral squamous cell carcinoma

and validated as an independent prognostic factor [16].
Furthermore, RhoGDI was identified as a metastasisassociated protein in colon and prostate cancer [17].
In addition, it has been reported that RhoGDI could
stimulate the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor
α(ERα) via a RhoGTPase-dependent pathway that acts on
estrogen receptor co-activators GRIP1 and CBP/p300 in
breast cancer [18]. RhoGDI1 could increase both liganddependent and -independent ERα activity in breast cancer
[19]. Thus, RhoGDI is a very promising anti-cancer target
protein in breast cancer.
The important role of RhoGDI in tumor growth
is supported by a number of important experimental
observations. The suppression of RhoGDI alone by
siRNA has a profound inhibitory effect on the growth of
hepatocellular carcinoma [20]. Overexpressed RhoGDI
can inhibit the induction of apoptosis by cytotoxic
drugs in breast cancer cells. Silencing of RhoGDI by
siRNA can increase the sensitivity of chemotherapy
drugs, such as etoposide, doxorubicin and so on

and in vivo. The molecular mechanism study showed that
XC-591 could inhibit its target protein RhoGDI, and thus

The present data may be useful for further exploration
of this new small-molecule inhibitor in the treatment of
breast cancer.

[21, 22]. These findings mentioned above showed that
it is a good method to treat cancer by down-regulating
RhoGDI. However, until now, no specific RhoGDI
small molecule inhibitors have been designed and
studied.
In conclusion, we developed a new benzothiazole2-thiol derivative called XC-591. It showed good

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CA, USA). The primary antibody for CD31 was purchased
from Abcam (ab28364, Abcam, Cambridge, United
Kingdom). According to instructions of the Envision
System-HRP method (DakoCytomation Inc, Carpinteria,
CA, USA), tumor sections were stained.

Cell culture
Mouse colon carcinoma cell line CT26, mouse
mammary tumor cell line 4T1, mouse Lewis lung
carcinoma cell line LLC, mouse melanoma cell line
B16, mouse fibrosarcoma cell line MethA, human lung
carcinoma cell line A549, human cervical cancer cell line
HeLa, human prostate cancer cell line DU145, mouse
mammary normal epithelial cell line MM3MG and human
normal kidney cell line HK2 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
Human normal liver cell line LO2 was purchased from
Cell biology of shanghai institute, shanghai, china. They
were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Bedford,
MA, USA) or RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies).

TUNEL assay
According to the instructions, TUNEL (terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nickend labeling) was completed to assess the percentage
of apoptotic cells within tumors. Percent apoptosis was
determined by counting the number of apoptotic cells and
dividing by the total number of cells in the field (5 high
power fields/slide).

Toxicity assessment
To study the potential side effects in the XC-591 treated
mice, they were continuously observed for relevant indexes
such as weight loss, ruffled fur, diarrhea, anorexia, skin
ulcer or toxic deaths. After sacrificed, various organs (lung,
liver, kidney, heart, and spleen) were stained with H&E, and
observed by two pathologists in a blinded manner. The levels
of serum ALT and AST were determined with an automatic
multifunction-biochemical analyzer. Complete blood counts
and differentials were measured within each sample using
an Abbott CELL-DYN 3700 hematology analyzer (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).

Synthesis of XC-591
The route adapted for the synthesis of compound
XC-591 was reported before [6].

MTT assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for
24 h, followed by XC-591 treatment for 48 h. According
to the instructions, MTT was done as reported before [6].

Colony formation assay

Western blot

4T1 cells were plated and then treated with 0, 1.25
and 2.5μM of XC-591, respectively. After 7-10 days of
incubation, the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet
in absolute ethanol and colonies were counted under
dissection microscope.

The western blot was done as previously described
[7]. The primary antibodies for RhoGDI and Akt/p-Akt
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA, USA). The primary antibodies for caspase-3 and
GAPDH were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

In vivo tumor experiment

Statistical analysis

To study the antitumor activities of XC-591 in vivo, 4T1
mice mammary tumor metastatic models were established. In
brief, 1 × 105 4T1 cells were subcutaneously injected into the
right dorsal flank of 6 to 8 weeks old female BALB/c mice.
The tumor-bearing mice were randomly put into the following
three groups (ten mice per treatment group) and each
mouse received the corresponding treatment by intragastric
administration once daily: (a) control group; (b) XC-591,
50 mg/kg; (c) XC-591, 100 mg/kg. Tumor volumes were
evaluated according to the following formula: tumor volume
(mm3) = 0.52 × length × width2. After sacrificed, tumor net
weight was weighed. Autopsy was performed to assess the
number and diameter of the metastatic nodules of lung.

Statistical analysis of the differences in tumor volume,
tumor net weight, animal weight, percentages of apoptosis,
percentages of PCNA-positive nuclei and microvessel
density were done using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis of the differences in pulmonary
metastasis was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
