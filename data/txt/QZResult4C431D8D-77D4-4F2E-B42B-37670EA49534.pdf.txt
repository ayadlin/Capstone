Abstract
A poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) patients is commonly associated with the presence of
regional metastasis. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy is commonly used in the treatment
of locally advanced HNSCC. However, the result is dismal due
to common acquisition of chemoresistance and radioresistance. Epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of
dietary substances in the prevention of HNSCC. Here, we found
that lupeol, a triterpene found in fruits and vegetables,
selectively induced substantial HNSCC cell death but exhibited
only a minimal effect on a normal tongue fibroblast cell line
in vitro. Down-regulation of NF-KB was identified as the major
mechanism of the anticancer properties of lupeol against
HNSCC. Lupeol alone was not only found to suppress tumor
growth but also to impair HNSCC cell invasion by reversal of
the NF-KB–dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Lupeol exerted a synergistic effect with cisplatin, resulting in
chemosensitization of HNSCC cell lines with high NF-KB
activity in vitro. In in vivo studies, using an orthotopic
metastatic nude mouse model of oral tongue squamous cell
carcinoma, lupeol at a dose of 2 mg/animal dramatically
decreased tumor volume and suppressed local metastasis,
which was more effective than cisplatin alone. Lupeol exerted
a significant synergistic cytotoxic effect when combined with
low-dose cisplatin without side effects. Our results suggest
that lupeol may be an effective agent either alone or in
combination for treatment of advanced tumors. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth
most common human neoplasm, with an estimated annual
worldwide incidence of 500,000 new cases (1, 2). Despite advancements in surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and combinations of
treatment modalities, the long-term survival of patients with
HNSCC has remained 50% for the past 30 years (3). Therefore,
investigations of potential alternative treatments for HNSCC with
greater efficacy and fewer associated toxicities are urgently needed.

Human papilloma virus infection and alcohol and tobacco use
are each known to play a role in the pathogenesis of HNSCC (4).
Further, the combined effects of alcohol and tobacco use have a
multiplicative risk in the development of HNSCC (5, 6). Cigarette
smoke and alcohol consumption can cause significant oxidative
stress (7, 8), which increases DNA damage (9) and, consequently,
leads to the malignant transformation of normal cells (10).
Epidemiologic studies have attributed the lower incidence of
HNSCC in the United States to the high intake of fruits and
vegetables, suggesting that some dietary substances have a
protective effect against HNSCC (11, 12). In recent years,
substances obtained from fruits and vegetables have gained
considerable attention for the prevention and/or treatment of
certain cancers (13–15). Lup-20(29)-en-3h-ol (lupeol), a triterpene
found in fruits (e.g., olive, mango, strawberry, grapes, and figs),
vegetables, and medicinal plants, recently showed antitumor
activity in a two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis and
apoptotic effects in androgen-dependent prostate carcinomas
(16, 17). Lupeol possesses strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antiarthritic, antimutagenic, and antimalarial activities in in vitro
and in vivo systems by inhibiting Ras and Fas signaling pathways
(18–21). It has also been shown that lupeol induces differentiation
and inhibits growth of mouse melanoma and human leukemia cells
(22, 23). In view of the wide range of pharmacologic activities of
lupeol, we exploited the therapeutic efficacy of lupeol in the
treatment of HNSCC.
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy was commonly used in the treatment of locally advanced
HNSCC (24). However, the result is unsatisfactory due to the
acquisition of chemoresistance by tumor cells. Multiple mechanisms for chemoresistance have been described in various cancer
cells (25–27). Chemotherapeutic compounds that induce apoptosis
are also known to activate nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) in the
protection of genotoxic stress. However, the role of NF-nB–related
chemoresistance remains open and controversial (28). Therefore,
we set out first to understand the molecular mechanism governing
the chemoresistance of HNSCC and then to examine the potential
chemosensitization effect of lupeol in combination with cisplatin
treatment with the aim of developing an effective treatment for this
deadly disease.
In the present study, lupeol selectively induced substantial
HNSCC cell death and exhibited minimal effects on a normal
tongue epithelial cell line in vitro. In vitro, down-regulation of
NF-nB is the major mechanism of the anticancer properties of
lupeol against HNSCC, as indicated by chemosensitization of the
tongue carcinoma cell line CAL27. We observed that lupeol dramatically decreased tumor volume and suppressed local metastasis in

our animal model. Cisplatin alone did not satisfactorily shrink the
tumor and it resulted in toxicity by causing a decrease in body
weight. Combination therapy consisting of a low dose of cisplatin
and lupeol showed a synergistic effect on the suppression of tumor
growth and metastasis, accompanied by inhibition of NF-nB
without toxicity. Our results provide solid evidence that lupeol
may be a novel therapeutic agent that is clinically applicable for the
treatment of cancers in which NF-nB plays a significant role.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The human oral squamous cell carcinoma
cell lines TU159 and MDA1986 were obtained from the laboratory of Dr.
Gary L. Clayman (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX; ref. 29). The tongue fibroblast cell line Hs 677.Tg (CRL-7408)
and the human tongue carcinoma cell line CAL27 were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were maintained in
DMEM with high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 mg/mL
penicillin G, and 50 Ag/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Plasmids. IKKhWT was provided by Dr. D.Y. Jin (Department of
Biochemistry, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; ref. 30).
Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies against h-actin, NF-nB/p50, NFnB/p65, histone H, Sm-actin, and vimentin were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Antibodies to E-cadherin and a-cadherin were purchased
from Zymed Laboratories. Antibodies against caspase-3 and cleaved
caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Lupeol was
purchased from Sigma. Cisplatin was purchased from David Bull
Laboratories.
Treatment of cells. A stock solution of lupeol (30 mmol/L; MW, 426.72)
was prepared by resuspension in warm alcohol and dilution in DMSO at a
1:1 ratio. For dose-dependent studies, the cells (50% confluent) were treated
with lupeol (1–30 Amol/L) for 48 h in complete cell medium. The final
concentrations of DMSO and alcohol were 0.25% and 0.075%, respectively, in
all treatment protocols. After 48 h of treatment with lupeol, the cells were
harvested and cell lysates were prepared and stored at 80jC for later use.
Cell transfection. For transient transfection, CAL27 cells were transfected with 2 Ag of plasmid IKKhWT or empty vector as a control using
FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche). For generation
of CAL27 cells harboring luciferase, a lentiviral vector harboring the
luciferase gene was constructed and transfected using the Lentiviral RNAi
Expression System (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were generated from a
pool of >20 positive clones, which were selected with blasticidin at a
concentration of 2 Ag/mL.
Immunofluorescence. Cells cultured on chamber slides were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
The cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody against E-cadherin.
The secondary antibody was TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes), and the cells were counterstained with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole. For phalloidin staining, the same fixation
procedure was used as described above except that cells were incubated
with fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in 1% bovine serum albumin
(dilution factor of 1:50) at 37jC for 1 h. All images were visualized by
confocal microscopy and photographs were taken at 600 magnification.
Cell cycle analysis. After lupeol treatment, the DNA content and cell
cycle distribution of CAL27 cells grown in six-well plates were determined
by flow cytometry. The cells were plated at a low density (5  104 per well)
and were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Another set of controls that
lacked lupeol treatment was used. Cells were trypsinized and washed once
in PBS. They were then fixed in cold 70% ethanol and stored at 4jC. Before
testing, ethanol was removed and the cells were resuspended in PBS. The
fixed cells were then washed with PBS, treated with RNase (1 Ag/mL), and
stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) for 30 min at 37jC. Cell cycle
analysis was done in an EPICS profile analyzer using ModFit LT2.0 software
(Coulter Electronics).

Immunostaining. Immunohistochemistry was done as previously
described (31). To detect NF-nB/p65 and E-cadherin, the antibodies
described above were used.
Luciferase promoter assay. Cells were plated onto 24-well culture
plates and allowed to grow for 24 h; the NF-nB-luciferase–based construct
and pRL-CMV-Luc were cotransfected into CAL27 cells using FuGENE 6
reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection and
were assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after
transfection and the reading was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity,
which served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Each
experiment was done at least thrice in duplicate wells and each data point
represented the mean and SD. The mean percentage increase (or decrease)
in luciferase activity was presented as the final result and the SD of the
means was used as the error bar.
Western blot. The Western blots were developed using the enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and was done with the
antibodies described previously (32).
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
CAL27, TU159, MDA1986, and CRL-7408 were seeded onto 96-well plates
and appropriate concentrations of lupeol, ranging from 5 to 125 Amol/L, or
cisplatin, ranging from 0.2 to 5 Ag/mL, were then added. After 4 to 24 h,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye, at
a concentration of 5 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), was added and the plates were
incubated for 12 h in a moist chamber at 37jC. Absorbance was determined
by eluting the dye with DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and the absorbance was
measured at 570 nm. At least three independent experiments were done.
Quantification of apoptosis. The terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique was
done to detect apoptotic cells using the in situ cell death detection kit
(Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissues were fixed with
15 Ag/mL proteinase K in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The slides were then
incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37jC. After washing,
the slides were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antifluorescein antibody for 30 min at 37jC. For cytofluorometric apoptosis
analysis, CAL27 cells (5  105) were inoculated into each well of a six-well
plate and treated with 1% DMSO and different doses (1, 5, and 10 Amol/L)
of lupeol in 10% fetal bovine serum-DMEM for 48 h. The cells were
then labeled with Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and
analyzed with FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems).
Unstained cells were used as a negative control.
Wound healing assay and invasion assay. Cell migration was assessed
by measuring the movement of cells into a scraped acellular area created by
a 200-AL pipette tip (time 0) and the speed of wound closure was monitored
after 24 h. Invasion assays were done with 24-well BioCoat Matrigel
Invasion Chambers (Becton Dickinson) using 5  104 cells in serum-free
DMEM that were plated onto either control or Matrigel-coated filters.
Conditioned medium from CAL27 cells was placed in the lower chambers
as a chemoattractant. After 22 h in culture, cells were removed from the
upper surface of the filter by scraping with a cotton swab. Cells that had
invaded through the Matrigel and were adherent to the bottom of the
membrane were stained with crystal violet solution. The cell-associated dye
was eluted with 10% acetic acid and the resultant absorbance at 595 nm
was determined. Each experiment was done in triplicate and the mean
values (F SE) are presented.
Animal studies. A total of 5  105 CAL27 cells were harvested from
subconfluent cultures and injected directly into anterior tongue using a
1-mL tuberculin syringe (Hamilton Co.). A week later, the nude mice were
randomized into four groups and each group consisted of 10 nude mice.
They were treated with i.p. injection of lupeol (2 mg/animal) in 0.2 mL of
corn oil, 5 mg/kg cisplatin, lupeol (2 mg/animal) plus 1 mg/kg cisplatin,
or corn oil alone as the control group, twice per week for 30 days. The
administration protocol of lupeol was followed according to Saleem et al.
(16, 17).
Animal charge-coupled device experiments. A total of 5  105
CAL27-luciferase–expressing cells in 30-AL HBSS were injected directly into
the anterior tongue using a 1-mL tuberculin syringe (Hamilton Co.) with a

Figure 1. Lupeol selectively induced cell death of HNSCC cell lines. Cytotoxicity of CRL-7408, TU159, CAL27, and MDA1986 cells following lupeol treatment.
To evaluate drug sensitivity, the MTT assay was done in cells at 48 h after lupeol treatment. A, lupeol treatment induced dramatic cell death in HNSCC cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner. B, flow cytometry analysis of CAL27 cells following lupeol treatment. The cells were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment with an
IC10 dose of lupeol. CAL27 cells exhibited G1 arrest in a dose-dependent manner. C, the effect of lupeol on apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V staining after
treatment of CAL27 cells at doses of 15, 20, 25, and 30 Amol/L. The percentage of cell apoptosis increased in a dose-dependent manner at 8.59%, 11.44%, 24.91%,
and 27.62%, respectively, as detected by Annexin staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.

30-gauge hypodermic needle. The mice were imaged on days 0, 7, and 37
after tumor inoculation. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine
mix (4:1). Imaging was done using a Xenogen IVIS 100 cooled chargecoupled device (CCD) camera (Xenogen). The mice were injected i.p. with
200 AL of 15 mg/mL D-luciferin for 15 min before imaging, after which they
were placed in a light-tight chamber. The acquisition time ranged from 3 s
to 1 min. The images shown are pseudoimages of the emitted light in
photons/s/cm2/Sr, superimposed over the gray-scale photographs of the
animal.
Histologic analysis. Sections of different tissues (4 Am) were cut and
stained with H&E as previously described (32).
Statistical analysis. Continuous data were expressed as median and
range and compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.
Categorical variables were compared using the m2 test (or Fisher’s exact test
where appropriate). A Pearson test was used for bivariate correlation
comparison. All statistical analyses were done using statistical software
(SPSS 9.0 for Windows, SPSS, Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Growth inhibition of HNSCC cell lines with lupeol. CAL27 is a
tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, whereas TU159 and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

MDA1986 are primary and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma
cell lines, respectively. A human tongue fibroblast cell line, CRL7408, served as the control. The MTT assay was done to determine
its IC10 and IC50 doses. The MTT assay showed that lupeol
treatment induced dramatic cell death in HNSCC cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). There was no significant
difference in drug sensitivity (IC10 range, 13.7–22.2 Amol/L) among
the three HNSCC cell lines (CAL27, MDA1986, and TU159). To
examine its toxicity, the effect of lupeol on CRL-7408 cells was also
investigated. The results showed that CRL-7408 is less sensitive to
lupeol, with an IC10 up to 41.2 Amol/L. The effect of lupeol on cell
cycle distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry. When lupeol
was administered at the IC10 dose, CAL27 cells exhibited G1 arrest
( from 53.2% to 69.9%) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The
effect of lupeol on cell apoptosis was evaluated by cytofluorometric
apoptosis analysis. Lupeol induced CAL27 cell apoptosis at doses
that ranged from 15 to 30 Amol/L in CAL27 cells (Fig. 1C). The effect
of lupeol on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in another HNSCC
cell line, MDA1986, was found to be similar (data not shown).

Lupeol Suppressed Tumor Growth and Metastasis in HNSCC

mediated through inhibition of NF-nB, we first examined the
NF-nB promoter activity in CRL-7408 and three HNSCC cell lines
(TU159, MDA1986, and CAL27). By promoter assay, CAL27 showed
the highest NF-nB activity whereas CRL-7408 showed the lowest
(Fig. 2A). NF-nB promoter activity was evaluated in CAL27 and
MDA1986 cells with the highest NF-nB activity treated with lupeol
at the dose of IC10 for different time periods ( from 6 to 48 h;
Fig. 2B). There was a dramatic decrease in NF-nB after 6 h, which
was correlated with increased growth inhibition shown in Fig. 1B.
Consistently, decreased nuclear p65 and p50 protein levels
accompanied by inhibition of InBa phosphorylation were found
by Western blot (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the central role of

NF-nB in lupeol-induced growth suppression, we transiently
transfected CAL27 and MDA1986 cells with either empty vector
or IKKhWT and examined the difference in the effects of lupeol on
growth suppression. As expected, NF-nB promoter activity was
increased f3.5- and 3.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 2D). By MTT assay,
IC10 and IC50 were increased in IKKhWT when compared with the
empty vector control, suggesting that InBa phosphorylation plays a
central role in growth suppression of CAL27 and MDA1986 cells
(Fig. 2D).
Lupeol and cisplatin synergistically inhibited cell growth
through inhibition of NF-KB activity. Given the potential role of
NF-nB in chemoresistance of some tumor types (28), we examined

Figure 2. Lupeol induced cell death by down-regulation of NF-nB activity. The NF-nB activity in various HNSCC cell lines was evaluated by a promoter assay. A, of the
three HNSCC cell lines, NF-nB activity was found to be highest in CAL27. All three HNSCC cell lines exhibited elevated NF-nB expression when compared with the
normal tongue fibroblast cell line. There is an f13-fold increase in NF-nB activity in CAL27 cells when compared with CRL-7408 cells. B, by a promoter assay,
lupeol was found to inhibit NF-nB promoter activity in CAL27 and MDA1986 cells in a time-dependent manner at the IC10 dose. C, consistently, nuclear p65 and p50
protein levels were decreased in a time-dependent manner with inhibition of InB phosphorylation. Either empty vector or IKKhWT was transfected into CAL27 and
MDA1986 cells. D, IKKhWT transfection into CAL27 and MDA1986 cells conferred resistance to lupeol treatment when compared with the empty vector control.

Figure 3. Lupeol exerted a synergistic effect with cisplatin in the treatment of HNSCC cells with high NF-nB activity. A, IC10, IC30, and IC50 of CAL27 and MDA1986
cells in response to cisplatin treatment were determined by MTT assay. B, effects of lupeol, cisplatin, and their combination on the growth of CAL27 and MDA1986

mean from three individual experiments done in duplicate; bars, SD. Differences in cell growth after exposure to lupeol and cisplatin, alone and in combination,
were determined with the one-way ANOVA test. *, P < 0.05. C, cisplatin increased NF-nB promoter activity together with an increase in nuclear p65 and p50 protein
when CAL27 cells were treated with an IC10 dose of lupeol at different time points, but cleaved caspase-3 was not detected. When exposed to both lupeol and
cisplatin, NF-nB activity was found to decrease from 12 h after treatment, with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein.

whether lupeol sensitized the effect of cisplatin. First, we
determined the IC10 and IC30 of CAL27 and MDA1986 cells in
response to cisplatin by the MTT assay. Cisplatin was found to
inhibit CAL27 and MDA1986 cell growth in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3A). The respective treatments of CAL27 and
MDA1986 cells that have high levels of NF-nB activity were either
cisplatin (0.15 and 0.57 Ag/AL; 0.21 and 0.68 Ag/AL) or lupeol (13.7
and 32.3 Amol/L; 15.1 and 36.4 Amol/L). These treatments resulted
in 10% to 30% inhibition of cell growth. When lupeol and cisplatin
were combined at their IC30 doses, growth was inhibited by 88%
and 80% in CAL27 and MDA1986 cells, respectively. This effect was
similar to that exerted by an 8.4-fold and 6.2-fold higher
concentration of cisplatin (4.8 and 4.2 Ag/mL, respectively;
Fig. 3B). A weaker effect was seen in TU159 cells that showed
low NF-nB activity (data not shown). The CAL27 cell line was
chosen to study whether lupeol and cisplatin synergistically
inhibited cell growth through inhibition of NF-nB activity. In
Fig. 3C, it is shown that cisplatin induced NF-nB activity of CAL27

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

cells in a time-dependent manner. Cisplatin increased NF-nB
promoter activity from 6 to 48 h at the IC10 dose, accompanied by
an increase in nuclear p65 and p50 protein levels. At the IC10 dose,
cleaved caspase-3 was barely detectable. When lupeol and cisplatin
were combined, NF-nB promoter activity decreased from 6 to 48 h.
Consistently, nuclear p65 and p50 protein levels decreased in a
time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was evidenced by an increased
cleaved caspase-3 protein level at 24 h after combined treatment
with lupeol and cisplatin.
Lupeol suppressed cell motility and invasiveness by reversal
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Increased invasion and
cell motility is a major factor contributing to a poor prognosis of
HNSCC (2). To examine the antimetastatic effect of lupeol on
CAL27 and MDA1986 cells, we carried out assays for wound healing
and invasion. As shown in Fig. 4A, similarly sized wounds were
introduced into monolayers of CAL27 and MDA1986 cells at 0 h. In
the control cells, the gap of the wound was filled gradually by
migrating cells, and at 24 h after wound induction, the gap was

almost closed (solid arrow). In contrast, after exposure to lupeol at
doses ranging from 5 to 15 Amol/L, the speed of wound closure was
much slower and the wound was still widely open at 24 h after
exposure. As the speed of wound closure reflects the migration
ability of cancer cells, these results indicate that lupeol treatment
inhibits cell migration. Lupeol also exhibited a dramatic effect on
the suppression of cell invasion. As indicated by an invasion assay,
lupeol suppressed cell invasion by 1.7- to 6.6-fold and by 1.69- to
5.05-fold at doses ranging 5 to 15 Amol/L in CAL27 and MDA1986
cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). Cell motility is dependent on
rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in invasive cells (33). In
the untreated CAL27 cells, bundles of actin filaments were well
organized as evidenced by the strong staining of stress fiber
formation, intact network, and protruding morphology (Fig. 4C).
However, after exposure of CAL27 cells to lupeol, a reduction and
disruption of the actin stress fiber network and a lack of filopodia
were observed (Fig. 4C). EMT, transdifferentiation from epithelial
type to mesenchymal phenotype, is one of the major events during
acquisition of the invasive phenotype in tumors of epithelial origin
(34, 35). This process is often accompanied by expression of
mesenchymal markers and loss of epithelial markers, especially
E-cadherin (36–38). We therefore studied whether the inhibitory
effect of lupeol on cell invasion of CAL27 and MDA1986 cells was

mediated through reversal of EMT. We found that the morphology
of lupeol-treated cells changed from a more elongated fibroblastlike morphology to a round and packed appearance of epithelial
cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, expression of epithelial markers such
as E-cadherin and g-cadherin was increased by lupeol at IC10
concentrations in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). In contrast,
expression of mesenchymal markers such as a-smooth muscle
actin and vimentin was reduced (Fig. 5B). Most importantly, we
found intense membrane staining of E-cadherin in lupeol-treated
HNSCC cells compared with the controls, indicating activation of
this protein, whereas weakly positive E-cadherin staining was
mainly observed in the cytoplasm of untreated controls (Fig. 5C).
IKKBWT abolishes lupeol-induced chemosensitization and
EMT reversal. To examine whether down-regulation of NF-nB is
the major mechanism for lupeol-induced chemosensitization and
reversal of EMT, we also transfected CAL27 cells with an NF-nB
activator, IKKhWT, to examine whether the effect of lupeol can be
reversed. Introduction of IKKhWT stimulated NF-nB activity by
3.5-fold as described above. The expression of IKKhWT abolished
the chemosensitization effect of lupeol. Cleaved caspase-3 was
observed at 48 h after the addition of both cisplatin and lupeol at
IC10 doses to CAL27 control cells, but it was absent in IKKhWT
transfectants (Supplementary Fig. S1). To examine whether

Figure 4. Lupeol suppressed cell motility and invasion of HNSCC cells in vitro. Similarly sized wounds were introduced into confluent monolayers of cells and
various concentrations of lupeol were added. The speed of wound closure was monitored at 24 h. Note that the speed of wound closure was suppressed by lupeol in
CAL27 and MDA1986 cells in a dose-dependent manner (A ). In addition, the effect of lupeol on cell invasiveness was evaluated by a Matrigel invasion assay.
Suppression of cell invasion was also observed in a dose-dependent manner following lupeol treatment (B ). The effect of lupeol on stress fiber formation was evaluated
by phalloidin staining. Lupeol treatment destroyed the actin network and reduced the protrusion ability of CAL27 cells.

reversal of EMT by lupeol is NF-nB dependent, we examined
alternations of both epithelial and mesenchymal markers in either
pcDNA-CAL27 or IKKhWT-CAL27 transfectants after 48 h of
lupeol administration at the IC10 dose. By Western blot, there were
no apparent changes in epithelial or mesenchymal markers in
IKKhWT-CAL27 transfectants, suggesting that lupeol-induced
reversal of EMT is NF-nB dependent (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Combined lupeol and cisplatin treatment significantly
suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic
metastatic nude mouse model of HNSCC. The in vivo
therapeutic effect of lupeol was examined using the metastatic
orthotopic tongue carcinoma nude mouse model. Based on the
significant correlation between CCD camera signal and tumor size
in vivo (39), the CCD camera provided a novel and noninvasive tool
for evaluation of tumor size in vivo. CAL27 cells were first stably
transduced with the luciferase gene by lentiviral infection and
5  105 cells were injected directly into the anterior tongue of nude
mice, as shown in Fig. 6A. On day 37 after tumor inoculation, local
invasion of the lower jaw and regional lymph node metastasis
developed and were detected by CCD camera (Fig. 6A). To confirm
local invasion and regional metastasis, the animals were sacrificed
and dissected (Fig. 6B). The tissues of the lower jaw and lymph
node were further examined by H&E staining, which showed
massive tumor cell infiltration into these tissues (Fig. 6B). Using
this animal model, we examined the effect of lupeol alone and in

combination with cisplatin using continuous lupeol administration
at a dose of 2 mg/animal (group B), cisplatin alone (5 mg/kg; group
C), lupeol (2 mg/animal) + cisplatin (1 mg/kg; group D), or corn
oil (group A) as a control. The treatment began 7 days after the
orthotopic implantation of CAL27 cells (Fig. 6C). During the experiment, there was a significant decrease in body weight in the
control group (15 F 2.4 g) and cisplatin alone group (15.2 F 3.2 g)
when compared with the lupeol (23.9 F 2.5 g) and lupeol +
cisplatin (22.9 F 3.2 g) groups. This result indicated that both
lupeol-treated and lupeol combined with low-dose cisplatin groups
showed no signs of toxicity (infection, diarrhea, or loss of body
weight). Histologic sections of normal organs like tongue, heart,
liver, spleen, lung, and kidney showed no substantial cell death
after H&E staining (data not shown). The tumor volumes in these
four groups of animals were documented with a CCD camera.
Figure 6C shows the optical CCD signals from representative
groups on day 30 after treatment and Fig. 6D shows graphs of the
results from cohorts using the same photonic scale. Lupeol was
found to decrease the tumor volume significantly in a manner that
is much more effective than cisplatin treatment (P < 0.05). Lupeol
exerted a synergistic effect with low-dose cisplatin resulting in
dramatic shrinkage of the tumor. By TUNEL assay, there was a
remarkable difference in the number of apoptotic nuclei and
patchy necrosis in tumor tissues treated with lupeol (Supplementary Fig. S2B) when compared with the untreated samples

Lupeol Suppressed Tumor Growth and Metastasis in HNSCC

(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Combined lupeol and cisplatin treatment significantly induced tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis when
compared with cisplatin alone (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D).
Lupeol not only shrunk the tumor volume but also suppressed local
invasion of jaw and nodal metastasis. Five of five nude mice
exhibited local invasion of the jaw and/or nodal metastasis in the
control group. However, an absence of jaw invasion and nodal
metastasis was found in both lupeol and lupeol + cisplatin groups.
Although cisplatin can exert a limited apoptotic effect on tumor
cells, two of five nude mice exhibited local metastasis. From our
in vitro study, we found that lupeol suppressed NF-nB–dependent
EMT. By immunostaining, NF-nB expression was found to be
abundant in both the nucleus (active form) and cytoplasm in the
control group (Supplementary Fig. S3). After lupeol treatment, less
nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of NF-nB protein was observed in
the CAL27 treatment group (Supplementary Fig. S3). Accompanied
with decreased NF-nB protein in the treatment group, increased
membranous staining of E-cadherin was also observed, which
indicates a functionally active protein (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
Despite multiple modalities of treatment, such as surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy, head and neck cancers continue to

have one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (3). The recent
preclinical success of green tea in growth suppression of HNSCC
cell lines suggested the potential use of dietary substances in the
treatment of HNSCC (40). The major advantage of dietary
substances over the conventional chemotherapy is its minimal
toxicity to the body. In addition, natural agents that induce
apoptosis may provide an opportunity for minimal acquired drug
resistance and decreased mutagenesis (41). In the present study, we
found that lupeol effectively and selectively inhibited cellular
proliferation of head and neck cancer in vitro and in vivo. Used
alone or in combination with cisplatin, lupeol induced tumor cell
apoptosis and suppressed metastasis through modulation of NF-nB
activity and was well tolerated in mice.
A striking observation from Fig. 1A suggests a selective response
of HNSCC cell lines to lupeol compared with CRL-7408 cells. Our
data are significant because, in recent years, emphasis has been
placed on natural diet-based agents that selectively or preferentially eliminate cancer cells by inhibiting cell cycle progression
and/or by causing apoptosis. Studies have shown that inhibition of
NF-nB could result in suppression of tumor growth (28, 42). One
major mechanism of NF-nB activation is through inhibition of InB
phosphorylation (43). Lupeol prevented this phosphorylation and
thus resulted in reduced NF-nB activation. Our data support the

idea that lupeol exerts its effects in HNSCC through inhibition of
the NF-nB pathway. This finding explains the selective elimination
of HNSCC cells, which showed elevated NF-nB activity when
compared with normal tongue fibroblast cells.
Recent data suggested that chemotherapy including cisplatin
activates the NF-nB activity, which results in chemoresistance (28).
To test this hypothesis experimentally in HNSCC, we examined
NF-nB activity in CAL27 cells on cisplatin treatment. Interestingly,
cisplatin was able to increase NF-nB promoter activity in a timedependent manner, accompanied with an increase in nuclear p65
and p50 protein levels. Activation of NF-nB by cisplatin could
contribute to the acquired chemoresistance of HNSCC to cisplatin
in a clinical situation (44). The role of NF-nB in chemoresistance of
HNSCC to cisplatin was further confirmed by transfection of
IKKhDN into CAL27 cells, resulting in chemosensitization (data
not shown). In Fig. 3B, lupeol synergistically augmented the growth
inhibitory effect of cisplatin. The underlying mechanism most
probably involves down-regulation of NF-nB activity. The role of
NF-nB in lupeol-induced chemosensitization was further confirmed by transfection of IKKhWT into CAL27 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). This finding provided solid confirmation that lupeol
can potentially be used for combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation that activate the NF-nB activity.
Recently, NF-nB was shown to be involved in tumor progression
via EMT, a central process governing both morphogenesis (45) and
carcinoma progression in multicellular organisms (31). Due to the
inhibitory effect of lupeol on NF-nB activation, we examined
whether lupeol inhibited CAL27 cell motility and invasion by
suppression of NF-nB–dependent EMT. In Fig. 4A and B, lupeol
inhibited cell motility and invasion in a dose-dependent manner,
which is supported by disruption of F-actin structure. Accompanied
with decreased invasiveness, lupeol induced morphologic changes
from fibroblastic to epithelial appearance, which was accompanied
with a gain of the epithelial marker vimentin and loss of
mesenchymal markers. In addition, these changes were accompanied with increased translocation of E-cadherin from the membrane
to the cytoplasm, indicating functional activation. To further
examine whether reversal of EMT is NF-nB dependent, we
transfected IKKhWT into CAL27 cells. Activation of NF-nB by
IKKhWT offset the effect of lupeol on reversal of EMT. Our work is
the first demonstration that lupeol suppresses tumor cell invasiveness by reversal of EMT via the down-regulation of NF-nB activity.

To gain further support for our hypothesis, the in vivo effects of
lupeol were examined in an orthotopic metastatic nude mouse
model of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. In this animal
model, tongue carcinoma cells invade the lower jaw and
metastasize to the neck lymph node after 37 days of tumor
inoculation. On day 37, the body weight of nude mice is decreased
due to a feeding problem. Lupeol was i.p. administered on day 7
after tumor inoculation rather on the day 0 time point. Lupeol
shrunk the tumor volume by induction of apoptosis and necrosis as
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Lupeol showed no sign of toxicity.
Interestingly, no local metastasis was detected in lupeol-treated
nude mice, likely due to reversal of NF-nB–dependent EMT.
Cisplatin alone (5 mg/kg) was able to partly suppress tumor
growth; however, only three of five nude mice showed no jaw
invasion or nodal metastasis. In addition, cisplatin has severe side
effects in terms of decreasing body weight. Our data showed that
lupeol is surprisingly more potent than cisplatin by f3-fold in
terms of decrease in tumor volume. Lupeol combined with low-dose
cisplatin (5-fold less than cisplatin alone) can effectively suppress
tumor growth and metastasis. Most importantly, combination
therapy with a low dose of cisplatin is f40-fold more potent than
cisplatin alone and has no side effects in this animal model.
Taken together, our present study showed, both in vitro and
in vivo, the anticancer and antimetastatic efficacy of lupeol, which
acts by down-regulating NF-nB activity, against HNSCC with high
NF-nB expression without any toxicity in nonneoplastic tongue
fibroblast cells. Our experiments using our animal model showed
that lupeol is much more potent than cisplatin in the treatment of
HNSCC in terms of efficacy, specificity, and toxicity. Lupeol exerted
a significant synergistic cytotoxic effect when combined with lowdose cisplatin without side effects. Our tongue model system
provides a strong basis for the development of lupeol as a single
agent or for use in combination for the treatment of different types
of cancers in which NF-nB plays a significant role.

Correction: Lupeol Suppresses CisplatinInduced Nuclear Factor-kB Activation in Head
and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and
Inhibits Local Invasion and Nodal Metastasis
in an Orthotopic Nude Mouse Model
In this article (Cancer Res 2007;67:8800–9), which appeared in the September 15,
2007 issue of Cancer Research (1), there are errors in Figs. 2C and 5B; incorrect gel
images belonging to a different experiment were inadvertently used. The affected
data are total p65 and total p50 in Fig. 2C and a-SMA in Fig. 5B for CAL27 cells.
The data shown for MDA1986 cells are accurate. The authors were unable to
retrieve the original data, so they repeated results as shown in these three gel
photos as well as other unaffected gel photos within the panels of Figs. 2C and 5B
in CAL27cells but not MDA1986 cells. From the new data, the authors observed
similar ﬁndings as described in the article that lupeol has no effect on total p65
and p50 and exerted signiﬁcant suppressive effect on a-SMA in a time-dependent
manner. For the result in nuclear p65, a discrepancy was found in the time point
for the decrease in nuclear NF-kB expression upon lupeol administration for the
new data; the authors believe that this discrepancy may be due to different
passages of CAL27 and a different batch of lupeol used in the new experiment.
Overall, the authors found the suppressive effect of lupeol on NF-kB activation.
The corrected ﬁgures appear below.

Figure 2.

The authors believe that the effect of lupeol on NF-kB and EMT represents the true
phenomenon and are conﬁdent that these inadvertent mistakes in ﬁgure assembly do
not affect the conclusions drawn or the validity of the underlying research and
apologize to the community for any confusion they have caused.
