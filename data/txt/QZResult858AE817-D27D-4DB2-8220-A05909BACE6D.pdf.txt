ABSTRACT
Ribonucleases represent a new class of antitumor RNA-damaging drugs.
However, many wild-type members of the vertebrate secreted ribonuclease family are
not cytotoxic because they are not able to evade the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor.
We previously engineered the human pancreatic ribonuclease to direct it to the cell
nucleus where the inhibitor is not present. The best characterized variant is PE5 that
kills cancer cells through apoptosis mediated by the p21WAF1/CIP1 induction and the
inactivation of JNK. Here, we have used microarray-derived transcriptional profiling
to identify PE5 regulated genes on the NCI/ADR-RES ovarian cancer cell line. RT-qPCR
analyses have confirmed the expression microarray findings. The results show that
PE5 cause pleiotropic effects. Among them, it is remarkable the down-regulation of
multiple genes that code for enzymes involved in deregulated metabolic pathways
in cancer cells.

(RI) that is found in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells.
RI is a 50 kDa protein that tightly binds to some RNases
inhibiting their activity [5]. Thus, the cytotoxic potential
of a particular RNase also depends on its ability to by-pass
the RI action [6].
The members of the vertebrate secreted RNase
family that naturally present cytotoxic activity selective
for tumor cells evade the RI. Among them, Onconase®
(ONC), an amphibian RNase isolated from oocytes of
Rana pipiens, is the paradigm [3]. However, its clinical
use has been limited because it induces renal toxicity at
high concentrations [7]. In contrast, mammalian pancreatic
RNases accumulate to a much lesser extent in kidneys [8],
are less immunogenic, display a higher ribonucleolytic
activity [9] but are very sensitive to the RI. To endow
them with cytotoxic properties, they have been engineered
to either evade the RI [10–12] or to be more efficiently
delivered into the cells to ensure a competent arrival to the
cytosol to saturate the RI [13,14].
We developed another strategy consisting in routing
the RNase into the nucleus. Nuclear compartment, or at
least its nucleolus, has been described to be free of RI
[15,16]. We designed and produced nuclear-directed

INTRODUCTION
Among the special biological actions exhibited by
several members of the vertebrate secreted ribonuclease
(RNase) family, selective cytotoxicity for cancer cells
is one of the most interesting (for reviews see [1–3]).
In contrast to many chemotherapeutic drugs currently
used in cancer therapy, which target DNA synthesis and
transcription, cytotoxic RNases target RNA functions,
such as protein synthesis or gene regulation (for a review
see [4]) and, therefore, they are non-mutagenic antitumor
drugs.
Although the exact mechanism used by RNases to
kill cancer cells is not completely understood, from the
knowledge gained so far, a multi-step model has been
generally accepted. The model postulates that RNases
initially interact with the cell membrane and then
internalization proceeds via endocytosis. At some point in
the endocytic pathway, cytotoxic RNases are translocated
to the cytoplasm where they cleave cellular RNA(s),
inhibiting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis. The
cytotoxic action of some RNases may be hampered by
the action of a potent inhibitor, the ribonuclease inhibitor

human pancreatic RNase (ND-RNase) variants that are
cytotoxic for cancer cells [17,18]. Among them, the best
characterized is PE5, endowed with a non-contiguous
extended bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS)
[19]. This NLS binds specifically to α-importin [20],
which drives the RNase into the nucleolus in a GTP- and
Ran-dependent manner [17]. Once there, the ND-RNase
cleaves nuclear RNA leaving cytoplasmic RNA unaffected
[20]. It has been shown that the introduction of this NLS
is necessary for the nuclear transport of PE5 and crucial
for its cytotoxicity [17,19,20]. In vitro, PE5 selectively
kills tumor cells. Its cytotoxicity is produced through
apoptosis activating caspases-8 and -9 and the executioner
caspase-3 [21]. It is noteworthy that PE5 induced
apoptosis is associated with the p21WAF1/CIP1 induction and
the inactivation of JNK. Cell death induced by PE5 also
increases the number of cells in S- and G2/M-phases in
the NCI/ADR-RES cell line [21]. The cytotoxic effect
of PE5 is not prevented by a mutated p53 or a multidrug
resistance (MDR) phenotype [21]. Finally, PE5 is synergic
with doxorubicin on NCI/ADR-RES cells [22].
To get a deeper insight on the molecular cytotoxic
mechanism of PE5, we have used microarray technology to
identify significant altered gene expression upon treatment
of the NCI/ADR-RES ovarian cancer cell line with PE5.
The present work is the first to use microarray-derived
transcriptional profiling to identify ND-RNases-regulated
genes to understand their cytotoxic effect. It is described
that RNases, as RNA-damaging drugs, cause pleiotropic
effects [3]. Remarkably, PE5 down-regulates multiple genes
that code for enzymes involved in deregulated metabolic
pathways in cancer cells. Inhibition of these metabolic
processes in cancer cells leads to a significant inhibition
of cell growth and induction of cell death. This approach
represents a key anticancer strategy that can be used in
combination with other antitumor therapies [23–25].

apoptosis rather than the direct action of the RNase.
Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of PE5 on
NCI/ADR-RES cell line at different RNase concentrations
and incubation times (Figure S1, Supplementary Data). A
dose-dependent cell growth inhibition was apparent after
36 h of incubation with PE5 that increased with time.
Then we analyzed the RNA degradation caused by
the different treatments. We incubated NCI/ADR-RES
cells with PE5 concentrations that induced a decrease of
cell proliferation of 5%, 10%, and 15% (IC5, IC10, and
IC15) after 36 h of incubation. We did not analyze higher
RNase concentrations because we had previously observed
an extensive cleavage of nuclear RNA in HeLa cells
incubated with PE5 at a concentration equivalent to IC20
[20]. The RNA degradation of treated and untreated cells
was quantified using a bioanalyzer. The RNA integrity
obtained after PE5 treatment at the three concentrations,
IC5, IC10, and IC15 gave RIN values of 8.8, 7.9 and 6.60,
respectively. Accordingly, we carried out the microarray
experiments at a PE5 concentration of 12 μM that
triggered a decrease of 10% of cell viability, after 36 h of
treatment, without an extensive RNA degradation.

Gene expression changes in PE5-treated cells
PE5-treated and untreated NCI/ADR-RES cells
revealed 647 differentially expressed genes out of 35,377
present in the microarray (1.83%). Among them, 47%
were down-regulated (decrease from untreated cells
ranged from 2- to 4-fold) while 53% were up-regulated
in PE5-treated cells (increase from untreated cells ranged
from 2- to 106-fold). This suggests that the primary
effect of PE5 is both to increase and to decrease gene
expression. Among the PE5 down-regulated genes many
are known to be involved in cell adhesion and migration
(e.g. GPC6, and EFEMP1), amino acid metabolism (e.g.
PYCR1, BCAT1, PHGDH and ASNS), lipid metabolism
(e.g. HADHA, DHCR24, ACACA and SPTLC3), and
glucose metabolism (e.g. PGM1, PGAM1, LDHA and
ENO1). In particular, some of them are known to be upregulated in tumor cells enhancing the aggressive nature of
tumors (e.g. EFEMP1), promoting migration and invasion
of cancer cells (e.g. GPC6) or acting as proto-oncogenes
(e.g. MET). Among the PE5 up-regulated genes many
are known to be involved in transcription regulation (e.g.
HMBOX1, SPEN, RPA4 and MXD1), apoptosis (e.g.
BCL2L11, WWOX and BNIP3L), and signaling pathways
or transduction (e.g. LRRC2, PPP6R1, RAP1GAP and
CISH). Interestingly, some of them function as tumor
suppressors (e.g. BCL2L11, MXD1, WWOX, BNIP3L,
and DMTF1) or are candidate tumor suppressors having
anti-proliferative properties and DNA repair abilities (e.g.
LRRC2, RPA4, PPP6R1, SPEN, RAP1GAP and CISH)
(see discussion section). Some of the above genes are
among the top 20 PE5 up- and down-regulated genes in
NCI/ADR-RES cell line (Table S1, Supplementary Data).

RESULTS
Since the initial characterization of the cytotoxic
mechanism of PE5 was performed in the ovarian cancer
cell line, NCI/ADR-RES, we decided to extend the study
using microarray technology on the same cell line.

Cell proliferation and RNase sensitivity
PE5 has ribonucleolytic activity and to get an
unbiased approach to examine gene expression by
microarray technology, it is very important to search for
optimal cell treatment conditions. The RNA population
has to be representative of the actual drug effect and not
the result of an extensive RNA degradation that would
preclude the chance of microarray analysis. In addition,
because the induction of apoptosis increases the RNA
turnover [26], an extensive cytotoxic effect would generate
changes in the RNA levels as a consequence of cellular

RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression

DISCUSSION

mRNA expression of six PE5 down-regulated
genes (G6PD, ACACA, PHGDH, IDH2, AKR1A1,
and MET) and one up-regulated gene (BCL2L11),
representatives of the processes affected by this RNase,
were examined by RT-qPCR. The results are presented in
Figure S2 of Supplementary Data. Fold changes obtained
with RT-qPCR, calculated as the ratio between relative
transcript abundance (RTA) values obtained for PE5
treated cells and RTA values obtained for untreated cells,
were similar to those found in the microarray analysis
(Table 1) confirming that the microarray experiments are
fully valid.

Gene ontology analysis clustered the 647 PE5
affected genes to different terms (Table 2). Among
them, we have considered that lipid and carbohydrate
metabolism, response to stress and cell adhesion and
proliferation are the most relevant to understand how
PE5 arrests NC/ADR-RES cell proliferation and induces
apoptosis. Moreover, KEGG analysis shows that 11 out of
19 terms are related to metabolic processes (Table 3). Most
of the genes involved in these terms are down-regulated.
Although they constitute a 47% of the total affected genes,
this percentage significantly increases when considering
the genes belonging to the above mentioned terms (Tables
2 and 3). It is tempting to speculate that the expression
of up-regulated genes could be due to the cleavage of
different microRNAs, as it has been demonstrated for
ONC [28]. Further, whereas PE5 down-regulated genes
can be clustered in gene ontology and KEGG terms
to explain PE5 cytotoxic action, the PE5 up-regulated
genes, with the exception of tumor suppressors, cannot.
Interestingly, among the 20 more up-regulated genes
(Table S1 Supplementary Data), six are candidate tumor
suppressors (see below). Thus, although we cannot rule
out a role of PE5 up-regulated genes in the cytotoxic
mechanism of this drug most of the genes discussed below
are down-regulated.

Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway
annotation
Although the information obtained from
individual gene expression changes as a response to
PE5 treatment gives clues to the action of this RNase,
to better understand the functional relevance of its
regulated genes in NCI/ADR-RES cells, we performed
a gene ontology analysis. PE5 differentially expressed
genes were used to find over-represented gene
ontology terms in the three broad ontology categories:
“molecular function”, that captures the knowledge
about the functional activity of gene products, the larger
“biological process” as part of which these specific
functions collectively act, and “cellular component”
where all this occurs. To the same end, PE5 differentially
expressed genes were mapped to KEGG database to
find overrepresented known metabolic and regulatory
pathways. In all cases, a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Gene ontology analyses showed that PE5
differentially expressed genes are related to different
cellular events (Table 2). Among them, we can highlight
the biological process ontologies related to lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, cell adhesion,
proliferation and migration. Interestingly, response to
stress term includes genes involved in reactive oxygen
species (ROS) quenching and antitumor therapy resistance.
Likewise, cell proliferation contains genes that act as
tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The individual function
of PE5 differentially expressed genes favored nucleotide
binding, peptidase activity, and pyrophosphatase activity
and they were mainly associated with lysosomes, plasma
membrane and anchoring junction.
Analysis of the over-represented pathways collected
in the KEGG database showed that 19 pathways were
affected by PE5 treatment (Table 3). Most of them were
involved in cell metabolism and, of particular interest,
are those of pyruvate and glucose metabolism for their
relevance in cancer cells [27].

PE5 down-regulates genes coding for enzymes
involved in deregulated metabolic pathways in
cancer cells
PE5 down-regulates genes related to glucose
metabolism such as phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1),
enolase 1, (alpha) (ENO1), glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
(PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1)
and phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1). PGAM1 and ENO1
repression produce a decrease in the glycolytic flux
associated with a reduction of tumor growth [29–32].
Both genes are over-expressed in different types of cancer
[31–34]. G6PD derives the G6P from glycolysis to the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Figure 1), a critical
way to obtain both ribose-5-phosphate for biosynthesis
and reducing equivalents in form of NADPH, which are
used not only for biosynthesis but for scavenging cellular
ROS [35]. PHGDH and PSAT1 are critical to derive a
significant portion of glycolytic carbon to the biosynthesis
of serine and glycine amino acids (Figure 1). PHGDH
has been identified as a gene frequently amplified in
different cancers [36,37]. PGM1 is an enzyme that can
increase the levels of G6P through glycogenolysis. It has
been described that glycogen-derived glucose contributes
to ATP generation without oxygen requirement, ROS
scavenging, and biosynthesis of macromolecules [38].

PE5 down-regulates the gene coding for lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The acidification of tumor
surroundings produced by excreted lactate helps tumor
invasion and inhibits the immune system. Moreover,
lactate is a gluconeogenic precursor and although
the role of gluconeogenesis in cancer is still not well
known, the key mitochondrial gluconeogenic enzyme,
phophoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 mitochondrial
(PCK2), also down-regulated by PE5, is expressed in
different non-gluconeogenic tissues including tumors
[39–41]. Recently [42] it has been demonstrated that in
lung cancer cell lines incubated with 13C-lactate, the three
lactate carbon atoms appear in the phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) pool, supporting a conversion of lactate to PEP
via gluconeogenesis (Figure 1). This suggests that some
steps of gluconeogenesis are used to overcome the
detrimental metabolic situation generated by aglycemia
periods generated by the sustained high rate of cell
proliferation [43].
PE5 down-regulates some enzymes involved in
the oxidation of fatty acids, a key pathway for energy
generation in cancer cells [44]. We can mention propionyl
CoA carboxylase beta polypeptide (PCCB), as well
as hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA
thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein), alpha
subunit (HADHA) (Figure 1).
On the other hand, cancer cells are highly dependent
on de novo lipid biosynthesis [44]. PE5 down-regulates
acetyl-CoA carboxylase, alpha (ACACA) (Figure 1).
Citrate is a critical metabolite required to support cytosolic
lipid biosynthesis. In cancer cells, TCA cycle anaplerosis
is maintained mainly by glutamine [45,46]. Glutaminederived α-ketoglutarate is reductively carboxylated by
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1, IDH2) to isocitrate/
citrate (Figure 1) [47,48]. NADPH-linked mitochondrial
isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is a PE5-downregulated enzyme. Interestingly, it has recently described
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that IDH2 is involved in the generation of oncometabolite
2-hydroxiglutarate (2-HG) [49]. Cells have other ways to
refurbish TCA cycle [45]. Mitochondrial extruded citrate
converted to OAA and acetil-CoA by ATP citrate lyase
(ACL) can re-enter the OAA moiety through several steps
(Figure 1) that include the PE5 down-regulated NADP+dependentmitochondrial malic enzyme 3 (ME3).
The increased fatty acid synthesis leads to the upregulation of the phospholipids [50], sphingolipids [51]
and cholesterol biosynthesis [44]. Some genes involved
in sphingolipid synthesis have a decreased expression
upon PE5 cell treatment: serine palmitoyltransferase long
chain base subunit 3 (SPTLC3) and N-acylsphingosine
amidohydrolase (acid ceramidase) 1 (ASAH1). PE5 also
down-regulates some key enzymes involved in cholesterol
synthesis such as 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase
(DHCR24), transmembrane 7 superfamily member 2
(TM7SF2), monooxygenase 1 (MSMO1) (Figure 1). It
is worth mentioning that deregulation of the mevalonate
pathway has been associated with transformation [52–54].
Although we have not found a term in gene
ontology and KEGG analysis related to amino acid
metabolism it is worth mentioning that PE5 treatment
reduces the expression level of genes involved in amino
acid biosynthesis other than PHGDH and G6PD described
above. These genes are pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase
1 (PYCR1), asparagine synthetase (ASNS), and the
catabolizing amino acid enzyme, branched-chain amino
acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1). All three enzymes are
found over-expressed in different cancers and ASNS
is associated with resistance to L-asparaginase cancer
therapy [55–57]. Interestingly, PHGDH, PYCR1 and
BCAT1 are among the 20 most PE5 down-regulated genes
(Table S1 Supplementary Data).
KEGG analysis shows that PE5 may also inhibit
the protein synthesis since it down-regulates many genes
coding for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. These genes

Rac/Rho, MAPK, and phospholipase C-γ [64], frequently
activated in human cancers [68]. TGM2 activates the
pro-survival NF-κB [69] and focal adhesion kinase/Akt,
whereas it negatively regulates the tumor suppressor
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) [70]. PTEN
suppression in malignant cells increases the PI3K system
activity [27]. CLU activates the pro-survival Akt [71]
while inhibiting the pro-apoptotic Bax [72]. Akt can
activate ACL by phosphorylation [73] and activate the
expression of several genes involved in fatty acid and
cholesterol biosynthesis, such as FASN, ACC, ACL,
ACAT, HMGCS and HMGCR, through their effects
on the transcription factor family of sterol regulatory
element-binding proteins (SREBPs) [74]. One important
downstream effector of Akt is the mammalian target
of rapamycin complex I (mTORC1), involved in the
regulation of several metabolic processes, including
protein synthesis [75], whose activity is required for the
nuclear accumulation of mature SREBPs. Activation of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway also increases glycolysis and
lactate production and is sufficient to induce the Warburg
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effect [27]. It is also worth mentioning that GPC6, the
most PE5 down-regulated gene, belongs to the glypican
family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans [76].
Expression of GPC6 promotes invasive migration through
up-regulation of Wnt5A signaling. More interesting,
GPC6 induction of Wnt5A stimulates the activation of
JNK and p38 MAPK [77]. We have demonstrated that
PE5 kills cancer cells through apoptosis associated with
the p21WAF1/CIP1 induction and JNK inactivation [21], thus
a PE5 down-regulation of GPC6 might contribute to JNK
inactivation.
Tumor suppressor genes up-regulated by PE5
treatment are the apoptosis facilitator BCL2-like 11
(BCL2L11), MAX dimerization protein 1 (MXD1),
ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB), BCL2/
adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L),
cyclin D binding myb-like transcription factor 1 (DMTF1),
WW domain containing oxidoreductase (WWOX), and
nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in
B-cells inhibitor, alpha (NFKBIA). All of them play two
main roles, apoptosis activation or facilitation [78–81] and

oncogene antagonism [82–86]. In addition, among the 20
most PE5 up-regulated genes (Table S1, Supplementary
Data) some are candidate tumor suppressors: Leucine
rich repeat containing 2 (LRRC2) [87,88], Replication
protein A4, 30kDa (RPA4) [89,90], Protein phosphatase
6, regulatory subunit (PPP6R1) [91,92], Spen homolog,
transcriptional regulator (Drosophila) (SPEN) [93],
RAP1GTPase activating protein (RAP1GAP) [94] and
cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) [95].
Like oncogenes, some of these tumor suppressor
genes are related to metabolic reprogramming of cancer
cells (Figure 2). BCL2L11 interacts with all anti-apoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 protein family and acts as an
apoptotic activator [78]. Loss of even one BCL2L11 allele
accelerates Myc-induced development of tumors [96].
MXD1 is considered an antagonist of the oncogene Myc
[82]. WWOX interacts with different oncogenic proteins
sequestering them in the cytoplasm and thereby inhibiting
their oncogenic activity [97–99]. Several oncogenes,
like Myc and receptor tyrosine kinases can stimulate the
transcription of a number of genes encoding the proteins

that mediate glycolysis and glutaminolysis pathways
[100]. Moreover, WWOX controls the expression of
glycolytic genes through hypoxia-inducible transcription
factor-1α regulation (HIF-1α) [101–103]. Therefore,
PE5-induced over-expression of BCL2L11, MXD1 and
WWOX reinforces the suppression of the metabolic
reprograming of cancer cells induced by PE5 downregulated oncogenes described above. NFKBIA inhibits
the transcription factor NF-kB [86]. Thus, PE5 can reduce
the NF-kB activity both by down-regulating its activator
oncogene (TGM2) and by up-regulating its inhibitor
(NFKBIA). The NF-kB pathway has been recently
described as involved in metabolic reprogramming [104].

PE5 down-regulates genes related to ROS
quenching and antitumor therapy resistance
In addition to the effects mentioned above, PE5
decreases the expression of genes involved in the
quenching of ROS. Treatment with PE5 reduces the
expression of two genes involved in the detoxification of

Figure 2: Potential links between PE5 down-regulated oncogenes and up-regulated tumor suppressors and deregulated
metabolic pathways through signaling pathways. The PE5 down-regulated oncogenes and the PE5 up-regulated tumor suppressors

are shown in the blue boxes while the potential signaling pathways are indicated in the empty boxes. The deregulated metabolic pathways
are inhibited by both the down-regulation of the oncogenes and the up-regulation of the tumor suppressor (see text for more details).

ROS, thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) and glutathione
peroxidase 3 (GPX3), belonging to thioredoxin [105]
and glutathione antioxidant systems [106], respectively.
Of note, glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant systems
rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their
activities. As stated above, PE5 decreases the expression
level of relevant proteins involved in the production
of NADPH (G6PD, ME3 and IDH2). Altogether, this
reduction can induce apoptosis due to high ROS levels in
cancer cells treated with PE5.
On the other hand, reduced glutathione has an
important role in a number of drug resistance mechanisms
[107]. In addition, some of the above mentioned PE5
down-regulated genes are involved in resistance to
antitumor therapy. For instance, MET whose activation
is related to resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
inhibitors [108], PDGFRB whose inhibition is associated
with an improved tumor drug uptake [109], CLU that
interferes with apoptotic signaling and confers resistance
to a broad spectrum of anti-cancer treatments [110,111],
and ASNS involved in resistance to L-asparaginase
[56,112]. Likewise, up-regulation of some of the above
stated tumor suppressors such as BCL2L11, RHOB
and NFKBIA, contributes to fight against the antitumor
drug resistance because they mediate apoptosis induced
by several anticancer drugs [113–115]. PE5 also downregulates the expression of two enzymes directly involved
in the MDR phenotype: i) aldo-keto reductase family 1
member A1 (AKR1A1) that metabolizes anthracyclines
into inactive compounds [116] and has been associated
with acquired resistance to irradiation [117]; ii) prosaposin
(PSAP), present among the 20 most PE5 downregulated genes (Table S1 Supplementary Data), found
overexpressed in ovarian tumors after chemotherapy [118]
and involved in estrogen chemotherapy resistance [119].

NCI/ADR-RES human ovarian cancer MDR cell
line (formerly MCF-7/AdrR) [123] was a generous gift
of Dr. Ramon Colomer of the Institut Català d’Oncologia
de Girona, Hospital Universitari de Girona Dr. Josep
Trueta (Girona, Spain). They were initially obtained from
American type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,
Virginia) and were used immediately after resuscitation.
Cells were routinely grown at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM (Gibco, Germany)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Germany), 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco, Germany), and 1.84 μM doxorubicin (TedecMeijic Farma, Spain). Cells remained free of Mycoplasma
and were propagated according to established protocols.

Cell proliferation assay
NCI/ADR-RES cells (104 per well) were seeded
into 96-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells were
treated for 24, 36, or 48 h with various concentrations of
PE5, ranging from 0.1 to 30 μM. RNase sensitivity was
determined by the MTT method essentially as described by
the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma, USA). Data were
collected by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a
Synergy 4 multi-well plate reader (Biotek Instruments,
USA). The IC5, IC10, and IC15 values represent the
concentrations of PE5 required to inhibit cell proliferation
by 5, 10, and 15%, respectively, and were calculated by
interpolation from the obtained growth curves. Data are
expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments
conducted in triplicates.

PE5 treatment and RNA isolation
NCI/ADR-RES cells (2x105 per well) were seeded
into 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells were
treated for 36 h with a concentration of PE5 that caused
a 10% decrease of cell proliferation (12 μM). Cells were
then harvested at 400 xg for 5 min at 4°C and washed
twice with cold PBS. Total RNA was extracted using
the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems/
Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and stored at -80°C. Four independent
preparations were performed. RNA integrity and
absorbance 260/280 nm ratio of each sample were checked
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
USA) and a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PE5 expression and purification
Construction of PE5 has been previously
described [17]. It was obtained from PM5 (a human
pancreatic RNase variant carrying five substitutions at
the N-terminus: Arg4Ala, Lys6Ala, Gln9Glu, Asp16Gly,
and Ser17Asn [120]) by replacing Gly89 and Ser90 by
Arg. PE5 was produced and purified from Escherichia
coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the corresponding
vector essentially as described previously [121]. The
molecular mass of PE5 was confirmed by Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry at Unitat cientificotècnica de suport,
Institut de Recerca, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron
(Barcelona, Spain). PE5 concentration was determined by
ultraviolet spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient
at 280 nm of 7950 M-1 cm-1, calculated as reported
previously [122].

oligonucleotide microarray that contains 60,000 probes
that correspond to 27,958 Entrez Gene RNAs and
7,419 lncRNAs. Sample preparation and microarray
processing procedures were done according to the TwoColor Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis v.
6.5 (Agilent Technologies, USA). Briefly, 200 ng of total
RNA were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA
with AffinityScript-Reverse Transcriptase and Oligo dTPromoter Primer. cDNA was simultaneously amplified
and transcribed into cyanine 3- or cyanine 5-labeled
cRNA employing T7 RNA Polymerase in presence of
cyanine 3-CTP or cyanine 5-CTP. The labeled cRNA
(antisense) was purified, evaluated using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) and hybridized to the oligonucleotide microarrays
at 65°C for 17 h. Microarrays were then washed and
scanned on a G2565CA Microarray Scanner updated to
2 micron resolution (Agilent Technologies, USA). Data
were extracted from the resulting TIFF-images using the
Feature Extraction software v. 10.7 (Agilent Technologies,
USA). Raw microarray data were statistically analysed
using the software packages Marray, pcaMethods, Limma,
and RankProd from Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.
org), which uses the R statistical environment and
programming language. In particular, the non-specific
signal was removed from the total intensity using the
Normexp background correction method with an offset of
20 [124]. Then intra-slide normalization was done using
the Loess method [125] to make intensities consistent
within each array, and inter-slide normalization was
performed employing the Aquantiles method [126] to
achieve consistency between arrays. After each of these
analyses, a quality control analysis of microarray data
(RG density plot, MA plot and M boxplot) was performed.
Following normalization, the RankProd method [127] was
applied to identify differentially expressed genes. Genes
were considered differentially expressed when they had
a false discovery rate adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold
change ≥ 2 or ≤ −2.
Data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus repository [128] (http://www.
ncbi.nih.gov/geo) and are available under the accession
number: GSE75494.

and RamiGO from Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org).
A p-value cutoff of 0.05 was used.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RTqPCR)
mRNA expression of six PE5 down-regulated genes
(G6PD, ACACA, PHGDH, IDH2, AKR1A1, and MET)
and one up-regulated gene (BCL2L11) were examined
by quantitative real-time PCR. The same RNA samples
used for microarrays analysis were used for performing
this analysis. First, RNA samples were digested with
DNase to prevent genomic contamination using the
RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and were evaluated using
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA)
and a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, for each sample, 0.5 μg
of RNA were used to synthetize single-stranded cDNA
with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gene-specific forward and reverse primers
for the selected genes were designed with Primer3 (http://
primer3.ut.ee) and checked with NetPrimer (http://www.
premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/). Primer sequences are
indicated in Tables S2 and S3 of Supplementary Data
for constitutive and target genes, respectively. Realtime PCRs were performed in an optical 96-well plate
with an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detector System
(Applied Biosystems, USA), using SYBR Green to
monitor dscDNA synthesis. Reactions contained 1x Power
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
USA), 300 nM of gene-specific forward primer, 300
nM of gene-specific reverse primer, and 5μl of a 50fold dilution of the previously synthesized cDNA in a
final volume of 20 μl. The following standard thermal
profile was used for all real-time PCRs: 95°C for 10
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. A
dissociation step was performed after amplification to
confirm the presence of a single amplicon. To estimate
variation in the technique, three technical replicates were
carried out for each cDNA sample. Data were analyzed
with the 7300 SDS 1.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems,
USA). To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the
logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus
cycle number, baseline data were collected between
cycles 3 and 15. All amplification plots were analyzed
with an Rn threshold of 0.2 to obtain threshold cycle
(Ct) values. The amplification efficiency for each gene
was calculated based on five dilutions of cDNA ranging
from 1 to 3,2x10-4 and the equation E = 10(−1/slope). All
genes had an efficiency value between 1.85 and 2.05. To
select a constitutive gene as a reference for normalizing
data, the transcription abundances of five genes (ACTB,
GUSB, TBP, HPRT1, and ALAS1) were measured for all
cDNA samples. Among them, TBP showed the highest

Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway
annotation
Differentially expressed genes were characterized
functionally with an hypergeometric test to find overrepresented gene ontology terms in the three main broad
ontologies (biological process, molecular function, and
cellular component) (www.geneontology.org), and were
also mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) (www.kegg.jp), which assigns proteins
to pathways, to find over-represented pathways. The
analyses were done using the software packages GOstats

stability (lower standard deviation of the Ct) (Figure
S3, Supplementary Data) and therefore was selected as
the reference gene for normalizing data. For the target
genes (G6PD, ACACA, PHGDH, IDH2, AKR1A1, MET,
and BCL2L11), the relative transcription abundances
were calculated as RTA = EΔCt(control-sample)(Target) / EΔCt(controlsample)(Reference)
[129] where control refers to a mix of
equal amounts of untreated samples. Fold changes were
calculated as the ratio between RTA values obtained for
PE5 treated cells and those obtained for untreated cells.
The absence of genomic DNA contamination was checked
using non-retrotranscriptase controls and the absence of
environmental contamination using non-template controls.

During the past decade, cancer metabolism has
emerged as one of the most exciting and promising fields
for the development of selective anticancer therapies.
The development of cancer metabolism inhibitors and
their synergy with traditional therapeutic approaches may
represent a fundamental change and a promising strategy
to overcome resistance in cancer therapy, a phenomenon
that unfortunately is cause of treatment failure and
recidivism in cancer patients. However, new anticancer
drugs have to tackle with the multifactorial phenotype of
tumor cells. PE5 significantly inhibits genes that belong
to metabolic pathways deregulated in cancer cells and it
has the plus of presenting pleiotropic effects. Thus, NDRNases are very interesting antitumor agents because
they can cope with the complex cancer cell phenotype.
In addition, their multiple effects allow anticipating
synergism with many at present antitumor drugs used in
clinical.
