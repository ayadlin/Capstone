ABSTRACT
Human cells respond to DNA damage by elevating sphingosine, a bioactive
sphingolipid that induces programmed cell death (PCD) in response to various forms
of stress, but its regulation and role in the DNA damage response remain obscure.
Herein we demonstrate that DNA damage increases sphingosine levels in tumor cells
by upregulating alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) and that the upregulation of the
ACER2/sphingosine pathway induces PCD in response to DNA damage by increasing
the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with the DNA damaging
agent doxorubicin increased both ACER2 expression and sphingosine levels in HCT116
cells in a dose-dependent manner. ACER2 overexpression increased sphingosine
in HeLa cells whereas knocking down ACER2 inhibited the doxorubicin-induced
increase in sphingosine in HCT116 cells, suggesting that DNA damage elevates
sphingosine by upregulating ACER2. Knocking down ACER2 inhibited an increase
in the apoptotic and necrotic cell population and the cleavage of poly ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP) in HCT116 cells in response to doxorubicin as well as doxorubicininduced release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from these cells. Similar to treatment
with doxorubicin, ACER2 overexpression induced an increase in the apoptotic and
necrotic cell population and PARP cleavage in HeLa cells and LDH release from cells,
suggesting that ACER2 upregulation mediates PCD in response to DNA damage
through sphingosine. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the upregulation of the
ACER2/sphingosine pathway induces PCD by increasing ROS levels. Taken together,
these results suggest that the ACER2/sphingosine pathway mediates PCD in response
to DNA damage through ROS production.

INTRODUCTION

understanding the molecular mechanism of this biological
process is of great importance.
Numerous studies demonstrated that mammalian
cells respond to DNA damage by increasing the levels
of bioactive sphingolipids, including ceramides [4–14],
sphingosine (SPH) [15], and sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) [16], which have been implicated in various cellular
responses. Both ceramides [4–12] and SPH [15] have been
shown to induce cell growth arrest and/or PCD in response
to various forms of stress, including DNA damage. In
contrast to ceramides and SPH, S1P has been shown to
mainly promote cell proliferation and survival [17–19]

Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage by
undergoing cell cycle arrest in order to repair damaged
DNA or by initiating programmed cell death (PCD) if
the damaged DNA is irreparable [1]. These coordinated
biological processes, known as the DNA damage response
(DDR), ensure not to pass on the damaged genome from
mother cells to daughter cells, thereby playing a protective
role in the genomic integrity [2]. Because dysregulation
of the DDR results in genomic instability and contributes
greatly to both cancer development and progression [3],

although it may also exert the opposing effects on certain
cell types [20, 21]. The role and regulation of ceramides
and S1P in the DDR have been intensively studied,
whereas much remains unclear about the regulation and
role of SPH in the DDR.
In mammalian cells, ceramides are generated
via multiple pathways catalyzed by various enzymes,
including sphingomyelinases (SMPDs) [22] and (dihydro)
ceramide synthases (CERSs) [23] (Supplementary
Figure S1). SPH is essentially generated from the
hydrolysis of ceramides by the action of ceramidases
[24] (Supplementary Figure  S1). To date, five human
ceramidase genes have been identified, including ASAH1,
ASAH2, ACER1, ACER2, and ACER3, and their protein
products are classified as the acid (ASAH1), neutral
(ASAH2), and alkaline ceramidase (ACER1–3) subtypes
according to their pH optima for their catalytic activity
[24]. SPH is in turn phosphorylated by SPHK1 and
SPHK2 to form S1P [25] (Supplementary Figure S1).
Increasing studies have demonstrated that ceramidases
may play an important role in regulating the DDR by
controlling the levels of bioactive sphingolipids. Morales
et al. [26] demonstrated that treatment with daunorubicin,
a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent, transiently
increases acid ceramidase activity in liver cancer cells
and that this activity increase attenuates daurorubicininduced programmed cell death probably by inversely
regulating cellular levels of ceramide and S1P. Cheng
et al. [27] demonstrated that the acid ceramidase ASAH1
is upregulated by ionizing radiation (IR), a potent DNA
damaging insult, in tumor cells and that its upregulation
protects tumor cells from IR-induced apoptosis by
reducing ceramides and/or increasing S1P. Wu et al. [28]
showed that the mouse neutral ceramidase Asah2 was
downregulated in transformed murine endothelial cells by
Gemcitabine, a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent,
and that its downregulation mediates cell cycle arrest
probably by increasing the cellular levels of ceramides.
Uchida et al. [29] found that ultraviolet radiation
downregulates both ASAH1 and ASAH2 in human
epidermal keratinocytes and that the downregulation
of these ceramidases mediates apoptosis probably by
elevating ceramides and/or reducing S1P. These results
suggest that ASAH1 and ASAH2 play an important role
in the DDR by regulating ceramides and/or S1P other than
SPH. Intriguingly, although SPH has been long known to
mediate PCD in cells in response to DNA damage [15], the
ceramidase (s) responsible for SPH generation in response
to DNA damage has (have) not been identified.
In this study, with a qPCR array that simultaneously
quantifies mRNA levels of major enzymes involved in
the metabolism of sphingolipids, we identify ACER2, a
Golgi alkaline ceramidase [30], as the major sphingolipidmetabolizing enzyme whose expression is markedly
upregulated by DNA damage. We provide ample evidence
that ACER2 is the ceramidase responsible for the SPH
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rise in response to DNA damage. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the upregulation of the ACER2/SPH
pathway mediates PCD in response to DNA damage by
inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
thus, offering novel insights into the molecular mechanism
of the DDR.

RESULTS
The DNA damaging agent doxorubicin (DXR)
increases the levels of SPH and S1P in human
tumor cells
With LC-MS/MS, we demonstrated that treatment
with the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin (DXR)
increased the levels of SPH (Figure 1A) and S1P
(Figure 1B) in HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Unexpectedly, treatment with DXR only slightly increased
the levels of ceramides in HCT116 cells (Figure 1C).
These results suggest that cells respond to the DNA
damaging agent DXR by increasing the levels of both SPH
and S1P and to a lesser extent, ceramides in HCT116 cells.

DNA damage upregulates ACER2
To better understand the molecular mechanism by
which DNA damage regulates bioactive sphingolipids,
we investigated how DNA damage globally alters the
expression of major sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes
(Supplementary Figure S1) by conducting a sphingolipid
pathway-specific qPCR array that simultaneously
quantifies major sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes
[31]. We demonstrated that treatment with DXR caused
a marked increase in the mRNA levels of ACER2, in
addition to a moderate increase in the mRNA levels of
ceramide-generating enzymes including ceramide synthase
3 (CERS3), acid sphingomyelinase (SMPD1), and neutral
sphingomyelinase 2 (SMPD3) without affecting SPHK1 or
SPHK2 mRNA levels in HCT116 cells (Figure 2A). qPCR
analyses confirmed that DXR increased ACER2 mRNA
levels in HCT116 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B).
Moreover, DXR also increased ACER2 protein level
(Figure 2C) and its enzymatic activity (Figure 2D). We
also confirmed that DXR failed to alter ceramidase activity
encoded by ASAH1, ASAH2, ACER1, or ACER3 in these
cells (Figure 2D).
To determine if ACER2 upregulation by DXR is
a cell type-dependent or independent event, we tested
if DXR increased ACER2 mRNA levels in other cell
lines. Interestingly, treatment with DXR increased
ACER2 mRNA levels in HeLa, MCF-7, A459, or HepG2
cells but not in MDA-MB-231, H1299, or Hep3B
(Figure  2E). These results suggest that DXR-induced
upregulation of ACER2 is a cell type-specific event.
To determine if DXR upregulated ACER2 through
DNA damage, we determined if treatment with a different

ACER2 regulates the levels of bioactive
sphingolipids in response to DNA damage

DNA damaging agent upregulated ACER2 in selected
cancer cell lines. Indeed, we found that 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), which induces DNA damage through a mechanism
different from DXR, also upregulated ACER2 mRNA
levels in HCT116, MCF-7, A459, or HepG2 cells but
not in HT-29, MDA-MB-231, H1299, or Hep3B cells
(Figure  2F), confirming that DNA damage upregulates
ACER2 independently of genotoxic stress type.

We previously demonstrated that ACER2
overexpression increases both SPH and S1P levels in
T-REX-HeLa cells [30]. This prompted us to test the
hypothesis that ACER2 upregulation mediates the
increases in the levels of both SPH and S1P in cells in

down ACER2 inhibited the DXR-induced increases
in the levels of both SPH and S1P in HCT116 cells.
We knocked down ACER2 in HCT116 cells through
lentiviral expression of an ACER2-specific shRNA,
shACER2. DXR increased ACER2 mRNA levels in cells

transduced with lentiviruses expressing a control shRNA
(shCON-HCT116 cells) but not in cells transduced with
lentiviruses expressing shACER2 (shACER2-HCT116
cells) (Figure 3A). Treatment with DXR increased ACER2

with DMSO or DXR at 800 nM for 24 h before total RNA was extracted and subjected to the profiling of mRNA levels of sphingolipidmetabolizing enzymes by a PCR array (A). HCT116 grown to a 75% confluence were treated with DXR at 200, 400, 600, or 800 nM or
DMSO for 24 h before the cells were harvested and subjected to qPCR analyses for quantifying ACER2 mRNA levels (B). HCT116 were
grown to a 75% confluence and treated with DMSO or DXR at 800 nM for 24 h before ACER2 protein levels were determined by Western
blot analyses using anti-ACER2 antibody (C). HCT116 grown to an 80% confluence were treated with DXR at 800 nM or DMSO for 24 h.
The cells were harvested and subjected to ceramidase activity assays with the indicated ceramides or ceramide analogues as substrates at
pH 4.5, pH 7.4, or pH 8.5 as described in Materials and Methods (D). HeLa, MCF-7, HepG2, A549, HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HEP3A, or

inhibited DXR-induced increase in the levels of SPH
(Figure 3C) or S1P (Figure 3D) while enhancing DXRinduced increase in the levels of ceramides (Figure 3E)
in HCT116 cells, suggesting that ACER2 upregulation
mediates a significant portion of the increases in both SPH
and S1P levels in cells in response to DNA damage. These
results also indicate that ceramides generated in response
to DNA damage are converted to SPH in part by the
action of the upregulated ACER2; thereby explaining why

treatment with DXR only slightly increases the levels of
ceramides in HCT116 cells although ceramide-producing
enzymes are upregulated.

ACER2 knockdown inhibits programmed cell
death in response to DNA damage
To test whether ACER2 upregulation was involved
in PCD in response to DNA damage, we determined if

of SPH (C), S1P (D), or ceramides (E) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Data represent mean values ± SD of 3 independent experiments.

ACER2 knockdown affected PCD in HCT116 cells in
response to DXR. shCON-HCT116 cells or shACER2HCT116 cells were treated with different concentrations
of DXR. MTT assays showed that knocking down
ACER2 inhibited the reduction in the viable cell
population in response to treatment with DXR at high
concentrations (≥ 600  nM) but not low concentrations
(≤ 400 nM) (Figure 4A). Treatment with DXR at a low
concentration (400 nM) induced cell cycle arrest at the
G2/M phase to a similar extent in shCON-HCT116 or
shACER2-HCT116 cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure S2A) without increasing the cell population (PI+
and/or AA+) stained positively by propidium iodide (PI)
and/or Alexa Fluor 488-Annexin V (AA), PARP cleavage,
or LDH release from either cell line (Data not shown),
suggesting that a moderate upregulation of ACER2 does
not affect the anti-proliferative effects induced by DXR
at low concentrations. Treatment with DXR at a high
concentration (1,000 nM) induced a marked increase
in the PI+ and/or AA+ cell population (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figure S2B), PARP cleavage (Figure 4D),
and caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 4E) in HCT116 cells
as well as LDH release from these cells (Figure 4F),
and these effects were inhibited by ACER2 knockdown
(Figure  4C, 4D, 4E, and 4F), suggesting that knocking
down ACER2 inhibits PCD in HCT116 cells in response to
DXR at high concentrations. Because the concentration of
DXR correlates with the extent of DNA damage [32], high
concentrations of DXR caused more DNA damage than
low concentrations of DXR. Based on these observations,
we conclude that ACER2 upregulation mediates at least
part of the PCD in response to a high degree of DNA
damage.
To further validate this notion, we determined if
ACER2 upregulation also mediated PCD in response to
a different DNA damaging agent, 5-FU. shCON-HCT116
or shACER2-HCT116 cells were treated with 5-FU or
DMSO for 48 h before PCD was assessed as described
earlier. We found that ACER2 knockdown inhibited a
decrease in the viable cell population measured by MTT
assays (Supplementary Figure S3A), an increase in the
apoptotic and/or necrotic cell population measured by
PI/AA co-staining (Supplementary Figure S3B), and an
increase in LDH release (Supplementary Figure S3C)
in response to treatment with 5-FU. We also confirmed
that ACER2 knockdown inhibited 5-FU-induced increase
in the levels of SPH (Supplementary Figure S3D) or
S1P (Supplementary Figure S3E). These results support
the notion that ACER2 upregulation mediates PCD in
response to DNA damage.

ectopically express ACER2 in a regulated manner, we
used the ACER2 overexpression cell line haCER2-TETON that we previously generated [30] and an isogenic
control cell line, Vec-TET-ON. The haCER2-TET-ON
cell line is a T-REX-HeLa derivative that ectopically
expresses ACER2 under the control of a tetracyclineregulated promoter system, CMV-TET-ON [30], and
Vec-TET-ON is an isogenic cell line which was stably
transfected with an empty TET-ON vector. In the presence
of ethanol (ET), the vehicle of tetracycline (TET), ACER2
expression was moderately increased in haCER2-TET-ON
cells compared to VEC-TET-ON cells due to a leakiness
of the CMV-TET-ON promoter system (Figure 5A).
This moderate upregulation of ACER2 did not affect
cell viability (Figure 5B), the PI+/AA+ cell population
(Figure  5B), PARP cleavage (Figure 5C), or LDH
release (Figure 5E). Upon treatment with TET, ACER2
expression was significantly increased in haCER2-TETON cells but not in VEC-TET-ON cells (Figure 5A).
Treatment with TET caused a reduction in the viable cell
population (Figure 5B), an increase in the PI+/AA+ cell
population (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S2C),
PARP cleavage (Figure 5D), and an increase in caspase
3 activity (Figure 5E) in haCER2-TET-ON cells but not
in VEC-TET-ON cells. Consistently, treatment with TET
also induced LDH release from haCER2-TET-ON cells
but not VEC-TET-ON cells (Figure 5F). These results
demonstrate that high upregulation of ACER2 is sufficient
to induce PCD in cells, and they are consistent with the
role of endogenous ACER2 in mediating PCD in response
to DNA damage.

ACER2 upregulation induces PCD through SPH
Because ACER2 upregulation increases the levels
of both SPH and S1P, with both having been implicated
in PCD [21], we determined which bioactive lipid is the
lipid mediator of ACER2 in PCD by testing if blocking
the conversion of SPH to S1P enhanced or attenuated PCD
in response to ACER2 overexpression. Because SPH is
phosphorylated by SPHK1 and SPHK2, we knocked
down SPHK1 or SPHK2 by RNA interference (RNAi) in
haCER2-TET-ON cells. A small interfering RNA (siRNA)
against SPHK1 (siSPHK1) or SPHK2 (siSPHK2), or a
control siRNAs (siCON) was transfected into haCER2TET-ON before ACER2 overexpression was induced.
qPCR analyses showed that transfection with siSPHK1
and siSPHK2 decreased the mRNA levels of SPHK1
and SPHK2, respectively, compared to transfection with
siCON in haCER2-TET-ON cells (Figure 6A). Knocking
down SPHK1 but not SPHK2 markedly inhibited the
increase in the levels of S1P (Figure 6B) while enhancing
the increase in the levels of SPH (Figure 6C) in haCER2TET-ON cells in response to ACER2 overexpression.
Knocking down SPHK1 but not SPHK2 also enhanced the
reduction in cell viability (Figure 6D) and the increase in

Following the above findings, we determined

the PI+/AA+ cell population (Figure 6E) in haCER2-TETON cells in response to ACER2 overexpression as well
as LDH release from these cells (Figure 6F) in response
to overexpression of ACER2. These results indicate that
inhibiting SPHK1 enhances PCD in response to ACER2

overexpression. To confirm this notion, we investigated
if treatment with PF-543, a highly specific and potent
inhibitor of SPHK1 [33], also enhanced PCD in response
to ACER2 overexpression. haCER2-TET-ON cells were
treated with PF-543 or the vehicle DMSO before ACER2

overexpression was induced. Similar to RNAi-mediated
knockdown of SPHK1, treatment with PF-543 nearly
abolished the increase in S1P levels (Supplementary
Figure S3A) while enhancing the increase in the levels
of SPH in haCER2-TET-ON cells in response to
overexpression of ACER2 (Supplementary Figure S3B),
confirming that the conversion of SPH to S1P is mainly
mediated by SPHK1 in these cells. Treatment with
PF-543 enhanced the viability reduction (Supplementary
Figure S3C), the increase in the number of PI+/AA+ cells
(Supplementary Figure S3D) in haCER2-TET-ON cells
as well as LDH release from these cells (Supplementary
Figure S3E) in response to overexpression of ACER2.

These results confirm that inhibiting the SPHK1-mediated
conversion of SPH to S1P enhances PCD in response to
ACER2 upregulation and suggests that SPH but not S1P
or its metabolites is the lipid mediator of ACER2 in PCD.
Taken together, these results suggest that SPH but not S1P
or its metabolites is the lipid mediator of ACER2 in PCD.

Ceramides indirectly mediate PCD in response
to DNA damage as the substrates of ACER2
Many studies demonstrated that DNA damage
increases the levels of ceramides and that increased
ceramides directly mediate PCD in response to DNA

damage [4–12]. However, our previous study indicated
that their metabolite SPH but not ceramides in the Golgi
complex (referred to as Golgi ceramides) per se directly
mediates PCD in cells [34]. If this hypothesis is correct,
increasing the levels of Golgi ceramides should enhance
PCD in response to ACER2 upregulation. To test this
hypothesis, we determined if treatment with bacterial
sphingomyelinase (bSMase) enhanced PCD in haCER2TET-ON cells in response to ACER2 overexpression. We

previously demonstrated that treatment with bSMase,
which releases ceramides from sphingomyelins on the
plasma membrane, enhanced the generation of both
SPH and S1P in HeLa cells in response to ACER2
overexpression [30], suggesting that ceramides generated
on the plasma membrane are transported to the Golgi
complex where they are hydrolyzed into SPH by ACER2.
Expectedly, treatment with bSMase only slightly induced
a reduction in the viable cell number (Figure 7A) and

an increase in the PI+/AA+ cell population (Figure 7B)
in haCER2-TET-ON cells and LDH release from
these cells (Figure 7C) when ACER2 overexpression
was not induced. However, treatment with bSMase
significantly enhanced the reduction in the viable cell
number (Figure 7A) and the increase in the PI+/AA+ cell
population (Figure 7B) in haCER2-TET-ON cells as well
as LDH release from these cells (Figure 7C) in response
to ACER2 overexpression. LC-MS/MS confirmed that
treatment with bSMase caused a marked increase in the
levels of ceramides (Figure 7D) but a slight increase in the
levels of SPH (Figure 7E) in haCER2-TET-ON cells when
ACER2 overexpresson was not induced. Upon ACER2
overexpression, the bSMase-induced increase in the levels
of SPH was markedly enhanced (Figure 7E) whereas
the bSMase-induced increase in the levels of ceramides
was significantly attenuated in haCER2-TET-ON cells
(Figure  7D). Taken together, these results suggest that
Golgi ceramides that serve as the substrates of ACER2 do
not directly mediate PCD although their increase enhances
the ability of ACER2 to induce PCD by increasing the
production of SPH. These results support the notion that
ACER2 upregulation mediates PCD in response to DNA
damage by converting DNA-damage-induced ceramides
into SPH and suggest that high degree of DNA damage
maximizes the production of SPH and SPH-mediated PCD
by upregulating both ACER2 and its substrates.

suggest that upregualtion of the ACER2/SPH pathway
mediates PCD in response to DNA damage at least in part
by increasing ROS production.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we for the first time reveal that
different degrees of DNA damage upregulate the
expression of ACER2 to different levels and that high
but not low upregulation of ACER2 mediates PCD in
response to DNA damage by accumulating SPH, a prodeath bioactive lipid that induces the production of ROS.
This study highlights the role of ACER2 and its regulated
bioactive lipid SPH in the DDR.
ACER2 is a member in the alkaline ceramidase
family that we previously identified [24, 30]. ACER2 has
seven putative transmembrane domains and is localized
to the Golgi complex [30, 38]. We previously found that
ACER2 was upregulated in human tumor cells in response
to various forms of stress including serum deprivation
[30] and treatment with the retinoid 4-N-hydroxyphenyl
retinamide (4-HPR) [39]. In this current study, we showed
that treatment with the DNA damaging agent DXR or
5-FU upregulated ACER2 in many but not all cancer cell
lines that we examined (Figure 2). Of note, DXR or 5-FU
upregualted ACER2 in the cell lines that express wild-type
p53 but not in the cell lines that express mutant p53 or lack
p53. Sequence analyses found a putative p53 responsive
element in the first intron of the ACER2 gene that perfectly
matches the consensus sequence of p53 binding sites,
indicating that ACER2 may be a transcriptional target
of p53. Indeed, our unpublished results confirmed that
ACER2 is a direct transcriptional target of p53 (manuscript
in preparation). These results suggest that DNA damage
upregulates ACER2 in tumor cells by activating p53. In
addition to ACER2, several other ceramidase genes have
been identified in mammalian cells [24]. Previous studies
by other groups demonstrated that DNA damaging agents
also increase the expression of the acid ceramidase gene
(ASHA1) [27, 40, 41] or transiently increase its activity
in certain cancer cell lines through a post-translational
modification [26] whereas Uchida et al. [29] showed that
DNA damage by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) decreases
ASHA1 and ASHA2 (the neutral ceramidase) activity in
epidermal keratinocytes. However, we found that neither
the expression of ASAH1 and ASAH2 nor their activity
was increased in HCT116 cells, suggesting that DNA
damage regulates ACER2 and other ceramidases through
different mechanisms.
We previously demonstrated that ACER2 catalyzes
the hydrolysis of various ceramide species into SPH in a
Ca2+-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo [38], so
its upregulation would lead to an increase in the levels
of SPH and its phosphate S1P. Indeed, we previously
demonstrated that ACER2 upregulation increases the
levels of both SPH and S1P in T-REX-HeLa cells in

Upregulation of the ACER2/SPH pathway
induces programmed cell death by inducing
ROS production
Previous studies demonstrated that SPH and its
analogs, when added exogenously to cells, induce the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various
cell types [35–37], suggesting that endogenous SPH
generated by the action of ACER2 may induce ROS in
cells. To test this, we determined if ectopic expression
of ACER2 induced ROS production by increasing SPH
in HaCER2-TET-ON cells. haCER2-TET-ON cells were
treated with the SPHK1 inhibitor PF-543 or the vehicle
DMSO before ACER2 overexpression was induced by
TET. ROS assays found that ACER2 overexpression
increased ROS levels in haCER2-TET-ON cells, and
this was further enhanced by treatment with PF-543
(Figure 8A), suggesting that ACER2 upregulation indeed
induces ROS production through SPH. Following this
finding, we then determined if ROS production plays a
role in mediating PCD in response to the upregulation of
the ACER2/SPH pathway. We demonstrated that treatment
with the radical scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole
(BHA) markedly inhibited the reduction in the viable cell
number (Figure 8B) and the increase in the PI+/AA+ cell
population (Figure 8C) in haCER2-TET-ON cells and
LDH release from these cells (Figure 8D) in response
to ACER2 overexpression. Taken together, these results

response to serum deprivation [30]. In this current study,
we demonstrated that ACER2 upregulation mediates the
increases in the levels of both SPH and S1P in HCT116
cells in response to the DNA damaging agent DXR
(Figure 3) or 5-FU (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover,
Cuvillier et al. [15] demonstrated that treatment with DXR
increased the levels of SPH in MCF-7 cells although it
was unclear which ceramidase was responsible for the
SPH rise. Because we showed that DXR also markedly
upregulated ACER2 in MCF-7 cells, it is conceivable that
DXR increases the levels of SPH likely by upregulating
ACER2 in these cells. Taken together, these results suggest
that DNA damage upregulates ACER2 and its product
SPH in various cell lines. Gude et al. [16] demonstrated
that DNA damage by DXR increased the levels of S1P in
Jurkat T cells and U937 cells by increasing the expression
of SPHK1. In HCT116 cells, however, we found that the
DXR-induced S1P rise was caused by the upregulation
of ACER2 but not SPHK1 or SPHK2 (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). These results suggest that ACER2 plays a key
role in regulating the generation of both SPH and S1P in
cells in response to various forms of stress, including DNA
damage, highlighting the role for ACER2 and bioactive
sphingolipids regulated by ACER2 in stress responses.
Previous studies showed that SPH was upregulated
in human cells in response to different stressful insults,
such as glucocorticoid [42], serum deprivation [43], or
oxidative stress [36]and that inhibiting the SPH increase
with the alkaline ceramidase inhibitor (1S,2R)-Derythro2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (D-e-MAPP)
inhibits PCD in response to these stressful insults. These
studies indicated but have not proven that SPH generated
by the action of an alkaline ceramidase directly mediates
PCD in response to stress because SPH can be further
converted to S1P and then hexadecenal, which both have
recently been implicated in PCD as well [21]. In this study,
we showed that blocking the conversion of SPH to S1P
augmented PCD in response to ACER2 overexpression
(Figure 6). This result undoubtedly validates that SPH
generated by the action of ACER2 is a direct mediator
of PCD. We showed that DXR at high concentrations
markedly upregulated both ACERR2 and its product SPH
(Figure 3) and that knocking down ACER2 inhibited not
only the increase in the levels of SPH (Figure 3) but also
PCD (Figure 4) in response to treatment with this DNA
damaging agent. Moreover, our results also demonstrated
that ACER2 upregulation mediates PCD in HCT116 cells
in response to 5-FU (Supplementary Figure S2). Taken
together, these results suggest that a high degree of DNA
damage induces PCD at least in part by upregulating
the ACER2/SPH pathway. We previously demonstrated
that ACER2 can also be upregulated by the retinoid
4-HPR in SCC14 head and neck cancer cells and that
its upregulation mediates the 4-HPR-induced generation
of dihydrosphingosine (DHS), which in turns induces
the death of these cells [39]. These results suggest that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ACER2 regulates PCD through different sphingoid bases
in response to different stressful insults.
Previous studies demonstrated that inhibiting
SPHK1 sensitized cancer cells to PCD in response to
DNA damage [44–46], suggesting that increased S1P
may protect cells from PCD in response to DNA damage.
Because ACER2 upregulation increases the levels of
S1P, in addition to SPH, its upegulation could promote
cell survival in certain contexts. Indeed, we previously
demonstrated that a moderate upregulation of ACER2
increases the levels of S1P in T-REX HeLa cells without
accumulating SPH to a cytotoxic level, thereby promoting
cell survival under the stress of serum deprivation [47]. In
this current study, we showed that a moderate upregulation
of ACER2 in response to a low level of DNA damage
increases the levels of S1P without accumulating SPH
in cells (Figure 1 and Figure 3). The increased S1P may
override the cytotoxicity of a low level of SPH. This may
explain why the low upregulation of ACER2 did not
induce PCD in response to a low degree of DNA damage.
Numerous studies demonstrated that increased
ceramides mediate PCD in response to various forms
of stress, including DNA damage [4–12]. However, our
previous studies indicated that Golgi ceramides indirectly
mediate PCD likely through their metabolite SPH [34].
This view is supported by several lines of evidence present
in this current study. First, knocking down ACER2 did not
induce PCD in HCT116 cells although ceramides were
elevated (Figure 4). Second, we showed that treatment
with bSMase did not induce PCD in cells expressing
a low basal level of ACER2 (Figure 7) although this
treatment caused a marked increase in the cellular levels
of ceramides [48] (Figure 7). Third, treatment with
bSMase markedly enhanced PCD in cells in response
to ACER2 overexpression although bSMase-induced
increase in the levels of ceramides was attenuated by
ACER2 overexpression (Figure 7). The stimulatory effect
of bSMase on PCD in response to ACER2 upregulation is
likely due to an enhancement in the increase in the levels
of SPH because bSMase treatment caused a slight increase
in the levels of SPH in cells expressing a low level of
ACER2, but did so markedly upon ACER2 expression
induction [48] (Figure 7). These results clearly suggest that
Golgi ceramides do not directly induce PCD whereas their
metabolite SPH generated by the action of ACER2 does.
However, as the substrates of ACER2, Golgi ceramides
are necessary for the ACER2-mediated generation of SPH,
and their increase can further enhance the generation of
SPH and PCD in response to ACER2 upregulation. From
these observations, we conclude that a high degree of DNA
damage maximizes the production of SPH by upregulating
both ACER2 and its cellular substrates, ceramides, to
ensure PCD execution in cells with irreparable damaged
genomes.
SPH has been shown to activate various signaling
pathways implicated in PCD, including ROS production

[46]. Similar to SPH, several SPH analogs also induced
ROS production in different cell types [35–37]. However,
in all these studies, exogenous SPH was used, so it
remains unclear if endogenous SPH has such an effect.
In this current study, to our knowledge, we for the first
time demonstrated that increasing endogenous SPH due to

ACER2 upregulation induced ROS production (Figure 8).
More importantly, we proved that the increased production
of ROS mediates PCD induced by ACER2 upregulation
(Figure 8). How ACER2-generated SPH increases the
cellular ROS levels remains unclear. Zigdon et al. [49]
demonstrated that an accumulation of DHS, a saturated

analog of SPH, due to a deficiency of (dihydro)ceramide
synthase 2 (CerS2) increases ROS levels in liver cells by
disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Whether
ACER2-generated SPH increases ROS levels through the
same mechanism is currently under investigations in our
laboratory.
In conclusion, our results present in this study
demonstrate that ACER2 is upregulated in p53-proficient
cancer cell lines but not p53-defieint cell lines in response
to DNA damage and that ACER2 upregulation mediates

PCD in response to a high degree of DNA damage by
accumulating SPH, a bioactive lipid that in turn induces
cellular ROS production. Moreover, we demonstrate
that either inhibiting the conversion of SPH to S1P or
increasing the generation of ceramides markedly enhances
the ability of the ACER2/SPH pathway to induce PCD
in cells. Based on these novel and important findings,
we envision that ACER2 activation in combination with
SPHK inhibition and ceramide induction represents a
novel modality in cancer prevention and therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNAi by lentiviral expression of shRNA

Reagents

Lentiviral vectors expressing an ACER2-specific
shRNA (shACER2) and a control shRNA (shCON),
respectively, were purchased from GeneCopoeia
(Rockville, MD, USA). These vectors were packaged into
lentiviral particles using HEK293T as host cells according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. HCT116 cells were
transduced with lentiviruses expressing shACER2 or
shRNA (shCON). To select cell lines that stably express
shACER2 or shCON, the transduced cells were grown
in puromycin-containing medium. Puromycin-resistant
clones expressing shACER2 or shCON were screened by
qPCR analysis for ACER2 mRNA levels and maintained
in puromycin-containing medium.

The anti-ACER2 antibody was raised against a
peptide located at the carboxyl terminal of ACER2 in our
laboratory [30]. Anti-calnexin antibody was purchased
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA), antibodies
against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved
caspase 3, and caspase 9 from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA). Minimal Essential Medium
(MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA,
Ca2+-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS), penicillin/
streptomycin solution, blasticidin, Zeocin, and G418 were
purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). All sphingolipids and the fluorescent sphingolipid
analogs used in this study were purchased from Avanti
Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Doxorubicin, 5-FU,
puromycin, cycloheximide, anti-β actin antibody, antiFLAG antibody, Staphylococcus aureus SMase, and other
unlisted chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA).

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy
kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and qPCR analyses were performed with primer pairs
specific ACER2 (5′-AGTGTCCTGTCTGCGGTTACG3′/5′-TGTTGTTGATGGCAGGCTTGAC-3′) or b-actin
(5′-CAATGTTCGGTGCAATTCAGAG-3′/5′-GGATCCC
ATTCCTACCACTGTG-3′) as described in our previous
studies [39]. qPCR results were analyzed using Q-Gene
software which expresses data as mean normalized
expression (MNE) [51]. MNE is directly proportional
to the amount of mRNA of a target gene relative to the
amount of mRNA of the reference gene (β-actin).

Cell culture
HEK293T, HCT116, HeLa, HT-29, MCF-7, MDAMB-231, A459, H1299, HepG2, and HEP3A were
cultured in DMEM or MEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and a 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (the standard
supplement). T-REx™-HeLa cells, a HeLa derivative that
stably expresses the tetracycline repressor protein, were
cultured in MEM supplemented with 5 μg/ml blasticidin
in addition to the standard supplement. HaCER2-TETON cells, a T-REx™-HeLa derivative that overexpresses
ACER2 under the control of a TET-ON system was
generated in our previous studies [30]. VEC-TET-ON
cells, another T-REx™-HeLa derivative which was stably
transfected with the empty TET-ON vector, was also
generated in our previous study. Both TET-ON cell lines
were cultured in MEM supplemented with blasticidin
(5  μg/ml) and Zeocin (25  μg/ml) in addition to the
standard supplement.

qPCR array
mRNA levels of major sphingolipid metabolizing
enzymes were profiled by a sphingolipid pathway-specific
qPCR array as described [31].

LC-MS/MS analysis for sphingolipids
Sphingolipids were analyzed by liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
as described (24) in the Lipidomics Core Facility at Stony
Brook University. Briefly, cells were harvested after being
washed with ice-cold 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4)
containing 150 mM NaCl. Fifty μl of a mixture (1 µM)
of internal sphingolipid standards (IS) including C17SPH,
C17SPH-1-phosphate, D-e-C16-ceramide (d17:1/16:0),
and D-e-18-ceramide (d17:1/18:0), was added to each
cell pellet sample before lipid extraction with 4 ml of
the ethyl acetate/iso-propanol/water (60/30/10%;v/v)
solvent system. After centrifugation, one ml of lipid
extracts from each sample was used for determination
of total phospholipids, and the remaining was used for
LC-MS/MS. The lipid extracts from each sample were
dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, dissolved in 100 μl
of acidified (0.2% formic acid) methanol, and injected on
the HP1100/TSQ 7000 LC/MS system and gradient-eluted

from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3-μm particle
size column, with a mobile phase system consisting of
1.0 mM methanolic ammonium formate/2 mM aqueous
ammonium formate. Peaks corresponding to the target
analytes and IS were collected and processed using the
Xcalibur software. Quantitative analyses of endogenous
sphingolipids (SPLs) were based on calibration curves
generated by spiking an artificial matrix with known
amounts of the synthetic target analyte standards and an
equal amount of the IS. The target analyte/IS peak area
ratios were compared to the calibration curves using a
linear regression model. Levels of a particular SPL were
normalized to inorganic phosphate (Pi) released from total
phospholipids, and expressed as SPL/Pi (pmol/μmol). Pi
was released from phospholipids by acid hydrolysis and
quantified as described [52, 53].

The number of viable cells was determined using
an  in vitro toxicology assay kit (MTT-based; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

LDH release assay
Plasma membrane permeability was assessed by the
release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cells using
Cytotoxicity Detection Kit PLUS (Roche Life Science)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed as described in
our previous study [30]. Briefly, cells were harvested by
treatment with a trypsin-EDTA solution and washed with
PBS. The harvested cells were fixed with 70% ethanol
cooled at –20oC, treated with DNase-free RNase, and
stained with propidium iodide (PI) before being analyzed
by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on a
FACStarplus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Protein concentration determination
Protein concentrations were determined with BSA as
a standard using a BCA protein determination kit (Pierce)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Ceramidase activity assay
Total membranes were isolated from cells and
were assayed for ceramidase activity assays with
different ceramides or ceramide analogs as substrates
as described in our previous study [54]. Briefly, acid
ceramidase activity encoded by ASAH1 was assayed at
pH 4.5 using D-e-C12-ceramide as a substrate. Neutral
ceramidase activity encoded by ASAH2 was assayed
at pH 7.4 using D-e-C12-NBD as a substrate in the
absence of Ca2+. Alkaline ceramidase activity encoded
by ACER1, ACER2, or ACER3 was assayed at pH 8.5
in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ using D-e-C12-NBDceramide, D-e-C16-ceramide, or D-ribo-C12-NBDceramide, respectively, as a substrate. SPH released from
regular ceramides was determined by LC-MS/MS and
NBD-fatty acid released from D-e-C12-NBD-ceramide or
D-ribo-C12-NBD-ceramide was determined by thin liquid
chromatography (TLC).

Propidium iodide and alexa aluor 488-annexin V
(PI/AA) co-staining
To detect apoptotic or necrotic cell death, cells were
harvested by treatment with a trypsin-EDTA solution,
washed with PBS, and stained with annexin V conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 488 (AA) followed by propidium
iodide (PI) using Alexa Fluor® 488 Annexin V/Dead
Cell Apoptosis Kits (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The stained cells were examined under a fluorescent
microscope to enumerate cells (200 in total per sample)
that were stained positively by AA (green fluorescence)
and/or PI (red fluorescence).

Caspase 3 activity assay
Caspase 3 activity was determined using DEVDconjugated with 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin
(AFC) (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according
to manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blot analysis
Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes,
which were then incubated with a primary antibody
followed by a secondary antibody-conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Protein bands were
detected with VisGlo™ Prime HRP Chemiluminescent
Substrate Kits (Amresco LLC, Solon, OH) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein band density
was determined by densitometry performed on the
imaging system Typhoon FLA 7000 (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences; Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

ROS assay
Intracellular ROS levels were measured with cellpermeable fluorogenic probe 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin
diacetate (DCFH-DA) using OxiSelect™ Intracellular
ROS Assay Kits (Green Fluorescence) (Cell Biolab Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, after being washed with PBS twice, cells
were incubated with DCFH-DA-containing medium at 37ºC
