Colorectal cancers (CRCs) often show a dense inﬁltrate of cytokine-producing immune/inﬂammatory cells. The exact contribution of
each immune cell subset and cytokine in the activation of the intracellular pathways sustaining CRC cell growth is not understood.
Herein, we isolate tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes (TILs) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) from the tumor area and the
macroscopically unaffected, adjacent, colonic mucosa of patients who underwent resection for sporadic CRC and show that the culture
supernatants of TILs, but not of LPMCs, potently enhance the growth of human CRC cell lines through the activation of the oncogenic
transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). Characterization of
immune cell complexity of TILs and LPMCs reveals no differences in the percentages of T cells, natural killer T cells, natural killer (NK)
cells, macrophages and B cells. However, T cells from TILs show a functional switch compared with those from LPMCs to produce large
amounts of T helper type 17 (Th17)-related cytokines (that is, interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and IL-6. Individual neutralization of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α or IL-6 does not change TIL-derived supernatant-driven
STAT3 and NF-kB activation, as well as their proproliferative effect in CRC cells. In contrast, simultaneous neutralization of both IL-17A
and TNF-α, which abrogates NF-kB signaling, and IL-22 and IL-6, which abrogates STAT3 signaling, reduces the mitogenic effect of
supernatants in CRC cells. IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 are also produced in excess in the early colonic lesions in a mouse
model of sporadic CRC, associated with enhanced STAT3/NF-kB activation. Mice therapeutically given BP-1-102, an orally bioavailable
compound targeting STAT3/NF-kB activation and cross-talk, exhibit reduced colon tumorigenesis and diminished expression of
STAT3/NF-kB-activating cytokines in the neoplastic areas. These data suggest that strategies aimed at the cotargeting of STAT3/NF-kB
activation and interaction between them might represent an attractive and novel approach to combat CRC.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancerrelated death in the western world.1 The development of CRC is a
multistage process, characterized by complex interactions
between environmental carcinogens, genetic alterations and the
host immune system, ultimately resulting in the uncontrolled
growth of transformed cells.2 Similar to other common malignancies (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, gastric cancer), chronic inﬂammation is an independent risk
factor for the development of CRC. For example, in patients with
ulcerative colitis, there is a marked increase in the incidence of
CRC.3 Experimental models of inﬂammation-associated colon
carcinogenesis suggest that inﬂammatory cell-derived cytokines
either directly or indirectly stimulate the growth of cancer
cells.4–10 Nevertheless, under speciﬁc inﬂammatory conditions,
immune cells can also mediate antitumor responses with the
downstream effect of eliminating dysplastic and cancerous
cells.11,12 Notably, sporadic CRC, which represent the majority of
CRC cases, exhibit extensive inﬂammatory inﬁltrates with high
levels of cytokine expression in the tumor microenvironment. In
this context, the production of interferon γ (IFN-γ) by T helper type
1 (Th1) CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and natural killer (NK) cells has been
demonstrated to limit tumor growth by activating cytotoxic

immunity,13–16 and the presence of Th1 polarization markers
correlates with reduced tumor recurrence in CRC patients.17 In
contrast, tumor speciﬁc upregulation of cytokines produced by
Th17 CD4+ cells, such as interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-22, is
detected in human CRC18–21 and studies in mouse models of
spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis have proven the importance
of these cytokines in facilitating tumor promotion and
progression.5,21,22 Consistently, a Th17 immune cell inﬁltrate
negatively inﬂuences the prognosis of CRC patients.23–25 Although
progress has been made, the molecular mechanisms by which
inﬂammation promotes CRC development are still being uncovered. This study was aimed at characterizing immune/inﬂammatory inﬁltrate and cytokine response in sporadic CRC and
determining the signaling pathways by which cytokines produced
by tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes (TILs) modulate CRC cell growth.

sporadic CRC and assessed whether TIL- and LPMC-derived
supernatants modulate CRC cell proliferation. TIL-derived supernatants induced a robust proliferation of both DLD-1 and HT-29
cells after 24 h as compared with LPMC-derived supernatants
(Figure 1a). No changes in the rate of DLD-1 or HT-29 cell death
were seen (not shown). Next, we investigated the mechanism/s
underlying this effect, and focused our attention on signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-kB), two transcription factors whose activation
modulates cell proliferation and survival in transformed cells.26
TIL-derived supernatants induced a more pronounced activation
of both STAT3 and NF-kB in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells compared with
LPMC-derived supernatants (Figure 1b). Immunoﬂuorescence
conﬁrmed STAT3 and NF-kB activation in DLD-1 cells and showed
a nuclear colocalization of the two activated transcription factors
in the presence of TIL-derived supernatants (Figure 1c). Similar
results were obtained in HT-29 cells (not shown). Parallel
experiments were performed in the presence of BP-1-102, a
STAT3 inhibitor that also represses nuclear NF-kB retention both
in vitro and in vivo, thereby attenuating NF-kB activation.27
Treatment of DLD-1 and HT-29 cells with BP-1-102 completely
suppressed STAT3 and NF-kB activation, as well as the proproliferative effect of TIL-derived supernatants on CRC cells (Figures 1d
and e).
CRC is massively inﬁltrated with T cells producing Th17-related
cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6
Next, LPMC- and TIL-derived supernatants were analyzed for
cytokines known to control cancer cell proliferation. Higher
expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 was found
in TIL-derived supernatants compared with LPMC-derived supernatants, whereas there was no difference in terms of IFN-γ
concentrations (Figure 2a). To ascertain whether these changes in
cytokine production reﬂected accumulation of speciﬁc immune
cell types in the tumor area, LPMCs and TILs were analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry. The percentage of CD3+CD8 − , CD3+CD8+, CD3
+CD56+, CD3 − CD56+, CD19+ and CD68+ cells did not differ
between LPMCs and TILs (Figure 2b). However, while TILs and
LPMCs contained similar fractions of IFN-γ-producing CD45+ cells,
the percentages of IL-17A-, IL-17F-, IL-21-, IL-22-, TNF-α- and IL-6expressing CD45+ cells were increased in TILs (Figure 2c). Further
analysis showed that, in both LPMCs and TILs, IFN-γ was mainly
produced by CD3+CD8 − and CD3+CD8+ cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). Lower production of IFN-γ by CD3+CD8 − cells and
higher production of IFN-γ derived from CD3+CD8+ cells was seen
in TILs as compared with LPMCs (Supplementary Figure 1). IL-17A,
IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-6 were almost totally derived from CD3
+CD8 − cells. TNF-α was also produced mainly by CD3+CD8 −
cells and, to a lesser extent, by CD3+CD8+ cells in both LPMCs and
TILs (Supplementary Figure 1). As the majority of IFN-γ, Th17related cytokine-, TNF-α- and IL-6-producing CD45+ cells in both
TILs and LPMCs were CD3+CD8 − and CD3+CD8+ cells, we
restricted our further analysis to these cell types. The percentage
of IFN-γ-producing CD3+CD8 − cells was not different between
TILs and LPMCs (Figure 3a). In contrast, the percentage of CD3
+CD8 − cells expressing IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6
was increased in TILs (Figure 3a). Next, we assessed the expression
of T-bet and receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) in
CD3+CD8 − cells in TILs and LPMCs. The majority of CD3+CD8 −
cells coexpressed T-bet and RORγt both in TILs and LPMCs
(Figure 3b). In contrast, TIL samples contained more T-bet-/RORγt+
CD3+CD8 − cells and less T-bet+/RORγt − CD3+CD8 − cells than
LPMC samples (Figure 3b). As expected, T-bet+/RORγt − CD3
+CD8 − cells produced IFN-γ but not IL-17A, whereas T-bet − /
RORγt+ CD3+CD8 − cells produced IL-17A but not IFN-γ. Doublepositive T-bet/RORγt CD3+CD8 − cells coexpressed both IFN-γ and
IL-17A, whereas double-negative T-bet/RORγt CD3+CD8 − cells
Oncogene (2015) 3493 – 3503

produced neither IFN-γ nor IL-17A (Figure 3c). Further analysis of
cytokine production revealed that the double-positive T-bet/
RORγt CD3+CD8 − cells were the major source of IFN-γ, Th17related cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 in both TILs and LPMCs
(Figure 3d). However, TILs contained higher fraction of T-bet − /
RORγt+ CD3+CD8 − cells producing Th17 cytokines, TNF-α and
IL-6, as compared with LPMCs (Figure 3d). A higher fraction of IFNγ- and TNF-α-producing CD3+CD8+ cells was also observed in TILs
as compared with LPMCs, whereas IL-17A-, IL-17F-, IL-21-, IL-22and IL-6-producing CD3+CD8+ cells were barely detectable in
both TILs and LPMCs (Supplementary Figure 2A). The majority of
CD3+CD8+ cells in both TILs and LPMCs coexpressed T-bet and
RORγt (Supplementary Figure 2B). In contrast, TIL samples
contained more T-bet+/RORγt+ CD3+CD8+ cells and less T-bet
+/RORγt − CD3+CD8+ cells than LPMC samples (Supplementary
Figure 2B). Analysis of cytokine production revealed that doublepositive T-bet/RORγt CD3+CD8+ cells were the major source of
IFN-γ and TNF-α in both TILs and LPMCs (Supplementary Figure
2C). Altogether, these ﬁndings show that transition from the
uninvolved colonic mucosa to the neoplastic area is marked by a
shift in the CD3+CD8 − and CD3+CD8+ cell phenotype leading to
the accumulation of Th17-related cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6.
IL-17A, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 activate STAT3 and NF-kB and
contribute to the TIL-derived culture supernatant-mediated CRC
cell proliferation
IL-22 and IL-6 activated STAT3 in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells, whereas
activation of NF-kB was seen in cells stimulated with IL-17A or
TNF-α. In contrast, no activation of STAT3 and NF-kB was seen in
cells stimulated with IL-17F or IL-21 (Figure 4a). Both these
cytokines were however biologically active, as IL-17F induced IL-6
in stromal cell cultures and IL-21 activated STAT3 in human LPMCs
(not shown). To investigate the contribution of Th17-related
cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, in TIL-derived supernatant-driven CRC
cell growth, supernatants were preincubated with neutralizing
anti-cytokine antibodies before adding to CRC cell lines. Initially,
we veriﬁed the functional activity of each neutralizing antibody by
testing its ability to suppress the function of the corresponding
cytokine in cultures of CRC cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
Blockade of IL-6 partially reduced p-STAT3 Y705, but not p-NFkB/p65 Ser536, in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells cultured with TIL-derived
supernatants. In contrast, individual neutralization of IL-17A,
IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 or TNF-α did not change TIL-derived supernatant-driven STAT3 and NF-kB activation (Figure 4b). Moreover,
no signiﬁcant change in TIL-derived supernatant-driven CRC cell
growth was seen by the blockade of a single cytokine (Figure 4c).
Next, we assessed the effect of neutralization of multiple cytokines
on STAT3 and NF-kB activation as well as on the promitogenic
effect of TIL-derived supernatants. Neutralization of both IL-17A
and TNF-α did not alter activation of STAT3 and NF-kB nor TILderived supernatant-induced CRC cell proliferation (Figures 4d
and e). Both anti-IL-22 and anti-IL-6 reduced TIL-derived supernatant-driven p-STAT3 Y705 but not p-NF-kB/p65 Ser536, and this
was associated with a decreased CRC cell growth (Figures 4d and
e). Simultaneous neutralization of IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-22 and IL-6
reduced both STAT3 and NF-kB activation and signiﬁcantly
inhibited growth of cells induced by TIL-derived supernatants
compared with cells preincubated with anti-IL-22 and anti-IL-6
(Figures 4d and e). No change in cell viability was observed, thus
ruling out the possibility that changes in cell proliferation were
secondary to induction of cell death (data not shown).

gene, which spontaneously develop intestinal tumors. Treatment
of Apcmin/+ mice with the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)
increased tumor incidence, number and size, particularly in the
colon.28 First, we examined the activation status of STAT3 and
Oncogene (2015) 3493 – 3503

NF-kB and the expression of IFN-γ, Th17-related cytokines, TNF-α
and IL-6 in early colonic lesions of Apcmin/+ mice. Some animals
were treated intraperitoneally with AOM (10 mg/kg) once a week
for 2 weeks and killed on day 21 (Supplementary Figure 4A).
Both STAT3 and NF-kB were activated in early colonic lesions of
Apcmin/+ mice (Supplementary Figures 4B–D). Microscopic examination of colonic sections revealed the accumulation of cells
positive for p-STAT3 Y705 and p-NF-kB/p65 Ser536 in both
transformed epithelial cells and tumor-inﬁltrating cells
(Supplementary Figures 4C and D). STAT3 and NF-kB activation
in early colonic lesions of Apcmin/+ mice was associated with
elevated levels of transcripts for IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6,
whereas IFN-γ and IL-17F RNA transcripts remained unchanged
(Supplementary Figure 5). Early colonic lesions of Apcmin/+ mice
also exhibited elevated RNA levels of IL-11, a cytokine produced
by cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts and myeloid cells and involved in
CRC progression (Supplementary Figure 5).29 Phenotypic analysis
of immune cells in TILs isolated from the tumors of Apcmin/+ mice
showed a preferential accumulation of CD3+CD8 − cells in line
with the human data (Supplementary Figure 6).
Next, we tested whether BP-1-102 could inhibit intestinal
tumorigenesis in Apcmin/+ mice. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with AOM (10 mg/kg) once a week for 2 weeks. Two weeks
after the last AOM injection, mice were randomly divided into two
groups and given either BP-1-102 (in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) or 1% DMSO in PBS
(control) three times a week by oral gavage until being killed (day
56) (Figure 5a). Three control mice had to be killed before the end
of the scheduled treatment, because of intestinal occlusion caused
by large colonic tumors, whereas all mice treated with BP-1-102
survived until the end of the study.
Endoscopy on day 54 showed that control mice developed
multiple large tumors, whereas the number and size of tumors
were reduced in the colon of BP-1-102-treated mice (Figure 5b).
These results were conﬁrmed by direct assessment of tumors in
mice killed on day 56 (unpublished data). Proliferating cell nuclear
antigen staining conﬁrmed the antiproliferative effect of BP-1-102
(Figure 5c). By contrast, there was no signiﬁcant change in
proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining in the normal colonic
mucosa of mice treated with BP-1-102 (Figure 5c). To determine
whether the reduced tumorigenesis observed in BP-1-102-treated
mice was associated with a reduced activation of STAT3 and/or
NF-kB, we compared p-STAT3 Y705 and p-NF-kB/p65 Ser536
expression in non-tumor and tumor tissue derived from colonic
extracts of control and BP-1-102-treated mice killed on day 56.
Robust activation of both STAT3 and NF-kB was seen in the
neoplastic areas of control mice and inhibited by BP-1-102
treatment, whereas p-STAT3 Y705 and p-NF-kB/p65 Ser536
expression was barely detectable in non-tumor areas of both
control and BP-1-102-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7).
Immunohistochemistry conﬁrmed reduced activation of both
STAT3 and NF-kB in colonic tumor sections of mice treated with
BP-1-102 (Figure 6a). IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 transcripts
were reduced in the tumor areas of BP-1-102-treated mice,
whereas IFN-γ and IL-17F RNA expression remained unchanged
(Figure 6b). Moreover, treatment of mice with BP-1-102 did not
change IL-11 transcripts in the tumors as well as the fractions of
immune cells in TILs (not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study was undertaken to characterize the immune/inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in sporadic CRC and to clarify which factors
released by TILs modulate CRC cell growth and survival. Initially,
we showed that TIL-derived supernatants, but not LPMC-derived
supernatants, increased proliferation of DLD-1 and HT-29 cells and
this was associated with the activation of STAT3 and NF-kB, two
transcription factors involved in the interplay between malignant

cells and inﬂammatory/immune cells. To ascertain the role of
STAT3 and NF-kB activation in the proproliferative effect mediated
by TIL-derived supernatant, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were treated

with BP-1-102, which disrupts STAT3 dimerization, thereby
inhibiting its activation.27 BP-1-102 also represses NF-kB transcriptional functions as well as STAT3-NF-kB cross-talk in human breast

and lung cancer cells.27 Indeed, preincubation of DLD-1 and HT-29
cells with BP-1-102 suppressed STAT3 and NF-kB activation and
abrogated TIL-derived supernatant-induced cell growth.
The ability of immune/inﬂammatory cells to control cancer cell
proliferation is mostly dependent on cytokines, which directly
target CRC cells. Our results indicate that TILs produce elevated
levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6. Characterization of immune cell complexity of sporadic CRC and adjacent
normal colonic tissues revealed no changes in the percentages of
different cell subsets and suggested that changes in the features

of speciﬁc immune cell subsets might account for the increased
production of Th17-related cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6.
Following triggering of their T-cell receptor and in the presence
of appropriate costimulatory signals and speciﬁc cytokines, naive

the transcription factor T-bet and produce IFN-γ,31 whereas Th17

obtained is shown. NT, non-tumor area; T, tumor area.

Th cells producing IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6
accumulate in TILs. Interestingly, the majority of Th cells in both
TILs and LPMCs coexpressed T-bet and RORγt. However, doublepositive T-bet/RORγt Th cells in TILs produced higher amount of
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 than those in LPMCs.
CD8+ T cells have a crucial role in tumor immunity resulting in
part from the release of different cytotoxic molecules (for
example, granzyme B, perforin). However, besides cytotoxic
activity, CD8+ T cells expressing RORγt have been reported to
produce Th17-related cytokines that sustain tumor growth.34 Flow
cytometry analysis revealed that double-positive T-bet/RORγt CD8
+ cells, which produce high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, accumulate
in TILs. In contrast, the production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22
and IL-6 was barely detectable in CD8+ cells in both TILs and
LPMCs. Although cytokines in the tumor microenvironment are
produced mostly by hematopoietic cells, some of the cytokines
such as IL-6 and TNF-α can also be produced by the malignant
cells themselves to establish an autocrine tumor-promoting
signaling loop that further enhances NF-kB and STAT3
activation.26 However, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells did not produce
IL-6 and TNF-α in the presence or absence of TIL-derived
supernatants (unpublished observations).
In subsequent studies, we tested the ability of each of the
cytokines overproduced by TILs to activate STAT3 and/or NF-kB in
DLD-1 and HT-29 cells. IL-22 and IL-6 activated STAT3 in both cells
lines, whereas activation of NF-kB was seen in cells stimulated with
IL-17A or TNF-α. These results are consistent with the notion that
STAT3 as well as NF-kB activators are redundant in cancer cells
and ﬁt with our demonstration that single neutralization of IL-17A,
IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 did not affect the ability of TIL-derived
supernatants to activate STAT3 and NF-kB and promote CRC cell

proliferation. Combined neutralization of IL-22 and IL-6 reduced
but did not abrogate TIL supernatant-induced STAT3 activation
and CRC cell proliferation, probably because of the presence of
additional STAT3-activating cytokines/factors in TIL-derived supernatants (for example, IL-11 or EGF). In contrast, combined
neutralization of IL-17A and TNF-α only slightly affected NF-kB
activation and the proproliferative effect of TIL-derived supernatants, and this again could be related to the presence of other
NF-kB-activating cytokines/factors (for example, IL-1β) in TILderived supernatants. Another possibility is that the simultaneous
activation of STAT3 in these cells could sustain NF-kB activity as it
was demonstrated that STAT3 prolongs NF-kB nuclear retention
through acetyltransferase p300-mediated p65 acetylation.35 Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-22 and IL-6
almost completely blocked STAT3 and NF-kB activation and the
increased CRC cell growth induced by TIL-derived supernatants.
These results collectively indicate that TILs secrete multiple
cytokines that exert mitogenic effects because of their ability to
trigger simultaneously STAT3 and NF-kB in CRC cells. Our data also
conﬁrm that inhibition of STAT3 is much more important than
inhibition of NF-kB in the negative control of CRC cell
growth.4,36,37
Our in vitro results were supported by studies in Apcmin/+ mice
showing that inhibition of STAT3 and NF-kB with BP-1-102
reduced the growth of colonic tumors. Although BP-1-102 is a
speciﬁc inhibitor of STAT3 activity, BP-1-102-mediated downregulation of NF-kB activation relies on the demonstration that
STAT3 interacts with and sustains NF-kB activity.35 STAT3 and
NF-kB activation was seen in both tumor cells and tumorinﬁltrating immune cells in early colonic lesions of Apcmin/+ mice
and both transcription factors can regulate not only the cancer cell

behavior but also the production of cytokines and other
inﬂammatory mediators by immune cells.38,39 Mice given BP-1102 exhibited reduced levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines in the
tumor areas, probably based on the fact that, in immune cells, the
activity of STAT3 either directly or indirectly controls the
production of Th17-related cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α.40–42
Because STAT3 is required for the survival of intestinal epithelial
cells and maintenance of mucosal integrity,4 excessive interference with systemic STAT3 activation could potentially cause
gastrointestinal damage. However, we show here that BP-1-102
inhibited the proliferation of neoplastic cells but not normal
colonic crypt cells, and did not affect normal mucosal regeneration processes. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that BP-1-102
interferes exclusively with the excessive STAT3 and NF-kB
activation that sustains colon carcinogenesis.
Taken together, our data show that transition from the
uninvolved colonic mucosa to the neoplastic area is marked by
a shift in the Th program leading to the accumulation of IL-17A,
IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 that ultimately sustain CRC cell growth
through the activation of STAT3 and NF-kB. Although reagents
that inhibit the above-mentioned cytokines are already available
and most have been found to be safe and effective for treatment
of autoimmune disorders,43 our data suggest that single
neutralization of STAT3- and/or NF-kB-activating cytokines may
not be effective owing to the redundant effects of such molecules
on target cells.
In this context, compounds inhibiting simultaneously STAT3
and NF-kB (for example, BP-1-102) might help combat CRC, given
that these drugs not only affect growth of malignant cells but also
negatively regulate production of protumorigenic cytokines by
tumor-inﬁltrating cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and samples
Paired tissue samples were taken from the tumor area and the
macroscopically unaffected, adjacent, colonic mucosa of 14 patients who
underwent colon resection for sporadic CRC (all with TNM stages II–III) at
the Tor Vergata University Hospital (Rome, Italy). These samples were used
to extract TILs and LPMCs as described below. No patients received
radiotherapy or chemotherapy before undergoing surgery. The human
studies were approved by the local ethics committee and each patient
gave written informed consent.

Animals
Apcmin/+ mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME,
USA) and maintained in ﬁlter-topped cages on autoclaved food and water
at the Plaisant animal facility (Rome, Italy). Mice were routinely tested
(every 3 months) for health status and infections according to the
Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA)
guidelines. Mice were negative for all pathogens included in this protocol.
Mice were also negative for Helicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis. All
animal experiments were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.

Isolation of LPMCs and TILs from human colonic samples
TILs and LPMCs were isolated from CRC samples and adjacent, normal,
colonic mucosa using dithiothreitol–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and
collagenase method. Brieﬂy, pieces of intestinal mucosa and tumor tissue
were dissected from surgical specimens within 1 h of resection and
washed in Hank’s balanced salt solution containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and
antibiotics for 15 min at room temperature to remove mucus. Samples
were then minced and incubated in Hank’s balanced salt solution
containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and antibiotics for
45 min at 37 °C to remove epithelial cells. After two washes in Hank’s
balanced salt solution, samples were incubated in type D collagenase
(0.75 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostic, Monza, Italy) for 1 h at 37 °C. After
collagenase digestion, media containing the mononuclear cells were
collected and washed two times in Hank’s balanced salt solution.

Subsequently, the pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 and then
layered on a Percoll density gradient as described previously44 to isolate
either LPMCs or TILs. The isolated cells were counted and checked for
viability using 0.1% trypan blue (viability ranged from 89 to 97%).

Assessment of cell proliferation and death
Cell proliferation was assessed by using a commercially available
5-bromodeoxyuridine assay kit (Roche Diagnostic) and conﬁrmed by ﬂow
cytometry using carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Life
Technologies, Milan, Italy) as described previously.45 The percentage of
cell death was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry at the same time point of cell
proliferation after staining with propidium iodide.

Cell cultures
All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) unless speciﬁed. The
human CRC cell lines DLD-1 and HT-29 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI 1640 and McCoy’s
5A medium, respectively, all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), and 50 μg/
ml gentamicin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, fully humidiﬁed incubator. Cell lines have
been recently authenticated by STR DNA ﬁngerprinting using the
PowerPlex 18D System Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The STR proﬁles of all the cell lines matched
the known DNA ﬁngerprints.
Freshly isolated TILs and LPMCs were resuspended in complete RPMI
1640 medium. One million LPMCs or TILs were cultured in 48-well plates to
produce 0.5 ml of supernatant. Cell-free supernatants were harvested after
48 h. To characterize the immune cell subsets and their cytokine
production, an aliquot of cells was cultured in the presence of phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (80 pM), ionomycin (1 mg/ml) and monensin (2 μM;
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 5 h, and then assessed by ﬂow
cytometry following staining with speciﬁc ﬂuorochrome-conjugated
antibodies.
To examine whether LPMC- and TIL-derived supernatants affect CRC cell
proliferation and/or viability, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were cultured in the
presence of either LPMC- or TIL-derived supernatants or RPMI 1640
medium (vehicle) (all used at 1:20 ﬁnal dilution) for 24 h.
To assess whether LPMC- and TIL-derived supernatants activate STAT3
and/or NF-kB in CRC cells, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were cultured in the
presence of either LPMC- or TIL-derived supernatants or RPMI 1640
medium (vehicle) (all used at 1:20 ﬁnal dilution) for 15 min.
To investigate whether the TIL-derived supernatant-mediated increase
of CRC cell proliferation relies on STAT3 and NF-kB activation, DLD-1 and
HT-29 cells were preincubated either with BP-1-102 (1 and 3 μg/ml,
respectively) or DMSO (vehicle) for 1 h and then stimulated either with
TIL-derived supernatants or RPMI 1640 medium (vehicle) (both used at 1:20
ﬁnal dilution). After 15 min, STAT3 and NF-kB activation was evaluated by
western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed after 24 h by 5bromodeoxyuridine assay.
To determine whether Th17-related cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 activate
STAT3 and/or NF-kB in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells, cells were stimulated with
recombinant human IL-17A (Peprotech, London, UK), IL-17F (Peprotech),
IL-21 (Life Technologies), IL-22 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), IL-6
(Peprotech) or TNF-α (R&D Systems) (all used at 25 ng/ml) for 15 min.
STAT3 and NF-kB activation was assessed by western blotting.
To assess the contribution of each Th17-related cytokines, TNF-α and
IL-6 in TIL-derived supernatant-mediated increase of CRC cell proliferation,
TIL-derived supernatants were preincubated with speciﬁc antibodies
neutralizing IL-17A (anti-IL-17A; R&D Systems), IL-17F (anti-IL-17F; Acris
Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany), IL-21 (anti-IL-21; Giuliani SpA, Milan,
Italy), IL-22 (anti-IL-22; R&D Systems), TNF-α (anti-TNF-α; R&D Systems) and
IL-6 (anti-IL-6; R&D Systems) (all used at 10 μg/ml) and then added to
DLD-1 and HT-29 cells. After 15 min, STAT3 and NF-kB activation was
evaluated by western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed after 24 h by
5-bromodeoxyuridine.

Western blotting
Total proteins were extracted from human CRC cells or mouse colonic
tissues as described elsewhere,45 and separated on sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Blots were incubated with
p-STAT3 Tyr705, p-NF-κB/p65 Ser536 (both from Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA), STAT3 and p65 antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Oncogene (2015) 3493 – 3503

Santa Cruz, CA, USA). To ascertain equivalent loading of the lanes, blots
were stripped and incubated with an anti-β-actin antibody.

Isolation of TILs from mouse colon tumors
TILs were isolated from colon tumors of Apcmin/+ mice as previousy
described.10

Immunoﬂuorescence
CRC cells were grown on glass coverslips in multiwell plates and cultured
in the presence of either LPMC- or TIL-derived supernatants or RPMI 1640
medium (vehicle) (all used at 1:20 ﬁnal dilution) for 15 min. Cells were ﬁxed
with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, blocked in 1% bovine
serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with anti-p-STAT3 Tyr705 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p-NF-κB/p65 Ser536 antibody (Cell Signaling)
in 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, cells
were rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 (goat antimouse) and Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-rabbit) (both from Life
Technologies) for p-STAT3 Tyr705 and p-NF-κB/p65 Ser536 detection,
respectively, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Specimens were
then washed with PBS, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Life Technologies), mounted and examined using a ﬂuorescence
microscope (Olympus, Milan, Italy).

Analysis of cytokine expression in LPMC- and TIL-derived
supernatants
Freshly isolated TILs and LPMCs were resuspended and cultured in
complete RPMI 1640 medium and the cell-free supernatants were
harvested after 48 h. IFN-γ, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems). IL-21 protein concentrations
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience).

RNA extraction, cDNA preparation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tumor and non-tumor tissue of Apcmin/+
mice using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Life Technology). Primers used were as follows: IFN-γ—sense, 5′-CAAT
AGACGCTACACACTGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCACATCTATGCCACTTGAG-3′;
IL-17A—sense, 5′-TCAGACTACCTCAACCGTTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TTCAGG
ACCAGGATCTCTTG-3′; IL-17F—sense, 5′-CCAAAACCAGGGCATTTCTGTC-3′
and antisense, 5′-GAGTTCATGGTGCTGTCTTCC-3′; TNF-α—sense, 5′-ACCCT
CACACTCAGATCATC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAGTAGACAAGGTACAACCC-3′;
IL-6—sense, 5′-AGCCAGAGTCCTTCAGAGAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-GATGG
TCTTGGTCCTTAGCC-3′; IL-11—sense, 5′-GCTTCCTGGTGTGCTGAC-3′ and
antisense, 5′-CCAGGCGAGACATCAAGAG-3′. IL-21 and IL-22 RNA expression was evaluated using a TaqMan assay (Life Technologies). RNA
expression was calculated relative to the housekeeping β-actin gene on
the base of the ΔΔCt algorithm.

Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. and results were analyzed using the
two-tailed Student's t-test for comparison between two groups or one-way
analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple
comparisons. Signiﬁcance was deﬁned as P-values o0.05.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.

Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry analysis was performed by using a BD FACSVerse (BD
Biosciences, Milan, Italy) and the following monoclonal anti-human
antibodies: CD45-APC-H7, CD3ε-PerCP, CD3ε-FITC, CD8α-V500, CD56V450, CD56-PE-Cy7, CD19-FITC, IFN-γ-FITC, IFN-γ-PE, IL-17A-V450, IL-17FPE, TNFα-PE (all from BD Pharmingen, Milan, Italy), IL-21-PE, IL-22-APC, IL-6PerCP, T-bet-PE-Cy7 (clone 4B10), RORγt-APC (clone AFKJS-9), RORγt-PE
(clone AFKJS-9) (all from eBioscience) and CD68 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA,
USA). TILs isolated from mouse colon tumors were stained with the
following antibodies: CD3ε-Paciﬁc Blue, CD8α-FITC, CD45-APC-Cy7, CD49bPE (clone DX5), CD19-APC (all from BD Pharmingen) and F4/80-Paciﬁc Blue
(BioLegend). In parallel, cells were stained with the respective control
isotype antibodies.

Experimental model of sporadic CRC
Cohoused 6- to 7-week-old female Apcmin/+ mice received intraperitoneal
injections of 10 mg/kg AOM once a week for 2 weeks to increase colon
tumorigenesis as previously reported.28 Two weeks after the last AOM
injection, some mice were killed and tumor and non-tumor colonic tissues
collected to perform real-time PCR, western blotting and histochemistry
experiments. The remaining mice were randomly divided into two groups
and given either 5 mg/kg BP-1-102 (in 1% DMSO in PBS) or 1% DMSO in
PBS (control) every 2 days by oral gavage (100 μl) until being killed on day
56. The dose of BP-1-102 was selected in accordance with a previous report
by Zhang et al.27 Colonoscopy was performed in a blinded manner for
monitoring of tumorigenesis using the Coloview high-resolution mouse
endoscopic system (Karl-Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Tumors observed
during endoscopy were counted to obtain the overall number of lesions.
Tumor sizes of all tumors in a given mouse were scored using the protocol
described by Becker et al.46

Immunohistochemistry
Colonic cryosections of Apcmin/+ mice were stained with p-STAT3 Tyr705
and p-NF-κB/p65 Ser536 (both from Cell Signaling). Isotype control-stained
sections were prepared under identical conditions replacing the primary
antibody with a rabbit IgG control antibody (R&D Systems). Proliferating
cells were evaluated using a PCNA Staining Kit (Zymed Laboratories,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative
control-stained sections were prepared under identical immunohistochemical conditions omitting the primary antibody.
