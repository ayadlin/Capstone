Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Missing in metastasis (MIM) is a member of newly emerged inverse BAR-domain protein family
and a putative metastasis suppressor. Although reduced MIM expression has been associated with
bladder, breast, gastric cancers, evidence for the role of MIM in tumor progression remains scarce
and controversial. Herein we characterized a MIM knockout mouse strain and observed that MIM
deficient mice often developed enlarged spleens. Autopsy and histological analysis revealed that
nearly 78% of MIM(−/−) mice developed tumors with features similar to diffuse large B
lymphoma during a period from one to two years. MIM(−/−) mice also exhibited abnormal
distribution of B cells in lymphoid organs with decrease in the spleen but increase in the bone
marrow and the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the bone marrow of MIM(−/−) mice contained a
higher percentage of pre-B2 cells but fewer immature B-cells than wild type mice. In response to
CXCL13, a B-cell chemokine released from splenic stromal cells, MIM deficient B-cells did not
undergo chemotaxis or morphologic changes in response to the chemokine and also did not
internalize CXCR5, the receptor of CXCL13. Microarray analyses demonstrated that MIM is the
only member of the I-BAR domain family that was highly expressed in human B cells. However,
low or absent MIM expression was common in either primary B-cell malignancies or established
B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphomas. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time an
important role for MIM in B-cell development and suggests that predisposition of MIM null mice
to lymphomagenesis may involve aberrant interactions between B lineage cells and the lymphoid
microenvironment.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metastasis suppressors negatively regulate a broad set of cellular activities pertinent to
metastasis, such as tumor cell spreading, dormancy, angiogenesis and survival in new
microenvironments (Bodenstine and Welch 2008). Like tumor suppressors, expression of
metastasis suppressors is often reduced in metastatic cells as compared to non-metastatic
counterparts. One such metastasis suppressor is the missing in metastasis (MIM; also known
as metastasis suppressor 1 [MTSS1]) gene, expression of which is frequently silent in a
subset of metastatic cell lines originating from bladder, breast and prostate cancers (Lee et al
2002, Loberg et al 2005, Nixdorf et al 2004, Parr and Jiang 2009). Recent studies with
human cancers have revealed that the loss of MIM expression occurs in 69% of advanced
bladder cancers (Wang et al 2007) and 88% of metastatic gastric cancers (Liu et al 2010).
Also, MIM expression is considerably upregulated by TBX5, a newly identified tumor
suppressor in colon cancers (Yu et al 2010). In breast and gastric cancers, low levels of
MIM expression correlate with poor prognosis and may have predictive value for the
disease-free survival (Liu et al 2010, Parr and Jiang 2009). However, evidence supporting a
pathological role of MIM in tumorigenesis remains fragmentary and sometimes
controversial. For example, overexpression of MIM and amplification of the human MIM
locus at human chromosome 8q24.1 was found in hepatocellular carcinomas and ovarian
carcinomas, respectively (Ma et al 2007, Nowee et al 2007), and increased MIM
immunoreactivity was associated with advanced colorectal cancers (Wang et al 2011). MIM
was also identified as a Sonic hedgehog responsive gene (Callahan et al 2004), a signaling
pathway normally implicated in tumorigenesis (Bailey et al 2007). In this study, we
characterized a MIM knockout (KO) mouse strain and observed a defect in the motility of
MIM depleted B cells in response to a splenic chemokine and efficient recruitment to the
spleen. Furthermore, the aging MIM KO mice have a predisposition to the formation of Bcell lymphoma. Our data suggests that MIM plays a unique role in the development and
function of B lymphocytes, and MIM depletion may promote lymphomagenesis through
eliciting aberrant interactions between B lineage cells and their microenvironment.

Results and Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have recently generated a complete MIM knockout mouse strain using a gene trapping
vector (Dan Yu 2011). MIM(−/−) mice developed normally and were fertile, but the survival
rate of MIM(−/−) mice was significantly lower than that of wild type mice. The majority of
the homozygous knockout animals died between 14 to 24 months, and heterozygous mice
also died slightly earlier than wild type animals (Fig. 1A). Biopsies of many sick or
moribund old animals revealed that they had developed abnormal tissue structures (Table 1).
Notably, 81% of the animals had enlarged spleens (Table 1, Fig. S1A), which were also seen
in young mice at the ages between 4 to 8 weeks (Fig. 1B). The splenomegly was not due to a
possible increase in their sizes because the body weight of MIM(−/−) mice was apparently
normal at young (Fig. 1C) or old ages (data not shown). In addition to enlarged spleens, 56%
of the aged animals also exhibited hepatomegaly with rough liver surfaces (Table 1, Fig.
S1B), although hepatomegaly was not observed in young mice. Also, about 70% MIM(−/−)
mice developed enlarged lymph nodes or spleens infiltrated by abnormal lymphoid cells
with vesicular nuclei, abundant cytoplasm and small nucleoli (Fig. 2A), a morphology that
was distinct from normal lymphocytes in lymph nodes or spleen (Fig. 2C and D), and was
consistent with murine diffuse large B lymphoma according to Bethesda classifications
(Morse et al 2002). The majority of the infiltrating cells expressed CD20 (Fig. 2B and Fig.
S2A) or B220 (Fig. S2B), but were negative for CD3, a T-cell marker (data not shown). The
tumor cells expressed CD19 (B-cell marker) and CD5 (expressed in naïve and memory B
lymphomas) (Fig. S3A), indicating that they were derived from CD5+ B-cells. To determine
the monoclonal nature associated with malignant lymphomas, the tumors harvested from

three MIM(−/−) mice were analyzed by PCR for the VDJ rearrangement of immunoglobulin
(Ig) heavy chain genes. As shown in Fig. S3B, the genomic DNA from a wild type spleen
yielded three prominent PCR products of 1.3, 1.0 and 0.7 kb, corresponding to DJH1, DJH2
and DJH3 Ig gene rearrangements, respectively (Chang et al 1992). Another expected band
of 0.12 kb corresponding to DJH4 was barely detectable, presumably due to low resolution
in the agarose gel. However, the DNAs of three lymphomas generated only one dominant
PCR product, which migrated at the position of DJH3, indicating that these tumors were
monoclonal. Some aged MIM(−/−) mice also displayed infiltrated leukocytes in the liver
and the kidney (Table 1), which contained a mixture of small T- and B-cells (Fig. S2E and
F).

MIM was highly expressed in murine splenic B cells but weakly in splenic T cells (Fig. 3A).
Because lymphomas are often associated with aberrant differentiation of B cells (Shaffer et
al 2002), we thought that MIM depletion could affect B-cell development in different
lymphoid organs. Indeed, about 50% decrease in the percentage of CD19+ B cells in the
spleen of MIM(−/−) mice was observed (Fig. 3B and 3C). Conversely, the population of B
cells was increased by ~20% in the bone marrow and more significantly in the peripheral
blood of MIM(−/−) mice (Fig. 3C). Complete blood count analysis revealed normal ranges
of most types of hematopoietic cells in MIM(−/−) mice, although the count of white blood
cells in MIM(−/−) mice was evidently higher than that of wild type mice (Table S1). We
also analyzed several markers of early B-cell development stages in the bone marrow. While
bone marrow of MIM(−/−) mice contained a normal percentage of pre-B1 cells
(CD19+CD117+/CD25−) (Martensson et al. 2010; Rolink 2004), the percentage of pre-B2
cells (CD19+/CD117−/CD25+) was 35% higher than that of the wild type mice (Fig. 4A).
The population of B cells expressing s-IgM was also reduced by 22% in the bone marrow
(Fig. 4A and B) and by 73% in the spleens (Fig. 4B) of MIM(−/−) mice. The percentage of
B cells with s-IgD, the marker for a relatively more mature form of naïve B cells, was also
significantly decreased in the MIM depleted spleens (Fig. 4C). The reduction of B-cell
populations could be caused by replacement of normal B cells with tumor cells. However,
we found no apparent tumor-like cells in either the bone marrow or the blood of young mice,
suggesting that reduced B cells likely reflected an aberrant B-cell differentiation or altered
affinity for different lymphoid organs in MIM deficient mice.

B-cell development is guided by a series of interactions between B lineage cells and a
variety of cytokines or chemokines released from stromal cells in the bone marrow and
lymphoid organs (LeBien and Tedder 2008). We therefore examined the response of naïve
splenic B cells to CXCL13, a primary B-cell chemokine normally released from splenic
stromal cells. In Transwell chambers, wild type B cells had nearly 5-fold higher directional
migration towards the CXCL13-containing chamber. Yet, MIM(−/−) B cells failed to do so
under the same conditions (Fig. 4D and E) even though they expressed a normal level of
CXCR5, the receptor for CXCL13, (Fig. S4). It was also possible that the impaired motility
response was caused by the targeting vector used in the generation of this mouse strain (Dan
Yu 2011). Yet, the heterozygous B cells, which contained a single copy of the targeting
vector, migrated slightly slower than wild type cells, the difference was not statistically
significant (Fig. 4F).
We have recently observed that MIM depleted embryonic fibroblasts were less polarized
and partially impaired in the receptor-mediated endocytosis (Dan Yu 2011). To examine
whether MIM depletion also affects B-cell shape changes, we inspected splenic B cells in
response to CXCL13 by phase microscopy. While nearly 57% of wild type B cells were
markedly polarized upon CXCL13 treatment, the majority of MIM(−/−) B cells retained
their rounded morphology (Fig. S5). We also examined endocytosis of CXCR5 and found
that MIM(−/−) B cells failed to internalize the receptor after exposed to CXCL13 for 20 min

(Fig. S4). These data suggest that MIM is required for B cells to respond to chemokines by
modulation of cell shapes and endocytosis, and that MIM depletion may impair B-cell
development by evoking an aberrant communication between B cells and stromal cells.
To determine whether MIM plays a role in human B cells, we analyzed the expression of
MIM and other I-BAR domain family members (Abba, IRSp53, IRTKS and FLJ22582) in a
series of hematopoietic cells from healthy adult blood donors, including B cells, T cells,
monocytes and granulocytes (Fig. 5A). While the transcripts of all other I-BAR domain
genes were nearly undetectable, MIM transcripts were readily identified in primary B cells
but much less prominent in monocytes, T cells and granulocytes. Compared to T cells, the
level of MIM expression in B cells was about 16-fold higher, a result that agrees with the
study with mouse samples (Fig. 3A), suggesting that MIM in B cells has a unique function.
Next, we analyzed 11 human B acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) cases and detected the
majority (73%) of the samples contained low levels of MIM expression (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, there were negligible amounts of MIM transcripts in nine B-ALL cell lines
(Fig. 5B). In screening of seven human and one murine B lymphoma cell lines, we only
detected a weak level of MIM protein in SU-DHL-6 B-cells (Fig. 5C). We also failed to
detect abundant MIM protein in a B-cell lymphoma from a patient (Fig. S6, lane a). Thus,
low or absent MIM expression is common in these B-cell malignancies.

The mammalian MIM gene encodes a protein product containing an N-terminal region of
250 amino acids that is structurally similar to that of IRSp53 and distantly related to BinAmphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain, a motif that is present in a series of membrane modeling
proteins (Frost et al 2009, Gallop and McMahon 2005). Because the BAR domains of MIM
and IRSp53 have a unique zeppelin-like structure with the membrane binding surface on the
convex face (Lee et al 2007, Millard et al 2005, Scita et al 2008), they have been recently
used to define a subfamily of the BAR domain proteins as inverse BAR (I-BAR) domain
family, including MIM, Abba, IRSp53, IRTKS and FLJ22582. In vitro studies have
documented the role of MIM in membrane curvature, which is broadly related to cell
migration, endocytosis and cell-substratum interactions (Bompard et al 2005, Lin et al 2005,
Mattila et al 2007, Woodings et al 2003). Recent studies with other MIM knockout murine
strains also indicated a role of MIM in the intercellular interaction in the kidney cells
(Saarikangas et al 2011, Xia et al 2010). Yet, the role of MIM in the modulation of cell
migration appears to be complex. We had previously shown that overexpression of a MIM
construct inhibited cell migration in response to extracellular stimuli (Lin et al 2005).
Similarly, suppression of MIM by RNA interference increased the locomotion of breast
cancer cells in vitro (Parr and Jiang 2009). On the other hand, a Drosophila mutant with
depletion of dMIM expression exhibited a defect in a directional motility of border cells
(Quinones and Oro 2010), suggesting that MIM acts differently under physiological
conditions. Consistent with this finding, we also observed here a defect in the motility
response of MIM(−/−) B-cells to CXCL13, the signaling of which is required for B cells to
home to lymphoid follicles in the spleen and Peyer patches and for lymphoid organ
development (Lipp and Muller 2004). Inability to respond to CXCL13 may partially explain
the increased accumulation of B cells in the peripheral blood and the decrease in the spleens
of MIM knockout mice. Since MIM is an intracellular protein and regulates the actin
cytoskeleton-mediated membrane dynamics, MIM deficiency may affect signaling pathways
of other types of chemokines released from stromal cells in the bone marrow, and thereby
possibly influencing B-cell differentiation at an earlier stage such as the transition from preB2 to immature B-cells as detected herein. However, we could not rule out completely the
possibility that the targeting event in our MIM knockout mice may create these phenotypes
through a secondary and unknown mechanism.

Improper interactions of stem cells or progenitors with stromal cells have been associated
with cancers including human lymphoma (Egeblad et al 2010, Gribben 2010, Mahadevan et
al 2005) and murine lymphoma (Middendorp et al 2009). Furthermore, upregulated
chemokine signaling pathways are thought to promote tumor progression by driving
leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis and by establishing a tumor milieu favoring
metastases (Karnoub and Weinberg 2006). Yet, we show here that MIM is necessary for the
migration of B cells toward CXCL13, a primary chemokine for B cells, and increased
response to chemokines is often associated with metastases (McAllister and Weinberg
2010). It is also paradoxical to observe extensive lymphoid infiltrates in various organs with
MIM(−/−) mice. One possibility is that the MIM-mediated response to chemotactic factors
is not directly involved in the infiltration of all the leukocytes into peripheral organs and
may be limited to specific types of cells in response to specific extracellular cues. Indeed, in
one case we found that an infiltrate in the liver of a MIM(−/−) mouse was more dominated
by T cells than B cells. It is also interesting to observe MIM(−/−) embryonic fibroblasts,
which expressed modest amounts of MIM, had a normal motility in the presence of growth
factors but were only impaired under conditions with low percentages of serum (Dan Yu
2011). Thus, it appears that MIM regulates cellular motility differently depending upon
microenvironments. This plastic property could provide an advantage to stem cells or
progenitors during their transition to malignancies under a pathological condition. For
example, reduced MIM expression might impair a normal stem cell-stroma interaction and
lead to improper homing of stem cells or progenitor cells to a location which would
otherwise protect them from unwanted hazards but release chemotactic signals in which the
function of MIM is not necessary. Consequently, this mismatch between progenitor cells
and their microenvironment might increase their susceptibility to oncogenic insults and their
chances to become cancer initiating cells after accumulation of mutational hits. MIM
depletion may affect other signaling pathways implicated in lymphomagenesis. Notably,
MIM is implicated in the signaling of Sonic hedgehog, which has been found to play a
critical role in the interaction between lymphoma and their immune microenvironment
(Dierks et al 2007, Lindemann 2008). Although the exact role of MIM in hedgehog
pathways in vivo remains undefined (Liu et al 2011, Saarikangas et al 2011), MIM may act
in negative concert with hedgehog proteins in B cells, and MIM depletion may facilitate the
response of neoplastic B cells to hedgehogs. In the preparation of this manuscript, Liu has
reported that frog MIM protein is associated with Daam1 (Liu et al 2011), a formin family
protein that is implicated in the actin polymerization and acts as a signaling factor
downstream of Wnt5a. Interestingly, mice with depletion of Wnt5a were also prone to
lymphomagenesis (Liang et al 2003), suggesting of an alternative link from MIM depletion
to lymphoma progression.

Maryland Baltimore. All the animal experiments were conducted in compliance with
protocols instituted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine.
Histological analysis
Mice were euthanized at the ages of 14–28 months and examined at necropsy for the
presence of tumors. Tumors and tissue organs including spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, lung,
liver, femur, kidney, brain, pancreas, intestine, colon, and heart were dissected, fixed and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) as described previously (Wang et al 2007).
Sections were examined microscopically and the presence of lymphoma was identified
according to the Bethesda classification (Morse et al 2002). To determine the B-cell origin
of the lymphomas, sections containing lymphomas were immunostained with anti-CD20,
B220 and CD3 antibodies, respectively, as described previously (Wang et al 2007).
Western blot

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Splenic B-cells were purified according to the procedure as described previously (Su et al
2008). Briefly, spleens were dissected from animals and minced. The resulting non-adherent
cells were collected in B-cell medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine and 50 μM β-mecaptoethanol), and were incubated with anti T-cell
mixture (anti-Thy1, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8) for 30 min followed by treatment with Low
Tox complement (Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, NC) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Purified B cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and subject to 8% SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting using anti-MIM polyclonal antibody (Wang et al 2007). Equal
protein loading on gels was confirmed by anti-actin antibody. To isolate human B cells,
mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood and incubated with magnetic beads
coated with CD19 monoclonal antibody for 3min at 4°C. The magnetic beads were
collected, and washed with PBS and further incubated in RPMI1640 medium at 37°C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2. The magnetic beads were separated from CD19+ B cells by using
Dynal MPC device (Dynal Biotech).
A human lymphoma specimen was obtained as a lymph node biopsy from a patient with Bcell lymphoma with informed consent under an IRB approved human subject research
protocol.
Flow cytometry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells isolated from bone marrow or spleen were incubated with appropriate surface marker
antibodies for 40 min at 4°C, washed once with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and analyzed on
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with Flowjo software.
Cell motility assay
B-cell migration was analyzed using Costar Transwell plates with 5-μm pore size (Corning,
Lowell, MA). Briefly, 106 B-cells suspended in 100 μL of B-cell medium were loaded into
the upper chamber of a Transwell plate. The lower chamber was loaded with 600 μL of the
same medium containing 1 μg/mL CXCL13. In a different experiment, a range of CXCL13
concentrations from 0 to 1 μg/mL was used. The control sample was set up with the lower
chamber containing the medium alone. The plate was incubated at 37°C with constant 5%
CO2 supply. After 2 h of incubation, the upper chambers were removed and the cells that
had migrated into the lower chamber were counted with hematocytometer. The percentage
of migrated cells was calculated by dividing the number of cells collected in the lower
chamber by the total cell number loaded into the plate at the initial set up.

Fig. 1. Phenotypes of MIM KO mice

(A) MIM(−/−) mice have a shorter life span as compared to MIM(+/−) and MIM(+/+) mice
as observed within 24 months. The p value (t test) refers to the difference between MIM(−/
−) and MIM(+/+) mice. (B) Comparison of the spleens from a two-month old MIM(−/−)
mouse and a MIM(+/+) mouse at the same age based on the weight (right, n=12) and the
size (right). (C) Comparison of the whole body weight of MIM(−/−) and MIM(+/+) mice at
1 and 2 month old (n=6), respectively.

Fig. 4. MIM KO mice were partially impaired in B-cell development and the motility response to
CXCL13

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) The bone marrow of MIM KO mice contained an increased population of pre-B2 cells
but a decreased population of immature B cells. (B) MIM KO mice developed significantly
less sIgM+ B cells in both spleen and bone marrow. (C) MIM KO mice developed less sIgD
+ B-cells in the spleen. (D) Splenic MIM KO B cells were unable to migrate efficiently into
Transwell chambers containing 1 μg/mL CXCL13. (E) Motility of B cells was measured at
difference doses of CXCL13. (F) MIM heterozygous B cells displayed a normal response to
CXCL13. All the data represent three independent experiments (mean ± SEM).
