Mechanisms of Resistance to Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor Blockade
Shaad E. Abdullah, MD1 and Roman Perez-Soler, MD2

Angiogenesis is essential for the growth of primary tumors and for their metastasis. This process is induced by factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), that bind to transmembrane VEGF receptors (VEGFRs).
VEGF-A is the primary factor involved with angiogenesis; it binds to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The inhibition of
angiogenesis by obstructing VEGF-A signaling has been investigated as a method to treat solid tumors, but the development of resistance to this blockade has complicated treatment. The major mechanisms of this resistance to
VEGF-A blockade include signaling by redundant receptors, such as the fibroblast growth factors, angiopoietin-1,
ephrins, and other forms of VEGF. Other major mechanisms of resistance are increased metastasis of hypoxia-resistant tumor cells, recruitment of cell types capable of promoting VEGF-independent angiogenesis, and increased circulation of nontumor proangiogenic factors. Additional mechanisms of resistance to VEGF-A blockade include
heterogeneity of responsiveness among tumor cells, use of anti-VEGF-A agents at insufficient doses or for insufficient
duration, altered sensitivity to anti-VEGF-A agents by mutations in endothelial cells or vascular remodeling, maintenance of vascular sleeves that allow for easy regrowth of tumor vasculature upon discontinuation of therapy, vascular
cooption, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. An understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the development of
targeted therapies that overcome this resistance. Some of these approaches include the combined inhibition of
redundant angiogenic pathways, proper patient selection for various therapies based on gene expression profiles,
blockade of cellular migration by inhibition of colony-stimulating factor, or the use of agents to disrupt vascular archiC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION

Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are the essential processes that form the extensive human vasculature, providing oxygen, essential nutrients, and transport of cells and cellular products.1 Vasculogenesis2 occurs in the embryo when
endothelial cells arising from the mesoderm form vascular channels. The vascular architecture of the mature organism
then forms by the process defined as angiogenesis through extensive branching, sprouting,3 and intussusceptive microvascular growth,4 followed by association with the vascular smooth muscle.5 Angiogenesis occurs throughout the lifetime of
the individual and takes part in tissue repair, hemostasis, the menstrual cycle, implantation of the embryo, and overall
growth and maturation.6 The pathogenesis of many diseases occurs by dysfunction in the formation of vessels (eg, preeclampsia),7 inappropriate vessel overgrowth (eg, diabetic retinopathy),8 insufficiency or occlusion of vessels (coronary
and cerebrovascular disease), and neovascularization (tumorigenesis).9,10
Angiogenesis is controlled by various growth, inhibitory, and feedback mechanisms that are tightly regulated.11 Stasis in angiogenesis12 can be achieved either by removing or interrupting positive growth factors13 or by administration of
negative factors.14 Because the growth and progression of solid tumors depends on angiogenesis, inhibition of this process
has been investigated as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.15-18 Here, we discuss how the use of inhibitors
of angiogenesis have compound effects along with conventional chemotherapy in malignancy and metastasis.15-17 Several

antiangiogenic agents have been developed for the treatment of various cancers (Table 1); however, tumor growth
still occurs over time, and this problem of resistance is the
focus of our review.
Factors of Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis occurs under the influence of various biochemical interactions and also possibly by mechanical
stimulation like shear stress of exercise.23 Once the need
for a new vessel is established, proangiogenic factors result
in proliferation and infiltration of endothelial cells
through degradation of the extracellular matrix by myeloid24 and various circulating inflammatory cells. Finally,
smooth muscle migration from pericytes leads to vascular
wall maturation and the formation of a new vessel.3

3456

Endothelial cell proliferation is induced by soluble
factors like vascular endothelial growth factors
(VEGFs),25,26 fibroblast growth factors (FGFs),27,28
angiopoietin-1,29 and insulin-like growth factors
(IGFs),30 as well as the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).31 These factors interact with cognate cell surface receptors and various coreceptors like
syndecans32 to promote proliferation. In addition,
enzymes like matrix metalloproteinase digest extracellular
matrix, and endothelial cells interact with various integrins to cause migration and apoptosis,33 making way for
the new vessel. Finally, antiangiogenic factors (eg, endostatin) secreted by tumor cells also affect the development
of tumor vasculature and may be therapeutically induced
as a potential strategy to inhibit angiogenesis.9,34 All these

processes occur simultaneously with each process playing
its essential and crucial part to ensure functional vessel formation and stabilization.
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
Receptors
The VEGFs are a family of proteins that play a dominant
role in angiogenesis. Five of these factors are produced in
humans and were named in the order of their discovery:
placental growth factor 1 (PlGF-1) and PlGF-2, VEGFA, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D.35 Orf virus (Poxviridae)-encoded VEGF-E, and, more recently, VEGF-F
identified in snake venom36 complete the total of 7 proteins discovered thus far with ability to interact with
VEGF receptors (VEGFRs).
VEGF-A is a major factor involved in angiogenesis;
after coupling with its appropriate receptor, it causes
migration and multiplication of endothelial cells. VEGFA also increases expression of proangiogenic integrins
(avb3), increases vessel permeability, causes vasodilation,
and is chemotactic to macrophages and granulocytes. In
addition, VEGF-A increases expression of enzymes responsible for extracellular matrix degradation, resulting in
creation of the blood vessel lumen. The combination of
all the above processes leads to infiltration and formation
of the vessel into the supporting tissue.37,38
Conflicting evidence has been reported from preclinical models regarding the role of VEGF-B in angiogenesis and cardiovascular development.37-39 VEGF-C
and VEGF-D are mostly involved with lymphangiogenesis,37 whereas PlGF, similar to VEGF-A, plays an important role in normal and tumor-associated angiogenesis.37
Provided there is no interference in the signaling of these
proangiogenic factors, all these processes may occur normally throughout life.
These proteins are products of an 8-exon VEGF
gene through which alternate splicing can alter expression,
biologic activity, and heparin-binding affinity. Such differences in splicing can also make them behave as either
proangiogenic or antiangiogenic.40 The presence of these
various isoforms also may predict response and toxicity to
various antiangiogenic agents in development.41
The VEGFRs,42 namely VEGFR-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase [FLT]-1), VEGFR-2 (fetal liver kinase [FLK]
1/kinase insert domain receptor [KDR]), and VEGFR-3
(FLT-4), consist of a split intercellular tyrosine kinase domain, a single transmembrane component, and 7 immunoglobulin-like domains that form the extracellular
component. Different binding affinities exist among

Cancer

July 15, 2012

VEGFRs and VEGF family members; specifically, VEGF
binds to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2; whereas VEGFB, PlGF-1, and PlGF-2 primarily activate VEGFR-1.
VEGF-C and VEGF-D have highest affinity for VEGFR3, VEGF-E primarily binds VEGFR-2, and VEGF-F may
interact with both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.35,38 Differences also exist in the level of involvement of each receptor
in specific processes. For example, VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2 are involved primarily in vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis, whereas VEGFR-3 mostly takes part in lymphangiogenesis.35 VEGFR-2 mediates most of the known
responses of VEGF; however, VEGFR-1 may modulate
the function of VEGFR-2. The neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 receptors form complexes with VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2, enhance VEGFR-mediated VEGF signaling,
and may transmit VEGF signaling even in the absence of
VEGFRs through interactions with other types of tyrosine
kinases (Fig. 1).43 Tumor cells are known to over express
VEGF and at times may express multiple VEGF ligands
simultaneously, whereas endothelial cells represent the
most significant source of VEGFR expression. Specifically, VEGFR-2 is globally expressed by endothelial cells,
whereas VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 expression is restricted
to endothelial cells in distinct locations.35
Inhibition of Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is an essential process for the growth of primary tumors and their metastasis. The critical process of
blood vessel recruitment18 may occur even at a premalignant stage to promote proliferation.44 Inhibition of angiogenesis at such an early stage can be valuable to prevent
the initial growth of the primary tumor and the occurrence and growth of metastases, potentially making conventional chemotherapy agents more effective.45-47
Stasis in angiogenesis can be achieved either by
blocking or inhibiting proangiogenic factors or by administering compounds that, by themselves, have endogenous
antiangiogenic properties. Endogenous compounds with
antiangiogenic properties include vasostatin, angiostatin,
endostatin, and platelet factor-4, among others. Many
drugs, such as anti-VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab
[Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif]) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; eg, sunitinib [Pfizer; New London,
Conn], sorafenib [Bayer; Leverkusen, Germany], pazopanib [GlaxoSmithKline; London, United Kingdom]), have
been developed to date for the treatment of various cancers (Table 1). Some of these agents have been incorporated into various existing chemotherapy regimens,
whereas others are used as single agents.

molecules (including variants of VEGF-A and the semaphorins) form complexes with VEGFRs and potentiate VEGF signaling.

Mechanisms of Resistance to Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor
Blockade
VEGF-targeted monoclonal antibodies (eg, bevacizumab)
and receptor-targeted monoclonal antibodies inhibit receptor-ligand interaction and the subsequent activation of
receptors through binding ligand or binding the extracellular domain of the receptor, respectively; whereas TKIs
bind the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor to block activation of downstream signaling.48 In
addition to currently approved indications, sorafenib,
sunitinib, and pazopanib (all of which are multitargeted
antiangiogenic TKIs) are in later stages of clinical development for the treatment of other cancer types. Other investigational TKIs (cediranib [AstraZeneca; Wilmington,
Del], BIBF 1120 [Boehringer Ingelheim; Ingelheim, Germany], brivanib [Bristol-Myers Squibb; New York, NY],
motesanib [Amgen; Thousand Oaks, Calif], ABT-869
[Abbott; Abbott Park, Il], and axitinib [Pfizer]) also are
being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment
of a number of malignancies (Table 2).
Inhibition of the VEGF pathway as an approach to
antiangiogenic therapy is well established; however, not
all patients respond to anti-VEGF therapy, and patients

3458

that do respond eventually may experience progressive
disease.58 Because proangiogenic VEGF signaling seems
highly integrated with other pathways, such as plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)59,60 and FGF signaling,61,62 it is believed that targeting additional angiogenic
and/or proliferative compensatory pathways could prevent or overcome resistance. Synergistic angiogenic effects
have been described among these signaling pathways and
VEGF, and both PDGF and FGF signaling have been
associated with resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy.63-67
Clinically, resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy may
be defined as the evidence of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors despite therapy.68 However, it is recognized that resistance
to VEGF-targeted and other targeted therapies may fall
within a span of outcomes and is not identical68,69; these
outcomes may include intrinsic nonresponsiveness (failure to achieve any tumor shrinkage) with more rapid progression, minor antitumor effects followed by
progression, or prolonged tumor shrinkage that may be
followed by a slower progressive disease. Patients who experience the latter outcome may present with progressive
disease with a lower total tumor burden than before therapy.69 Malignancies can develop various patterns to

Major Mechanisms

resent another alternate pathway by which tumors can
resist therapy.74 Such pathways can result in an escape
mechanism from proangiogenic blockade and result in
alternate signaling toward the direction of least resistance
from currently available agents (Fig. 2).

Redundant signaling of receptors

Human cells possess various alternate pathways to
overcome aberrations in normal signaling. These same
pathways may offer resistance to currently available antiVEGF drugs. It has been demonstrated that treatment
with anti-VEGF drugs in pancreatic tumors up-regulates
FGF-1 and FGF-2, angiopoietin-1, ephrin-A1, and ephrin-A2.63 Increased levels of FGF-2, stromal cell-derived
factor 1 (SDF-1), and circulating endothelial cells (CECs)
are observed upon disease progression during VEGFR
blockade in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.72
Overlapping VEGFR specificity, such as the overlap of
VEGF-C and VEGF-D, can take over signaling in the
event of VEGF-A blockade.73 Up-regulation of PDGF-C
in tumor-associated fibroblasts can be observed in tumors
that are refractory to anti-VEGF therapy and, hence, rep-

Selection of hypoxia-resistant malignant clones

Under anti-VEGF therapy, particular clones can be
selected that have the ability to survive antiangiogenic
therapy-induced hypoxia and potentially metastasize (Fig.
3). Increased invasiveness and metastasis have been
observed in pancreatic islet cell tumors and glioblastomas
in mice upon VEGFR and PDGFR blockade.75 Similarly,
in breast cancer and malignant melanoma, antiangiogenic
therapy inhibits primary tumor growth but facilitates metastasis.76 Although hypoxia is induced by anti-VEGF
therapy, the selection of hypoxia-resistant clones (through
loss of p53) also has been observed with VEGFR-2 inhibition.77 These clones require fewer proangiogenic factors
to promote their growth and proliferation and, thus, are
indirectly resistant to current therapy. Because therapy

Figure 3. Increased metastasis/invasiveness during vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade is illustrated. Anti-VEGF
therapy can lead to the inhibition of primary tumor growth, but an increase in metastasis may occur because of the selection of
resistant tumor cells. These resistant clones migrate away from the primary tumor into surrounding tissue and organs during
anti-VEGF therapy.

with selective anti-VEGF agents only blocks 1 factor,
other proangiogenic factors still can override the blockade
and use alternate pathways to favor angiogenesis and
extracellular matrix degradation for possible increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Thus, hypoxia, which
leads to increased VEGF signaling/angiogenesis, may continue to be a driving force for angiogenesis (after transient
hypoxia is induced by initial anti-VEGF therapy) through
the selection of hypoxia-resistant clones.
Myeloid and circulating cell recruitment for
vascular endothelial growth factor-independent
angiogenesis

Bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial precursors (CEPs), CECs, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial TEK tyrosine kinase 2
(Tie 2)-expressing monocytes, fibroblasts, and neutrophils can be recruited to intratumor areas of hypoxia to
override anti-VEGF therapy.72,78-80 Such circulating
cells, like the tumor-associated protein gamma response
1-positive and cluster of differentiation molecule 11B
(integrin alpha M) (CD11bþ/Gr1þ) myeloid cells, can
result in resistance to anti-VEGF therapy by contributing
to angiogenesis aided by endogenous granulocyte-colony–
stimulating factor (G-CSF)81 and possibly by exogenous

administration of G-CSF after various chemotherapy regimens or other various causes of neutropenia (Fig. 4).
Increase in circulating nontumor proangiogenic
factors

Dose-dependent increases in circulating proangiogenic nontumor secreted factor levels results in tumor
angiogenesis by a resultant increase in alternate signaling.82 Systemic increases in nontumor proangiogenic factors like VEGF, G-CSF, SDF-1, osteopontin, and stem
cell factor have been observed after administration of systemic VEGFR/PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors because
of inhibition of normal pathways. An increase in expression of these factors possibly may fuel alternate signaling
pathways for angiogenesis, overwhelm anti-VEGF therapy targets, and cause resistance or may require dynamic
adjustment in dosage of therapy. PlGF, FGF-B, or basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) observed in colon cancer recurrence83 can
signal a systemic compensatory mechanism, which would
warrant using inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinase,
bFGF, or mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
(MET). Hypothetically, these similar mechanisms also
could fuel progression of secondary metastatic disease
(Fig. 5).

When the VEGF pathway is blocked, other cell types facilitate resistance and continued angiogenesis. These include bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial precursors (CEPs), circulating endothelial cells (CECs), pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated

Other postulated mechanisms
Heterogeneous angiogenic factor requirement of
tumor cells.

The heterogeneity of various tumor types also can
make them inherently less or more responsive to various
antiangiogenic factors. Anti-VEGF therapy in neuroblastoma appears to be less effective than in Wilms tumor xenografts in preclinical studies.84 Similar heterogeneity has
been reported within renal cell carcinoma, in which some
tumors do not respond to anti-VEGF therapy, whereas
other subsets will have an impressive response of stable
disease for up to 3 to 5 years.85-87
Inadequate duration or dosage of therapy.

Some metastases are so small before the initiation of VEGF blockade that they can rely on diffusion from surrounding tissue for their nutritional
requirements. Such micrometastases, which can survive
without neovascularization, can persist beyond the

3462

currently recommended duration of anti-VEGF therapy and progress after tumor dormancy.88 For patients
with advanced renal cell carcinoma, a higher dose of
anti-VEGF therapy was required in clinical trials than
that previously calculated as optimal from preclinical
studies. On the basis of these results, calculating the
adequate dose of such agents to provide optimal inhibition of VEGF signaling may pose a problem.85
Endothelial cell mutations.

On initial development of antiangiogenic drugs, it
was believed that the endothelial cells forming the tumor
vasculature were not prone to the same increased mutation rate as that of the malignancy itself, but it has been
demonstrated recently that tumor endothelial cells are
cytogenetically abnormal and can have tumor-related
mutations.89-91 Such mutations potentially can lead to
conformational changes in receptors and the proangiogenic factor requirement of tumor-associated vessels.

blockade and allow signaling through alternate angiogenic pathways.

Changes also may affect the expression profile and the resultant sensitivity to available antiangiogenic agents.

metastasis after anti-VEGF therapy has indicated that such
tumor vessels have enhanced vessel diameter, mature pericytes, immunoreactivity for desmin, PDGFR-b, and latestage maturity marker a smooth muscle actin indicating
increased vessel maturity, all of which may be because of
anti-VEGF therapy.92 Vascular remodeling by PDGF-B
and ephrin-B2 up-regulation causes increased pericyte coverage, hence decreasing the amount of VEGF required for
malignant angiogenesis.93,94 Such enhanced vessel architecture forms a complicated barrier to current therapy, which

Although endothelial cells may die from anti-VEGF
therapy, empty vascular sleeves persist within the tumor
that can serve as channels for endothelial cell proliferation
when anti-VEGF therapy is halted.95 These channels are
formed by the persistence of pericytes and vascular basement membrane forming a scaffold for endothelial cell
regrowth. Endothelial cell proliferation then rapidly
occurs through this scaffold, suggesting either that maintenance antiangiogenic therapy or drugs consistent with
the destruction of these supporting structures may be necessary to overcome resistance and inhibit growth.

Figure 6. This is an overview of the mechanisms of resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade. Resistance
to VEGF blockade may occur through a variety of mechanisms, including alternative signaling pathways, increased metastasis
and invasion caused by the selection of resistant tumor cells, proangiogenic circulating and supporting cells, and increased circulating proangiogenic factors.

cells grow around pre-existing normal vessels and draw
their oxygen and other essential nutrients without the
need for new vasculogenesis.96 This process has been
reported previously in lung cancer cells97 and glioblastomas98,99 under anti-VEGF therapy.
Intussusceptive angiogenesis.

In the absence of VEGF stimulation, blood vessels
can split into new vessels without the need for endothelial
proliferation.100 Intussusceptive angiogenesis is a relatively fast process in which existing endothelial cells
migrate and are remodeled by increasing in volume and
becoming thinner. Because existing endothelial cells are
assimilated, the requirement for VEGF-mediated endothelial proliferation can be overcome by the tumor. It is
believed that the factors that influence this process are
blood flow dynamics and shear stress and that such dynamics result in endothelial-endothelial and endothelialpericyte interactions, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and adaptation of gap junction complexes. It is also hypothesized
that inhibition of sprouting angiogenesis may even stimulate intussusceptive angiogenesis.
Future Prospects
Although many pathways of resistance to anti-VEGF
therapy have been identified to date (Fig. 6), all of this information adds to our understanding of this critical process of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis. By
the combined inhibition of various redundant proangiogenic factors and their pathways, these mechanisms of

3464

resistance potentially may be overcome. Such a response
has been noticed in concurrent inhibition of HIF-1 and
VEGF,101 antibody-directed blockade of PlGF,102 antibody-directed blockade of integrin avb3,103 and antiinterleukin-6 therapy in gliomas104 and other examples.
In addition, several multitargeted antiangiogenic TKIs
currently are approved (Table 1) and/or in phase 3 of clinical development (Table 2) for the treatment of various
cancer types.
Because the VEGF gene is highly polymorphic, discovery and further elaboration of isoforms of VEGF-A or
other proangiogenic factors may result in the ability to
select subgroups that would benefit from existing antiVEGF therapy. Depending on their gene expression profile, such subgroups may have relatively worse or better inherent disease outcomes. The identification of certain
subgroups also may help us to identify the candidates for
antiangiogenic therapy who are most likely to experience
benefits in overall survival or to select for patients who are
at higher risk of drug-induced toxicity41 for which tailored, pre-emptive strategies can be undertaken.
Blocking the migration of myeloid cells, CECs, and
inflammatory cells by the inhibition of colony-stimulating factors105,106 also appears to be a new promising front
for antiangiogenic therapy. This hypothesis can be applied
in combination with chemotherapy and also should be
taken into consideration with liberal administration of
parenteral G-CSF to avoid any of its possible proangiogenic effects.
Vascular architecture disruption also can be influential in tumor antiangiogenesis and prevention of metastasis. Endothelial-specific pathways like delta-like 4 (Dll-4)-

mediated notch signaling attenuation, can cause excessive
branching and sprouting. Such excessive disruption can
result in functionally defective, chaotic vessel architecture,
leading to growth inhibition.107
By using information thus gained from studies of
the above-mentioned mechanisms of resistance, targeted
therapy to potentially overcome resistance and possibly
assist conventional chemotherapy agents can be developed. Such agents can be used as single agents, in combination with currently available chemotherapy agents, or
in new metronomic regimens that use each drug at its
most critical step, thus inhibiting both tumor growth and
metastasis.
