Abstract
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor
erlotinib is approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer but
the overall activity is minimal, and known predictive factors
for EGFR inhibitor efficacy are infrequent in this disease. We
tested the hypothesis that global activation of the EGFR
pathway is predictive of EGFR inhibitor efficacy. Pancreatic
cancer tumors directly xenografted at surgery were treated
with the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and cetuximab and
analyzed for biological features. Two of 10 tumors were
sensitive, and by global gene expression profiling with gene
set enrichment analysis, the EGFR pathway was highly
expressed in sensitive compared with resistant tumors. The
core gene components driving EGFR pathway overexpression
were pathway ligands and positive effectors. In a prospective
validation, the EGFR pathway-based signature correctly
predicted anti-EGFR treatment response in eight additional
tumors and was not predictive of response to gemcitabine and
CI1040 (a MEK inhibitor). Analysis of EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA
mutations and gene amplification by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed that none of these genetic abnormalities were
neither predictive nor responsible for the EGFR pathway
activation. Coordinated overexpression of the EGFR pathway
predicts susceptibility to EGFR inhibitors in pancreatic cancer.
These results suggest a phenomenon of pathway addiction and
support the value of unbiased system biology approaches in
drug development. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2841–9]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib
is approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer, but the overall
therapeutic efficacy is minimal (1). There is an unmet need to
identify the individual factors predicting such susceptibility. Cancer
is a genetic disease (2), and accumulating data suggest that the
factors determining the sensitivity to anticancer agents also have a
genetic basis. The presence of acquired mutations in the catalytic

domain of the EGFR gene increase sensitivity to anti-EGFR
small-molecule inhibitors in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
refs. 3, 4). Likewise, increased EGFR and HER2 gene copy number
detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was
associated with improved gefitinib efficacy in patients with NSCLC
(5, 6). In addition, there is evidence that KRAS mutations confer
resistance to EGFR inhibition (7).
As the EGFR is a validated target in pancreatic cancer but with
limited clinical activity, the identification of factors predicting
drug response is a relevant question. However, several series
investigating known predictive factors for EGFR inhibition, such as
EGFR mutations or amplifications in pancreatic cancer, have failed
to document a meaningful prevalence of such alterations (8, 9),
and HER2 amplification assessment has rendered conflicting results
(10, 11). These observations highlight the need to explore alternative
explanations for pancreatic cancer aberrant EGFR pathway
activation (12).
Because of existing data on other tumor types, the hypothesis
driving our work was that vulnerability to EGFR-targeting agents is
related to dependence on the EGFR pathway. The above negative
data led us to propose that factors, other than single oncogene
alterations, may be relevant in determining anti-EGFR effect. The
level of complexity of common cancers may be higher than
expected (13), and probably more sophisticated, integrative
approaches to gather information are needed to meaningfully
interrogate a tumor. Gene expression analysis has shown promise
to characterize cancer (14), and recently, a diagnostic tool
(MammaPrint) derived from global unbiased testing received
regulatory approval for risk prognostication for breast cancer
(15). From a biological perspective, it evaluates what is considered
the dynamic language controlling cell processes, both normal and
altered. Several computational methods have improved the ability
to identify candidate genes that are correlated with a phenotype by
exploiting the idea that gene expression alterations might be
revealed at the level of biological pathways or coregulated gene
sets, rather than at the level of individual genes (16–18).
We tested if the sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in pancreatic
cancer would be dependent on EGFR pathway alterations
and whether those would predominantly be at the gene expression
level. To test our hypothesis, we first targeted the EGFR with
a small molecule inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity (erlotinib), a
monoclonal antibody targeting the extracelular domain (cetuximab), and the combination of both in a learning set of freshly
generated human pancreatic cancer xenografts (19). Then we
explored gene expression–based approaches in those tumors,

generated a predicitive signature, and prospectively queried a
second cohort (validation set). The accuracy of these predictions
was prospectively tested by treating those cases with erlotinib.
Finally, genetic factors known to be relevant in other tumor types
were explored to understand the gene expression findings, and
protein expression/activation were assessed to determine the effect
of differential gene expression in EGFR pathway components.

Materials and Methods
Drugs. Erlotinib (OSI Pharmaceuticals) and cetuximab (Imclone
Systems) were obtained from commercially available sources.
In vivo growth inhibition studies. Six-week-old female athymic nude
mice (Harlan) were used. The research protocol was approved by the Johns
Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals were
maintained in accordance to guidelines of the American Association of
Laboratory Animal Care. The xenografts were generated according to
methodology published elsewhere (19). Briefly, surgical nondiagnostic
specimens of patients operated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were
reimplanted s.c. to one to two mice for each patient, with two small pieces
per mouse (this is the first passage of the human tumor on the mouse;
thus, it constitutes the F1 generation). Tumors were let to grow to a size of
1.5 cm3, at which point they were harvested, divided, and transplanted to
another five mice (F2 generation). After a second growth, passage tumors
were excised and propagated to cohorts of 20 mice or more, which
constituted the treatment cohort (F3 generation). Tumors from this
treatment cohort were allowed to grow until reaching f200 mm3, at
which time mice were randomized in the following three treatment groups,
with five to six mice (10 evaluable tumors) in each group: (a) control, (b)
erlotinib 50 mg/kg/d i.p., (c) cetuximab 40 mg/kg twice a week i.p., and (d)
erlotinib plus cetuximab at the above doses. Treatment was given for 28 d.
Gemcitabine and CI1040 were given in prior experiments twice weekly for
4 wk at 100 mg/kg i.p. and twice daily for 28 d at 150 mg/kg i.p., respectively.
Mice were monitored daily for signs of toxicity and were weighed thrice per
week. Tumor size was evaluated twice per week by caliper measurements
using the following formula: tumor volume = (length  width2) / 2. Relative
tumor growth inhibition was calculated by relative tumor growth of treated
mice divided by relative tumor growth of control mice since the initiation of
therapy [treated versus control (T/C) ratio]. Tumors with a T/C of <20%
were considered sensitive.
Microarray gene expression. Baseline, untreated tumors were profiled
using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene arrays in duplicate. Sample preparation
and processing procedure were performed as described in the Affymetrix
GeneChip Expression Analysis Manual (Affymetrix, Inc.). The gene
expression data have been deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)6 and are
accessible through GEO series accession number GSE9599.
Gene set enrichment analysis. Gene expression levels were converted
to a rank-based matrix and standardized (mean, 0; SD, 1) for each
microarray. Gene set analysis was performed using the gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) software (18) version 2.0.1 obtained from Broad Institute.7
Genes represented by more than one probe were collapsed using the
Collapse Probes utility to the probe with the maximum value. The gene sets
database was compiled from the KEGG database (May 29, 2007 version;
ref. 20). The KEGG gene sets database contains 197 human pathways that
include metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and human diseases. One hundred
sixty-five gene sets passed the gene set size filter criteria (min, 10; max, 500).
P values for the gene sets were computed by permuting the genes 1,000
times in this study.
Core gene expression classifier. The core gene expression classifier was
built by the logistic regression model using LogitBoost implemented in the

WEKA machine learning package version 3.4 (21). The default variables
were used in this study.
DNA mutation analysis. Mutations of the KRAS oncogene were
determined as previously described (22). PCR amplifications of exons 18,
19, and 21 of EGFR; exon 11 of BRAF; and exons 9, 10, and 20 of PI3KCA
were performed as described (3, 23, 24). The primers used are available
upon request. Sequencing in the forward and reverse direction was
performed using an ABI 3730XL Sequencer in the Genetics Resource Core
Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
FISH assessment. Paraffin-embedded sections were submitted to dualcolor FISH assays using the EGFR SO/CEP7 SG probe set and PathVysion
DNA kit (HER2 SO/CEP17 SG; Vysis/Abbott Laboratories). Initially,
the slides were incubated for 2 h at 60jC, deparaffinized in Citro-Solv
(Fisher) and washed in 100% ethanol for 5 min. The slides were incubated in
2  SSC at 75jC for 10 to 18 min and digested in 0.25 mg/mL proteinase
K/2  SSC at 45jC for 11 to 18 min. Then, the slides were washed in
2  SSC for 5 min and dehydrated in ethanol. Probes were applied
according to the manufacturer’s instructions to the selected hybridization
areas. DNA denaturation was performed for 15 min at 80jC, and the slides
were incubated at 37jC for 20 h. Posthybridization washes were performed
with 1.5 urea/0.1  SSC at 45jC for 35 min. Then, the slides were washed in
2  SSC for 2 min and dehydrated in ethanol. Chromatin was counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.3 Ag/mL in Vectashield;
Vector Laboratories). Analysis was performed on epifluorescence microscope using single interference filter sets for green (FITC), red (Texas red),
and blue (DAPI), as well as dual (red/green) and triple (blue, red, green)
band pass filters, and was done in the areas correspondent to the areas
previously microdissected.
According to the frequency of cells with specific number of copies of the
EGFR gene and chromosome 7 centromere, the areas were classified into six
FISH categories with ascending number of copies of the EGFR gene per cell
[(a) disomy (V2 copies in >90% of cells), (b) low trisomy (V2 copies in z40%
of cells, 3 copies in 10–40% of cells, z4 copies in <10% of cells), (c) high
trisomy (V2 copies in z40% of cells, 3 copies in z40% of cells, z4 copies in
<10% of cells), (d) low polysomy (z4 copies in 10–40% of cells), (e) high
polysomy (z4 copies in z40% of cells), and ( f ) gene amplification], defined
by the presence of tight EGFR gene clusters, a ratio of gene/chromosome
per cell of z2 or z15 copies of EGFR per cell in z10% of analyzed cells.
FISH scores 1 to 4 classify the specimen as FISH negative (FISH ); scores
5 and 6 classify the specimen as FISH positive (FISH+).
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. For multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of DNA copy
number changes, a specific probe mixture with 48 subtelomeric probe sets
for all chromosomes was used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Salsa P036, MRC-Holland B.V.). In short, f100 ng of DNA in
5 AL were denaturated at 98jC for 5 min and subsequently hybridized
overnight with a mix of subtelomeric probe pairs, each consisting of two
oligonucleotides (hemiprobes) that recognize adjacent DNA sequences. On
day 2, the adjacently hybridized hemiprobes were ligated. After denaturation, PCR was performed with two universal PCR primers, amplifying all
probe pairs in one reaction. Experiments for both test and reference
samples were carried out in triplicate. Analysis of the MLPA PCR products
was performed on an ABI model 3100 16-capillary sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
Immunohistochemical analysis. Five-micron sections were used for
Ki67 staining that was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions
(DAKO) and scored as percentage staining nuclei. Phosphorylated mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK; Cell Signaling Technology) staining was
performed using citrate steam recovery, followed by catalyzed signal
amplification (DAKO).

treatment, resulting only in modest growth inhibition. Overall
erlotinib showed marginally higher potency compared with
cetuximab, with an average T/C ratio of 54% versus 65% when

therapy induced a marginal effect (253)] were blindly analyzed for
treatment effect (Supplementary Fig. S1), using phosphorylated
MAPK and Ki67 as the most suitable and reproducible end points
for immunohistochemistry assessment of anti-EGFR effect (25, 26).
Phosphorylated MAPK only changed significantly in all treatment
arms from 198, 410, and the 253 combination arm, wherein some
degree of antitumor effect was documented. Ki67 proliferation
index decreased across treatment groups in 198 and 410 but did
not change in 215 or 253.
Gene expression analysis. We approached gene expression
analysis by seeking a tool that would enable group interrogation.
To rationally explore this hypothesis in a reproducible fashion, we
used GSEA and pathway analysis, an approach that offers an
unbiased global search for genes that are coordinately regulated in
predefined pathways (in this case, as per the KEGG database;
ref. 20) rather than interrogating expression differences of single
genes. Overall, 98 gene sets were enriched in the sensitive cases, but
only eight gene sets had a nominal P value of < 0.01 (Fig. 2A). Out
of these eight gene sets, four of them have a false discovery rate
(FDR) of <0.10. One of these four was the EGFR signaling pathway
that, according to the KEGG database annotation, consists of 87
genes. Of these, the 25 genes that contributed most to the
enrichment result were defined as the core enrichment genes
(enrichment plot illustrated in Fig. 2B; list of genes in Supplementary Table S1). These include seven ligands (EGF, HB-EGF, TGFa,
BTC, EPR, NRG2, and NRG4), and pathway genes, such as MAPK810, Akt3, NRAS, PIK3CA, STAT5, and p27, were up-regulated in the
sensitive tumors. The heatmap of these core enrichment genes,
shown in Fig. 2C and D, illustrates the location of these core
enrichment genes in the EGFR signaling pathway. These results
suggest that global increase in the expression and activation of
pathway-related genes is linked to drug susceptibility.
Prospective prediction in the validation set. Thus, we
hypothesized that, by querying the EGFR pathway, we could
predict the response to EGFR inhibitors and used an independent
set of eight tumors, of which no efficacy results were known. We
tested whether the expression profiles of the core gene members in
the EGFR signaling pathway could be used as discriminative
features for prediction. We built a logistic regression classifier from
these core gene features based on these 10 cases (learning set).
Next, we collected gene expression profiles of eight independent
cases (159, 185, 219, 247, 281, 294, 354, and 420) and used the core
gene classifier to predict their drug response to EGFR inhibition.
The classifier identified 219 as sensitive and the rest to be resistant
to EGFR inhibition. To test this prediction, we conducted drug
efficacy testing on the eight tumors with erlotinib, the EGFR
inhibitor that is approved for use in pancreatic cancer patients.
The tumor 219 was sensitive (T/C, 3%), and the other seven
predictions were also accurate (global GSEA prediction m2 test,
P < 0.001), as those cases were uniformly resistant to erlotinib.
Specificity of the signature. To exclude the possibility that
these tumors were inherently sensitive/labile to any treatment,
erlotinib efficacy was correlated with the response in these cases to
gemcitabine and CI1040, a cytotoxic agent and a signal transduction inhibitor with similar level of efficacy (3 of 15), respectively.
No correlation existed between the responses to these three
treatments, indicating that each tumor’s response depends on
inherent features. The EGFR core signature is not indicative of
response to these drugs, and by GSEA, the EGFR pathway is not
differentially up-regulated in the gemcitabine or CI1040-responsive
tumors (Table 1). On the other hand, some of the EGFR-sensitive

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

tumors (198 and 247 with T/C below 10%) were sensitive to
temsirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
inhibitor (19). This is significant, as components in this pathway
were also represented in the EGFR pathway signature. However,
cases resistant to erlotinib, such as 215, were also sensitive to
temsirolimus (T/C, 16%), so the overlap between sensitivities was
again partial and not explained by the EGFR pathway overexpression.
Gene mutation, FISH, and MLPA analysis. Next, we explored
factors that have been related to EGFR sensitivity in other disease
types. EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation and amplification
profile of EGFR and HER2 by FISH were explored in these tumors
(Table 2). No mutations or deletions were found in exons 18, 19, or
21 of the EGFR or in exon 11 of BRAF. One sensitive tumor had
a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. KRAS mutations were prevalent,
but both mutated and wild-type cases were sensitive to EGFR
inhibition. EGFR gene amplification was not detected, but in seven
tumors, there was high polysomy (Fig. 3A). HER2 gene amplification was found in two specimens. There was no correlation
between the mutation or amplification profile and sensitivity to
EGFR inhibitors. Thus, these best candidates to explain differential
response to the drugs were not informative, further reinforcing the
value of the EGFR signature as the best predictor of efficacy.
We then conducted an MLPA analysis of selected genes in the
EGFR pathway to investigate whether changes in gene dosage
could explain pathway activation by using a novel, high-throughput
quantitative method (ref. 27; Fig. 3B). Sensitive tumors had copy
gains of key EGFR pathway genes, such as AKT1, NRAS, PIK3CA,
and SRC, and no change in HER4, but multiple resistant tumors
(247, 420) showed similar profiles.
Analysis of pathways activated by underlying genetic
abnormalities. To further investigate whether the presence of
the EGFR signature was related to any of the above individual
genetic factors, we determined the GSEA signatures of the
cohort of 18 tumors stratifying by each of the variables. The
strata was mutated versus nonmutated for KRAS and PIK3CA, a
score of 5 to 6 versus 1 to 4 for EGFR and HER2 FISH, and
increased copy number versus no increase in each of the eight
genes of the MLPA analysis (Supplementary Table S2). The EGFR
pathway was not present in the top scoring pathways of the
cases with neither mutations nor increased copy number/dosage
compared with the normal state tumors, indicating that none of
these individual features was causing per se the EGFR pathway
overexpression.
Immunohistochemistry assessment. Finally, to determine the
effect of EGFR pathway gene overexpression at the protein level, we
determined the baseline expression of selected elements in the
EGFR by immunohistochemistry. Sensitive cases had a globally
activated EGFR pathway profile (high EGFR, phosphorylated
MAPK, and phosphorylated Akt positivity), but resistant cases
(215, 265, 185) did stain too for these individual markers (Table 3).
So, it can be concluded that pathway activation by immunohistochemistry is necessary, but not sufficient, to confer sensitivity to
anti-EGFR therapy.

Discussion
Cancer is a complex disease characterized by multiple genetic
and molecular alterations affecting cell proliferation, survival,
differentiation, and invasion among others (28). The concept that
gene abnormalities induce the cancer phenotype and drive tumor

growth has been validated clinically by developing therapies
specifically targeting the products of those altered genes (29–31).
These have generally consisted of single-gene events, such as gene
rearrangements (32), gene copy gains (33), or activating mutations
(4). There is increasing evidence that the overexpression of groups

of genes that define a phenotype is associated to sensitivity to
specific drugs, such as in head and neck and lung cancers, where
the presence of an epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype by gene
array was predictive of sensitivity or resistance to the EGFR
inhibitor gefitinib (34). In this case, the connection between the

EGFR Pathway Addiction in Pancreatic Cancer

Figure 3. A, EGFR and HER2 FISH
of selected cases. B, MLPA analysis.
Both sensitive tumors had a very similar
distribution of dosage by MLPA with the
exception of HER2 and were the cases
with the highest similitude. Half or more of
the cases had gains of EGFR, PIK3CA ,
and Akt1. There was a poor correlation
between EGFR FISH and MLPA. Cases
with low number of HER2 copies by FISH
tended to have either no change (286, 194)
or a loss (198) by MLPA, but there was
no good correlation between HER2 by both
techniques in cases scoring 4 or more
by FISH. There was no pattern between
KRAS mutations and MLPA NRAS profile.

targeted and the overexpressed pathways was not direct. In other
cases, the presence of coordinated alterations of complex gene sets
responsible for a function has been indicative of both the relevance
of such phenotype and the potential for direct pharmacologic
intervention (35). Here, we present evidence of a similar
phenomenon in pancreatic cancer, where we find the targeted
pathway (EGFR) among those being overexpressed at the
transcription level in cases sensitive to its modulation.
Although the EGFR is a validated target in pancreatic cancer, as
shown by the fact that erlotinib has been the first agent to increase
survival when added to gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine
alone (1), the improvement is modest. As expected, in our model,
EGFR inhibitors had a significant activity only in a subset of
pancreatic cancer tumors. This sensitivity was not modalityspecific, as both monoclonal antibody–mediated receptor blockage
and tyrosine kinase activity inhibition exerted similar effect. There
seemed to be a ceiling of activity, as dual EGFR inhibition only
modestly augmented the antitumor effect, unlike in prior reports in
other models (36). This was consistent with true target dependence
and effective pathway shutdown with any intervention, as long as it
is directed against the relevant target.

Our working hypothesis was that the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors
in this disease had to be related to an alteration or increased
predominance of the targeted pathway. The reports exploring in
pancreatic cancer alterations in the EGFR pathway that are known
to determine the sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in other tumor
types have been uniformly negative; no EGFR mutations (8) and
modest low-level EGFR amplification frequencies (9) have been
communicated. Thus, we focused on gene expression and used
gene GSEA, which is a tool that helps identify growth-promoting
pathways in cancer (35). By GSEA analysis, the EGFR pathway was
among the highest expressing of the 197 pathways, on which the
55,000 transcripts are distributed. The gene classifier built using
the relevant genes in the EGFR pathway was capable of correctly
predicting the susceptibility of eight additional prospective cases
and then the whole cohort of 18 cases (3 as sensitive, 15 as
resistant; P < 0.001). Interestingly, the MAPK pathway was also
among the top scoring sets. This highlights the plausibility of the
findings as both pathways are interconnected.
EGFR pathway components are present in some of the other
differentially up-regulated sets, such as the glioma pathway. The
core gene components that drove EGFR pathway activation were

ligands and positive effectors, indicating an activating effect.
Products from some of these genes (Akt, MAPK) were shown to
have increased activation by protein analysis. Higher pathway
activation by immunohistochemistry was linked with higher
activity, but the reverse was not true, as the presence of protein
activation did not necessarily predict an antitumor effect. This
dicotomy of EGFR pathway overexpression at the mRNA and
protein levels may imply that, whereas a state of EGFR pathway
activation can exist due to transactivation of proteins by other
transducers (and thus can be considered a secondary activation),
only when this activation is the result of an increased gene
expression does it indicate a primary or driving alteration. It can be
hypothesized that in pancreatic cancer only primary activation
states, i.e., those that start at the transcription level, will be
effectively tackled by a specific anti-EGFR pharmacologic intervention. In breast cancer, initial selection strategies for trastuzumab treatment were based on protein overexpression (33), but
HER2 gene amplification has shown to be at least as good a
predictor (37), and the debate is ongoing with authors advocating
simplified algorithms where the primary genetic abnormality is
tested up-front (38). Considering that many of the components of
the EGFR signature lie downstream of other receptors, such as
HER2 testing, their inhibition in the sensitive cases (either with a
dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor or with a HER2-specific compound)
seems warranted.
We do not know the relative importance of each of the genes and
if there are intrinsic markers that could summarized the signature.
It is of interest to note that the EGFR pathway specifically
predicted the response to EGFR inhibitors, as it was not predictive
of response to gemcitabine and CI1040, a cytotoxic drug commonly
used in pancreatic cancer treatment and a signal transduction
(MEK) inhibitor. Also the correlation with an mTOR inhibitor was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

not substantial despite the presence of overlap between pathways.
The observation that a stronger pathway association existed in
targeted versus cytotoxic agents is relevant, as it supports the
notion that sensitivity to the former is related to pathway
expression patterns.
After analyzing these EGFR markers that are relevant in other
diseases, no individual feature or alteration reliably identified the
sensitive tumors to EGFR inhibition. Mutation in the KRAS gene,
an almost universal finding in pancreatic cancer, is unlikely to be a
resistant mechanism in this disease, as opposed to lung or
colorectal cancer. Otherwise, the positive outcome of the pivotal
trial is difficult to explain. In this work, two of the sensitive tumors
were in fact KRAS mutant, indicating that having a mutation in
KRAS does not necessarily preclude EGFR having a prominent role
in maintaining the tumor phenotype and growth. In fact, this
platform may be an ideal candidate to test the hypothesis that even
after KRAS inhibition EGFR signaling independent of KRAS may
drive cancer growth. This constitutes one of the future work items
once a validated KRAS inhibitor becomes available. MLPA analysis
indicated that the sensitive tumors had gains in pathway-related
genes, such as NRAS, PIK3CA, and Akt1, but this was not a specific
profile, and resistant cases presented identical patterns. We are
uncertain as to the reasons of the lack of correlation between EGFR
and HER2 FISH and MLPA results in our samples and can include
tumor heterogeneity and differences in signal/noise ratio, considering the tumor selectivity of FISH assessment. The EGFR pathway
was not present in the top scoring pathways of the cases with
neither mutations nor increased copy number/dosage, suggesting
that none of these individual genetic abnormalities was responsible
for the observed pattern. Altogether, this suggests that the
mechanistic basis for higher pathway gene expression may not
be related to a single genetic alteration.
For this work, we took advantage of the PancXenoBank, a
collection of individual pancreas cancer tumors obtained from
patients with pancreatic cancer (19). Generally, before entering
clinical trials, new agents are tested against high-passage cell lines
and typically a few xenografts established from these lines. It is
unclear how representative those models are of the biology of
pancreatic cancer, in view of the historic disconnection between
preclinical and clinical results in this disease. We have shown that
directly xenografted tumors retain the key features of the
originator tumor, represent the heterogeneity of the disease, are
easily amenable to treatment with different drugs, and offer
endless source to tumors for complex biological studies (39).
Indeed, in this study, we were able to conduct a large set of
complex biological studies, as well as compare the activity of
different agents against each individual tumor. Whereas, obviously,
clinical specimens and clinical response data are more valuable,
the detailed biological and therapeutic assessment conducted in
this work is not possible in the clinical setting, as patients are not
treated with more than two or three drugs, and available tissues
are not adequate in quantity and quality for broad biological
testing. We propose that this platform is useful for screening
purposes, and best candidate selection after that can be tested in
focused clinical studies.
Gene expression analysis has shown promise to characterize
cancer, as primary genetic alterations prompting or maintaining a
cancer phenotype ultimately manifested by differential expression
of genes required to sustain such a state. Whereas proteomic
assessment may be considered the ultimate step in these processes,
current technology has not produced proteomic tools ready for use

in a clinical scenario. Recently, a gene expression platform derived
from global unbiased testing received regulatory approval for risk
prognostication for breast cancer (14, 15). The potential applicability of the presented findings is that the core EGFR signature
could be readily incorporated to a quantitative tool, and this could
be explored in the context of a clinical trial. If successful, this
would represent avoiding unnecessary toxicities from inefficacious
treatments and a step forward in the individualization of anticancer care.
In summary, EGFR inhibition showed activity in a subset of cases
from a direct xenograft pancreatic cancer platform. This subset
was characterized by EGFR pathway up-regulation by gene
expression. The EGFR pathway activation only predicted response
