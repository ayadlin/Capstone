ABSTRACT
mTOR activation suppresses autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 at S757 and
suppressing its enzymatic activity. Here we report that feedback activation of mTOR
in the PI-3 kinase pathway by two p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) inhibitors (PF-4708671 and
A77 1726, the active metabolite of an immunosuppressive drug leflunomide) or by
S6K1 knockdown did not suppress but rather induced autophagy. Suppression of S6K1
activity led to the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, which then phosphorylated
ULK1 at S555. While mTOR feedback activation led to increased phosphorylation of
ULK1 at S757, this modification did not the disrupt ULK1-AMPK interaction nor dampen
ULK1 S555 phosphorylation and the induction of autophagy. In addition, inhibition
of S6K1 activity led to JNK activation, which also contributed to autophagy. 5Z-7oxozeaenol, a specific inhibitor of TAK1, or TAK1 siRNA blocked A77 1726-induced
activation of AMPK and JNK, and LC3 lipidation. Taken together, our study establishes
S6K1 as a key player in the PI-3 kinase pathway to suppress autophagy through
inhibiting AMPK and JNK in a TAK1-dependent manner.

include hypoxia, anticancer drugs, damaged organelles,
protein aggregates, and infectious agents. AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) sense energy stress and nutrient depletion,
respectively, and play pivotal roles in regulating autophagy
[1, 2]. AMPK directly phosphorylates ULK1 at S555 and
activates it or indirectly activates ULK1 by inhibiting
mTORC1 activity [3–5]. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase

INTRODUCTION
Macroautophagy (referred as autophagy hereafter)
is a highly conserved catabolic process characterized
by the formation of the double-membraned vesicles
(autophagosomes), fusion with lysosomes, and degradation
of cellular materials. Autophagy is activated primarily
by nutrient and energy stress. Other autophagy inducers

that interacts with several adaptor proteins to form the
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), phosphorylates ULK1/2
at serine 757 (S757), disrupts its interaction with AMPK
and prevents it from activating the autophagy pathway [6,
7]. Inactivation of mTORC1 by nutrient insufficiency or
by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, induces autophagy
[6, 7]. S6K1 is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of
mTORC1. S6K1 plays important roles in cancer, diabetes,
obesity, and ageing [8]. S6K1 depletion mimics the effect
of diet restriction [9, 10]. Interestingly, AMPK activity is
up-regulated in the skeletal muscle tissues and myotubes
of S6K1-deficient mice due to elevated AMP/ATP ratios
[9, 11]. Sch9, an equivalent of mammalian S6K1 in
yeast, has been reported to inhibit autophagy [12, 13].
Whether mammalian S6K1 also suppresses autophagy is
incompletely understood.
TAK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a
crucial role in regulating cell survival, differentiation,
apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. TAK1 is activated
by IL-1 and TGF-β receptors, Toll-like receptors
(TLR), CD40, and the B cell receptor [14–16]. TAK1
is involved in activating several intracellular kinases,
including p38, JNK, and I-kappa B kinase complex
(IKK) [17–20]. TAK1 plays a critical role in activating
the tumor suppressor protein LKB1, and AMPK T172
phosphorylation is inhibited in TAK1-deficient embryos
and in TAK1-deficient embryonic fibroblast cells [21].
Herrero-Martin et al. reported that TAK1 plays a critical
role in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)-induced AMPK activation [22]. InokuchiShimizu et al. [23] reported that TAK1 is required for
starvation-induced AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation
and activation, and plays a critical role in inducing
autophagy. Moreover, TAK1 deficiency partially blocks
rapamycin-induced autophagy in hepatocytes [23]. These
observations strongly suggest that autophagy induced by
mTOR suppression is in part mediated through TAK1. The
underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be defined.
A77 1726 is the active metabolite of leflunomide
(Arava™), an anti-inflammatory drug primarily used
for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Mechanistic studies
revealed that A77 1726 and its parental drug, leflunomide,
are capable of inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation and
pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis [24–31]. The ability
of A77 1726 to inhibit the activity of dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (DHO-DHase), a rate-limiting enzyme
in pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, is much stronger
than its ability to inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine
kinases such as p56lck, p59fyn, and PDGF receptor [24–28].
Recently, we reported that A77 1726 and its parental
drug, leflunomide, inhibit the activity of S6K1 in an in
vitro kinase assay and in cell culture, and that inhibition
of S6K1 activity by A77 1726 leads to the feedback
activation of the PI-3 kinase pathway [32]. Here we
report that mTOR feedback activation by A77 1726 or
PF-4708671 did not inhibit but rather induced autophagy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We also found that A77 1726-induced autophagy was
mediated through inhibiting S6K1 activity, subsequently
leading to activation of AMPK and JNK through TAK1,
and that activation of AMPK and JNK both contributed to
A77 1726-induced autophagy.

RESULTS
A77 1726 induces autophagy
Our recent study showed that A77 1726 suppresses
S6K1 activity and subsequently induces feedback
activation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in A375 cells [32].
Since mTOR activation suppresses autophagy [6], we tested
if mTOR feedback activation by A77 1726 also suppressed
autophagy. Unexpectedly, A77 1726 induced LC3-II
lipidation in a dose-dependent manner in A375 (Figure
1A), MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Figure 1B), and C2C12
myotubes (Figure 1C). Rapamycin included as a positive
control was less effective than A77 1726 to increase LC3II levels in A375 cells (Figure 1A). Leflunomide, the
parental drug of A77 1726, increased LC3-II levels too
in A375 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1D).
Increased LC3-II lipidation could be observed 8 hr after the
addition of A77 1726 and lasted up to 48 hr in A375 cells
(Figure 1E). Confocal microscopic fluorescence analysis
revealed that LC3 formed autophagosomes in A375 cells
in the presence of A77 1726, leflunomide, or rapamycin
(Figure 2A). Enumeration of autophagosomes showed that
A77 1726, leflunomide, and rapamycin all significantly
increased the number of puncta (Figure 2B). Increased
numbers of autophagosome puncta were also observed
in MCF-7 cells treated with A77 1726, leflunomide, or
rapamycin (data not shown). To determine if increased
LC3-II lipidation was due to the stall of autophagy flux or
was indeed due to the induction of autophagy, we tested the
effect of bafilomycin and colchicine on A77 1726-induced
autophagy. As shown in Figure 1F, A77 1726, bafilomycin
or colchicine alone increased the levels of both LC3-I
and LC3-II. Combination of A77 1726 with bafilomycin
or colchicine further increased the ratio of LC3-II to LCI, compared to bafilomycin or colchicine alone. These
results suggest that A77 1726 induces autophagy, and that
increased LC3-II levels are not due to the inhibition of the
autophagy flux.
As an inhibitor of DHO-DHase, A77 1726 inhibits
pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis [33]. To determine
if increased LC3-II lipidation was due to pyrimidine
nucleotide depletion, we tested whether exogenous uridine
blocked A77 1726-induced LC3-II lipidation. According to
our previous studies, exogenous uridine added into rapidly
proliferating cells or injected into mice can be readily
uptaken by cells and normalize intracellular pyrimidine
nucleotide levels [24, 26] Uridine (200 μM) itself had
no effect on LC3-II levels and did not block A77 1726(Figure 3A) or leflunomide-induced (Figure 3B) LC3

1726- or leflunomide-induced LC3-II lipidation in MCF7 cells (Figure 3C). Moreover, brequinar sodium (BQR),
a potent inhibitor of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, did
not increase but rather slightly decreased LC3-II lipidation
(Figure 3D).

mediated negative feedback activation of the MAP
and PI-3 kinase pathways [34]. As shown in Figure 3F,
PPP, an inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor; LY294002, a PI-3
kinase inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR,
were unable to block A77 1726-induced LC3-II increase
(Figure 3F).

A77 1726-induced autophagy is independent of
the feedback activation of the PI-3 and MAP
kinase pathways

Suppression of S6K1 activity induces autophagy
To investigate the role of S6K1 in mediating A77
1726-induced autophagy, we first examined the effect of
S6K1 knockdown on autophagy in A375 cells. As shown
in Figure 4A, S6K1 siRNA very effectively silenced
S6K1 expression. S6K1 knockdown led to decreased
S6 phosphorylation but increased the levels of LC3-II.
Consistently, S6K1 knockdown also led to the increase
of the number of LC3-RFP puncta (Figure 4C & 4E).
Similar to A77 1726, PF-4708671, a specific inhibitor
of S6K1, inhibited S6 phosphorylation but induced the

Our recent study showed that A77 1726 induces the
feedback activation of the PI-3 and MAP kinase pathways;
and that PLX4720, an inhibitor of Raf kinase, and U0126,
a MEK inhibitor, block A77 1726-induced phosphorylation
of ERK1/2T202/Y204 and MEK1/2S217/S221 [32]. Here we found
that these inhibitors did not change the levels of LC3-II
lipidation in the presence of A77 1726 (Figure 3E). The
IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase is responsible for S6K1-

by increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation (Figure

in a dose- (Figure 5A) and time-dependent (Figure 5B)
manner. mTOR phosphorylates ULK1 at S757 and inhibits
its activity as well as autophagy [6, 7]. mTOR is activated
by A77 1726 due to the feedback activation of the PI-3
kinase pathway [32]. As expected, A77 1726 induced
ULK1 phosphorylation at S757 in A375 cells in a dose(Figure 5A) and time-dependent (Figure 5B) manner.
Rapamycin had little effect on AMPKT172 and ULK1S555
phosphorylation but inhibited ULK1S757 phosphorylation
(Figure 5A). Consistently, A77 1726 and leflunomide
induced AMPKT172 and ULK1S555 phosphorylation in
C2C12 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C &

A77 1726-induced AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation.
As shown in Figure 6B, PLX4720, an inhibitor of B-Raf

little or no effect in A77 1726-induced AMPK and ULK1
phosphorylation at both S555 and S757.

and MAP kinase pathways on A77 1726-induced
AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation

Role of S6K1 in regulating AMPK and ULK1
phosphorylation
To confirm that A77 1726-induced AMPK and
ULK1 phosphorylation was mediated by inhibiting S6K1
activity, we tested if S6K1 knockdown or inhibition of
S6K1 activity by PF-4708671 also led to increased
AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation. As shown in Figure
7A, suppression of S6K1 expression led to increased
AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation at S555 and S757.
PF-470867 induced AMPK phosphorylation in a dosedependent manner (Figure 7B). Due to its strong ability
to induce the feedback activation of the PI-3 kinase
pathway, PF-470867 induced ULK1 phosphorylation at
S555 and S757 even at low concentrations (Figure 7B).
These results collectively suggest that inhibition of S6K1
activity plays a critical role in inducing AMPK and ULK1
phosphorylation.

We first determined the effect of the feedback
activation of the PI-3 kinase pathway on AMPK and
ULK1 phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 6A, all
three inhibitors of the PI-3 kinase pathway, including
the IGF-1 receptor (PPP), PI-3 kinase (LY294002),
and mTOR (rapamycin), did not significantly block
A77 1726-induced AMPK phosphorylation. All three
inhibitors had little effect on A77 1726 induced ULK1
phosphorylation at S555. In contrast, all three inhibitors
almost completely inhibited A77 1726-induced ULK1
phosphorylation at S757. These observations confirmed
that increased ULK1 phosphorylation at S757 is indeed
mediated by feedback activation of the PI-3 kinase
pathway through mTOR. We next determined if feedback

AMPK mediates A77 1726-induced ULK1
phosphorylation and autophagy

no effect on A77 1726-induced AMPK phosphorylation
but blocked A77 1726-induced ULK1 phosphorylation
at ULK1 S555 and LC3-II lipidation. CC blocked A77
1726-induced ULK1 S757 phosphorylation, probably
as the result of inhibition of raptor phosphorylation
and inhibition of mTOR activity [36]. In contrast, two
AMPK activators, oligomycin and metformin, induced
AMPK and ULK1 S555 phosphorylation (Figure 7D).

To confirm that the effect of A77 1726 on ULK1
phosphorylation was indeed mediated through AMPK, we
first tested if compound C (CC), an inhibitor of AMPK, was
able to block A77 1726-induced ULK1 phosphorylation
and LC3 expression. As shown in Figure 7C, CC had

through the MAP kinase-activated AP1 transcription
factor [38]. As shown in Figure 8A, A77 1726 increased
p62 levels after a prolonged exposure for 24 hr. Rapamycin
slightly induced p62 expression. A77 1726-induced p62
expression was time-dependent (Figure 8B). Induction of
p62 by A77 1726 or leflunomide was not due to its effect on
pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, since exogenous uridine
was unable to block A77 1726- or leflunomide-induced p62
expression (Figure 8C). The inhibitors of the MAP kinase
pathway, including PLX4720, U0126, and PD98059, had
no effect on A77 1726-induced p62 expression (Figure
8D). The inhibitors of the PI-3 kinase pathway, including
PPP, LY294002, and rapamycin, did not increase A77
1726-induced p62 expression (Figure 8E).

A77 1726 induces p62 expression
p62 is a ubiquitin-binding protein that sequesters
ubiquitinated proteins for lysosomal degradation through
interacting with LC3-II in autophagosomes [37]. The p62
level is usually decreased following autophagy induction.
However, p62 expression is induced by resveratrol, an
autophagy inducer, by transcriptional up-regulation

JNK activation is required for A77 1726-induced
p62 expression

10D). These observations collectively suggest that JNK
activation by A77 1726 is mediated by inhibition of S6K1
activity.

An earlier study showed that activation of JNK is
required for the increased p62 expression by resveratrol
in colorectal cancer cell lines [38, 39]. Here we tested
whether A77 1726 was able to activate JNK, subsequently
leading to increased p62 expression. A77 1726 induced
JNK and Jun phosphorylation in a time- and dosedependent manner (Figure 9A & 9B). SP600125, a
specific inhibitor of JNK, blocked A77 1726-induced Jun
and JNK phosphorylation. SP600125 also blocked p62
expression and LC3-II lipidation but had no effect on
A77 1726-induced AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation
(Figure 9C). These results suggest that JNK activation is
responsible for A77 1726-induced p62 expression.
The inability of SP600125 to block A77
1726-induced AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation
suggests that AMPK is not involved in A77 1726-induced
JNK activation. As shown in Figure 10A, oligomycin
and metformin, two AMPK activators, had no or little
effect on JNK and Jun phosphorylation nor induced p62
expression. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, was unable
to block A77 1726-induced JNK and Jun phosphorylation
as well as p62 expression (Figure 10B). S6K1 knockdown
led to increased JNK and Jun phosphorylation as well as
increased p62 expression (Figure 10C). Consistently, PF4708671 induced JNK and Jun phosphorylation as well
as p62 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure

Role of TAK1 in S6K1-mediated regulation of
autophagy
S6K1 negatively regulates the activity of TAK1
[40], a serine/threonine kinase that activates JNK [17–
20]. TAK1 also phosphorylates and activates LKB1
[21], a tumor suppressor responsible for AMPK T172
autophosphorylation and activation. Here we tested if
S6K1 suppression A77 1726 led to the activation of TAK1,
subsequently activating AMPK and JNK. As shown in
Figure 11A, A77 1726 induced TAK1 phosphorylation in
a time- and dose-dependent manner. A77 1726 treatment
also led to the presence of multiple bands, probably as
a result of ubiquitination (Figure 11A). 5Z-7-oxozeaenol,
an inhibitor of TAK1, blocked A77 1726-induced
phosphorylation of AMPK, ULK S555, JNK, and Jun
phosphorylation, and blocked A77 1726-induced LC3
lipidation (Figure 11B). TAK1 siRNA had similar effect
on A77 1726-induced protein phosphorylation and LC3
lipidation (Figure 11C). Co-immunoprecipitation revealed
that S6K1 interacted with TAK1, whereas A77 1726 and
rapamycin did not increase interaction of these two kinases
(Figure 11D). These observations suggest that TAK1 plays
a critical role in mediating A77 1726-induced activation of
AMPK and JNK.

DISCUSSION

inducing autophagy: 1) A77 1726 increased the levels of
LC3-II and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I (Figure 1); 2)
A77 1726 induced the accumulation of autophagosome
puncta (Figure 2); 3) bafilomycin and colchicine
increased A77 1726-induced LC3-II expression (Figure
1); 4) AMPK T172 and ULK1 S555 phosphorylation was
increased in A77 1726-treated cells (Figure 5). These
observations collectively suggest that A77 1726 induces
autophagy.

Leflunomide is a drug with multiple therapeutic
potentials, including immunosuppressive, anti-viral and
anti-cancer activities [41–43]. Our recent study showed
that A77 1726 is an inhibitor of S6K1, and that inhibition
of S6K1 activity leads to the feedback activation of the
PI-3 kinase pathway [32]. Our present study provides
several lines of evidence that A77 1726 was capable of

A77 1726 inhibits the activity of at least three types of
enzymes: DHO-DHase, protein tyrosine kinases, and S6K1
[26, 27, 32]. Exogenous uridine was unable to block A77
1726-induced LC3-II levels and autophagosome formation,
suggesting that A77 1726-induced autophagy is independent
of its inhibitory effect on pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. In
support of this notion, brequinar sodium, a much stronger
inhibitor of DHO-DHase than leflunomide, was unable to
induce LC3-II lipidation (Figure 3D). Activation of AMPK
plays a critical role in inducing autophagy [44]. S6K1
knockdown or inhibition of S6K1 activity by PF-4708671
led to AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation and activation
(Figure 7), and subsequent to autophagy (Figure 4). A77
1726 is an inhibitor of S6K1 activity in an in vitro kinase
assay and in cell culture [32]. AMPK T172 and ULK1 S555
phosphorylation was increased in A77 1726-treated cells
(Figure 5). We conclude that A77 1726-induced autophagy is
mediated by inhibition of S6K1 activity. During preparation
of this manuscript, Chen et al. [45] reported that leflunomide
induces autophagy in renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Though
A77 1726 inhibits PDGF receptor and Src family tyrosine
kinases [26, 27], it has no effect on insulin receptor and
IGF-1 receptor but rather stimulates IGF-1/IR-induced PI-3
kinase pathway through S6K1-mediated feedback activation
[32]. These observations suggest that A77 1726-induced
autophagy is not mediated through IGF-1/insulin receptor or

other receptor tyrosine kinases, but rather through inhibition
of S6K1 activity. In support of this notion, Blommaart et
al. [46] showed that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein
S6 is inhibitory for autophagy in isolated rat hepatocytes.
Shin et al. [47] reported that silencing S6K1 with siRNA
induces autophagy in HEK-293T cells. Consistently, Park
et al. [48] reported that PF-4708671 induces autophagy in
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.
We further analyzed the signaling pathway of
S6K1 suppression-induced autophagy. Kim et al. [40]
recently showed that in the TLR-signaling pathway, S6K1
negatively regulates the activity of TAK1. InokuchiShimizu et al. [23] reported that TAK1 deficiency leads
to the inhibition of starvation-induced AMPK and ULK1
phosphorylation and activation, subsequently suppressing
autophagy in the liver of TAK1-deficient mice. These
investigators further showed that TAK1 deficiency also
compromises rapamycin-induced autophagy in the
hepatocytes of TAK1-knockout mice, indicating that TAK1
is partially required for rapamycin-induced autophagy
(Figure 12). Consistent with these observations, we found
that inhibition of TAK1 activity by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol or
by TAK1 siRNA abrogated A77 1726-induced activation
of AMPK and JNK, reduced A77 1726-induced LC3
lipidation. These observations collectively suggest that
A77 1726 induces autophagy by inhibiting S6K activity,

leading to TAK1 activation, which then activates AMPK
and JNK (Figure 12). Of note, S6K1 deficiency leads
to AMPK activation in the skeletal muscle tissues and
myotubes of S6K1-deficient mice due to increased AMP
levels and AMP/ATP ratio [9, 11]. It is not clear if A77
1726-induced AMPK activation is also mediated in part
by increased AMP levels and AMP/ATP ratios.
ULK1 phosphorylation at S757 by mTOR
suppresses its activity and autophagy [6, 7]. In contrast,
ULK1 phosphorylation at S555 by AMPK leads to ULK1
activation and autophagy. Several other sites including

S317, S777, S638, S467, S556, T575 can also be
phosphorylated by AMPK but seem to have only marginal
effects on the activity of ULK1 [3, 6]. Since inhibition
of S6K1 activity by A77 1726 leads to the feedback
activation of the PI-3 and MAP kinase pathways through
the IGF-1 receptor [32], feedback activation of mTOR by
A77 1726 should suppress autophagy. Surprisingly, though
ULK1 was highly phosphorylated at S757 due to mTOR
feedback activation, A77 1726 did not inhibit but rather
induced autophagy. Moreover, A77 1726 induced AMPK
phosphorylation at T172 and ULK1 phosphorylation at

S555. These observations suggest that AMPK activation
through inhibition of S6K1 activity in A77 1726-treated
cells was able to blunt the inhibitory effect of feedbackactivated mTOR on ULK1 activity. Our further study
showed that rapamycin blocked A77 1726-induced
ULK1 S757 phosphorylation but did not further increase
autophagy (Figure 3). It appears that, when ULK1 is
phosphorylated by AMPK at S555 and possibly other sites
[3, 49], ULK1 activity can no longer be restrained by S757
phosphorylation. Consistent with our observations, Shang
et al. [50] reported that ULK1 S757 phosphorylation
transiently regulates autophagy and does not alter the
maximum capacity of autophagy after a prolonged
starvation. Kang et al. [7] reported that rapamycin is not
very effective at inhibiting ULK1 S757 phosphorylation
in vitro. Although ULK1 S757 phosphorylation disrupts
its interaction with AMPK, we found that mTOR feedback
activation and ULK1 S757 phosphorylation did not

ablate the interaction between ULK1 and AMPK in A77
1726-treated A375 cells (Figure 5E).
Our present study showed that A77 1726 induced
JNK phosphorylation and activation in A375 cells in a
time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 9). SP600125
blocked A77 1726-induced Jun phosphorylation and
p62 expression. Consistently, S6K1 knockdown and PF4708671 also led to increased p62 levels as well as JNK
and Jun phosphorylation. These results collectively suggest
that induction of p62 expression by A77 1726 is mediated
by inhibition of S6K1 activity and subsequent activation of
JNK. Puissant et al. [38] reported that resveratrol inhibits
the PI-3 kinase pathway and induces autophagy in a K562
chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. Interestingly,
resveratrol also activates JNK and transcriptionally
induces p62 expression [38]. JNK phosphorylates Bcl-2
and promotes its dissociation from Beclin, subsequently
promoting autophagy [51] (Figure 12).

Figure 12: Mechanisms of A77 1726-induced autophagy. A77 1726 inhibits S6K1 activity, leading to TAK1 activation that

subsequently activating AMPK and JNK. JNK activation leads to increased p62 expression and disrupts Beclin1 and Bcl2 interaction by
phosphorylating Bcl2. Although feedback activation of mTOR by A77 1726 leads to ULK1 phosphorylation at S757, it does not dampen
ULK1 phosphorylation at S555 and activation by AMPK. AMPK appears to be at the high end of hormone and metabolic signal pathways
that modulates nutrient and energy homeostasis through autophagy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our study suggests that increased p62 levels by
A77 1726 are due to JNK activation. Interestingly, p62
levels were not decreased in rapamycin-treated A375 cells
in which JNK activation was not observed. Although in
most cases, induction of autophagy by rapamycin leads
to the degradation and decreased levels of p62, Ju et al.
[52] reported that rapamycin induces autophagy but does
not reduce p62 levels in vitro in C2C12 myotubes and in
vivo in the muscle of rapamycin-treated mice. Kim et al.
[53] reported that activation of the MAP kinase pathway
can up-regulate p62 transcription. Rapamycin induces the
feedback activation of the MAP kinase pathway [54], it is
likely that rapamycin increases p62 levels through MAP
kinase pathway-induced transcriptional regulation of p62.
A77 1726 not only induces the feedback activation of
the MAP kinase pathway [32] but also strongly activated
JNK (Figure 10), and increased p62 expression much
stronger than rapamycin. It appears that JNK activation
plays a dominant role in mediating A77 1726-induced p62
expression. However, it remains enigmatic why indirect
inhibition of S6K1 activity by rapamycin did not activate
JNK.
He et al. [55] reported that AMPK phosphorylates
JNK in vitro, and that AMPK activation by metformin
stimulates its interaction with JNK. However, this
supposition is challenged since the amino acid sequences
in the activation loop sites of JNK do not contain the
AMPK consensus, and AMPK does not have a tyrosine
kinase activity [44]. Our study showed that the AMPK
inhibitor CC failed to block A77 1726-induced JNK
activation, while oligomycin and metformin activated
AMPK but had no or little effect on JNK activation
(Figure 10), suggesting that AMPK is not responsible for
activating JNK. On a cautionary note, since CC is not a
very specific inhibitor of AMPK [56], the concentration of
the compound C we used was relatively low and appeared
not capable of inhibiting the major enzyme involved in
autophagy. Furthermore, we found that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol
and TAK1 siRNA inhibited A77 1726-induced JNK and
Jun phosphorylation, suggesting that A77 1726-induced
JNK activation is mediated by TAK1 activation (Figure
12). Consistent with this notion, TAK1 plays a critical
role in activating the hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1
(HPK1)-induced JNK activation [17].
In summary, our study showed that inhibition of
S6K1 by A77 1726 led to the activation of AMPK and
JNK, both of which contributed to A77 1726-induced
autophagy. We further showed that AMPK phosphorylation
at T172 and activation led to ULK1 phosphorylation at
S555, which overcame the inhibitory effect of ULK1 S757
phosphorylation mediated by feedback-activated mTOR.
We further showed that A77 1726 activated AMPK and
JNK through S6K1 inhibition-mediated TAK1 activation
(Figure 12). Our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which
the mTOR-S6K1 pathway connects to the AMPK-ULK1
pathway through TAK1 to regulate autophagy (Figure 12).
