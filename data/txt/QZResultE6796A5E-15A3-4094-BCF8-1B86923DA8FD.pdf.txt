ERK1/2 Blockade Prevents Epithelial–Mesenchymal
Transition in Lung Cancer Cells and Promotes Their
Sensitivity to EGFR Inhibition
Janine M. Buonato1 and Matthew J. Lazzara1,2

Abstract
Overcoming cellular mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to drug therapy remains a central
challenge in the clinical management of many cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although
much work has linked the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells to the emergence of drug
resistance, it is less clear where tractable routes may exist to reverse or inhibit EMT as a strategy for drug
sensitization. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (mitogen-activated
protein kinase 3/1, MAPK3/1) signaling plays a key role in directing the mesenchymal character of NSCLC cells
and that blocking ERK signaling is sufﬁcient to heighten therapeutic responses to EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.
MEK1/2 (MAPKK1/2) inhibition promoted an epithelial phenotype in NSCLC cells, preventing induction of EMT
by exogenous TGF-b. Moreover, in cells exhibiting de novo or acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib,
MEK inhibition enhanced the sensitivity to geﬁtinib and slowed cell migration. These effects only occurred,
however, if MEK was inhibited for a period sufﬁcient to trigger changes in EMT marker expression. Consistent
with these ﬁndings, changes in EMT phenotypes and markers were also induced by the expression of mutant
KRAS in a MEK-dependent manner. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to MEK or ERK inhibitors may
not only restrain EMT but also overcome na€ve or acquired resistance of NSCLC to EGFR-targeted therapy in the
clinic. Cancer Res; 74(1); 309–19. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
EGF receptor (EGFR) overexpression and activation are
hallmarks of many cancers, including non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Consequently, a number of inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR have been developed
and approved for various cancers. Unfortunately, these drugs
are generally ineffective. In NSCLC, response to EGFR inhibitors is limited mainly to the rare patients (10%) whose
tumors harbor somatic, kinase-activated mutants of EGFR
(1, 2). Even these patients almost invariably develop resistance to EGFR inhibitors, often through the EGFR "gatekeeper" mutation (T790M; refs. 3, 4) or through upregulation of
the HGF receptor c-MET or other receptors (5). Combination
therapies present a possible strategy to overcome resistance.
In NSCLC, recent investigations suggest promise for combining EGFR inhibitors with chemoradiation (6), the multikinase

inhibitor sorafenib (7), or a c-MET inhibitor (8). Scheduling
multiple drugs such that initial therapy reprograms cells to
respond to another drug is another possible strategy. In one
recent example, triple-negative breast cancer cells and NSCLC
cells were dramatically sensitized to doxorubicin by pretreatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (9).
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is another pathway through which cancers of epithelial origin become chemoresistant. EMT is a developmental process whereby epithelial cells lose cell–cell adhesions to become more motile and
invasive. Cells undergoing EMT lose expression of epithelial
markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and gain expression of mesenchymal
markers (e.g., vimentin and ﬁbronectin) through differential
expression and activation of transcription factors including
Twist, ZEB1, and Snail (10, 11). EMT is frequently hijacked in
metastatic progression, and mesenchymal dedifferentiation
has been associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors, chemotherapy, and other targeted drugs in cancers of the lung (12–
14), bladder (15), head and neck (16, 17), pancreas (18), and
breast (19). In NSCLC, in vitro acquired resistance to the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib can result from the selection of a mesenchymal subpopulation (20), and restoring E-cadherin expression in mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells potentiates sensitivity to
EGFR inhibitors (21). In addition, growing evidence for AXLmediated EGFR inhibitor resistance has been tied to EMT (22).
Thus, developing treatments that elicit a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) could be a useful approach for expanding
the efﬁcacy of EGFR inhibitors.

Buonato and Lazzara

Several studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 or mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) 3/1 pathway activity in EMT induced by
TGF-b in nontransformed cells (23–25). ERK2, but not ERK1,
activity also induces EMT in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells (26) and has been implicated as mediating oncogenic KRAS-induced invasion in pancreatic cancer cells (27).
Interestingly, ERK2 ampliﬁcation was recently identiﬁed as a
mechanism leading to acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors
in NSCLC (28).
Here, we sought to determine ERK's role in governing EMT
in NSCLC. In a panel of NSCLC cell lines, inhibition of MEK1/2
(MAPKK1/2) prevented TGF-b–induced EMT and promoted
epithelial cellular characteristics when administered alone.
Conversely, augmented ERK activation, through KRAS12V expression or ERK2 ampliﬁcation, promoted mesenchymal characteristics. Furthermore, chronic MEK inhibition for times
long enough to observe changes in epithelial and mesenchymal
marker expression augmented cellular sensitivity to the EGFR
inhibitor geﬁtinib in cell lines with de novo or acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors. These changes were reversible
and accompanied by shifts in expression of stem cell-like
markers CD24 and CD44. These results suggest the potential
utility of drug scheduling strategies ﬁrst targeting ERK to
promote epithelial characteristics before targeting EGFR or
other oncogenic signaling nodes.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
H1666 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. H322, geﬁtinib-resistant PC9 (clone GR4, referred to
as GR henceforth), and WZ4002-resistant PC9 cells (clone
WZR12, referred to as WZR henceforth) were provided by Dr.
Pasi J€anne (Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Parental PC9 cells were provided by Dr. Douglas Lauffenburger
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA).
Because PC9 cells came from different labs, we conﬁrmed
similar expression of important proteins and response to
geﬁtinib for parental stocks from both labs. H358 cells were
provided by Dr. Russ Carstens (University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA). PC9 (all variants), H322, and H358 cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1 mmol/L
L-glutamine. H1666 cells were maintained in ACL4 (29). Cell
culture reagents were from Life Technologies. Cell lines were
validated for anticipated responsiveness to geﬁtinib and were
cultured for less than 2 months from low-passage frozen stocks.
Chronic MEK inhibition
H1666, PC9 GR, and PC9 WZR cells were maintained in 10, 5,
and 20 mmol/L U0126, respectively, with controls maintained
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Responses to 1-hour or 2-day
treatments with a range of U0126 concentrations were evaluated for each cell line to identify U0126 concentrations
yielding signiﬁcantly inhibited ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1) but minimal background cell death. For
culture experiments, media were changed every 2 days or cells
were passed as necessary. When passing, cells were subcul-

310

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

tured into inhibitor-free media to promote adhesion. U0126 or
DMSO was replaced the following day. When appropriate, cells
were lysed or geﬁtinib was added 24 hours later. Time points in
ﬁgures with chronic MEK inhibition reﬂect the total time of
U0126 exposure before lysing or geﬁtinib addition. To probe
the reversibility of U0126 effects, cells were split from U0126
cultures after 7 days and maintained in DMSO thereafter. All
time courses were performed from freshly thawed cells multiple times to demonstrate reproducibility. Na€ve cell death
response to U0126 and geﬁtinib was quantiﬁed at multiple
points during time courses, including the beginning and end, to
verify that the baseline response was not changing.
Wound-healing assay
Conﬂuent cell monolayers in 6-well plates were scratched
with a pipet tip, and media were immediately changed. Phase
contrast images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL
microscope (10 objective) every 1 to 3 hours for 11 hours
or less. Scratch areas were quantiﬁed using ImageJ, and closure
rates were calculated from linear ﬁts of areas versus time and
reported as percentage of total image area closed per hour
normalized to the conditions indicated in ﬁgures. Where
inhibitors were used, cells were plated at subconﬂuence and
treated at appropriate times with media containing inhibitor.
Media and inhibitor were changed every 2 days until wells
reached conﬂuence.
Transwell migration assay
Untreated PC9 GR and WZR cells or H1666 cells treated with
U0126 or DMSO for 4 days were trypsinized and resuspended in
media containing 0.1% FBS and U0126 or DMSO for H1666. Of
note, 20,000 untreated or DMSO-treated cells or 50,000 U0126treated cells (adjusted for U0126-mediated changes in adhesion)
were added to 8 mm Transwell membranes (Corning), which
were placed in 24-well plate wells containing complete media
with DMSO or U0126. After 20 hours, cells on the upper surfaces
were removed with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surfaces
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and washed
with PBS, and nuclei were stained with Hoescht-33342. Membranes were mounted and imaged (10 objective), and nuclei
were counted using ImageJ. Counts were normalized to the
number of adhered cells from parallel wells for each condition.
Flow cytometry
For cell death assays, cells were plated in 6-well dishes from
their various culture conditions and treated with inhibitors.
Floating and adherent cells were collected 48 hours later,
resuspended in PBS containing TO-PRO3 (Life Technologies),
and analyzed within 1 hour. For CD24 and CD44 measurements, cells were collected as above, washed with 0.1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS (PBSA), blocked for 10 minutes in PBSA,
and incubated for 1 hour with 3 mL each of ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate–conjugated antihuman CD44 antibody (BD
Pharmingen, #555478) and Alexa-647 conjugated antihuman
CD24 antibody (BioLegend, #311109) in 200 mL. Labeled cells
were washed again and resuspended in PBS. Cytometry was
performed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur cytometer, and
data were analyzed using FlowJo.

ERK Inhibition Prevents EMT in Lung Cancer Cells

Figure 1. MEK inhibition prevents TGF-b–induced EMT in NSCLC cell lines. A, H1666, H322, and H358 cells were treated for 4 days with 10 ng/mL TGF-b þ 50
ng/mL EGF, TGF-b þ EGF and 20 mmol/L U0126, or DMSO (control). Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against
indicated proteins. Images are representative of at least three independent experiments. B, H1666 cells on glass coverslips were treated as in A, ﬁxed, and
stained for E-cadherin, F-actin, and DNA. Images are representative of three replicates from each of two independent experiments. Scale bar, 20 mm.

Antibodies and other reagents
pERK T202/Y204 (#4377) and ERK (#4695) antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology. E-cadherin (sc-8426), vimentin
(sc-373717), ﬁbronectin (sc-8422), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; sc-32233) antibodies were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Stocks of U0126 and geﬁtinib (LC
Labs) were prepared in DMSO. Recombinant human EGF and
TGF-b were from Peprotech. Infrared dye- and Alexa Fluorconjugated secondary antibodies were from Rockland Immunochemicals and Invitrogen, respectively.
Additional methods
Western blotting, immunoﬂuorescence, KRAS12V expression, experiments involving CI-1040, chronic MEK inhibition
in H322, H358, and SKRB3 cells, and the EGFR internalization
assay were performed as described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Results
NSCLC cell lines undergo MEK-dependent
TGF-b–induced EMT
H1666, H322, and H358 cells were cultured in complete
media with TGF-b and EGF with or without U0126 for 4 days,
with a media change after 2 days (Fig. 1). In response to TGF-b
and EGF, E-cadherin expression decreased and vimentin
expression increased in all three cell lines, and ﬁbronectin
expression increased in H1666 and H358 cells (Fig. 1A). U0126
cotreatment inhibited changes in E-cadherin and vimentin, but
did not prevent ﬁbronectin induction. The same trends were
found in H1666 cells using the alternative MEK inhibitor CI1040 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The conditions used in Fig. 1A
were explored in H1666 cells by immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 1B).
Treatment with TGF-b and EGF promoted an elongated
cellular morphology and the appearance of F-actin ﬁbers, and

www.aacrjournals.org

decreased the E-cadherin intensity. U0126 addition prevented
E-cadherin loss and promoted E-cadherin localization at cell–
cell junctions.
MEK inhibition promotes epithelial phenotypes in
NSCLC cells
We next explored the ability of MEK inhibition alone to
promote epithelial characteristics in H1666 cells. As seen when
combined with TGF-b and EGF, U0126 promoted E-cadherin
localization at cell–cell junctions (Fig. 2A). MEK inhibition also
antagonized H1666 wound healing in a treatment time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3). Although
U0126 inhibited ERK phosphorylation within 1 hour of addition (Supplementary Fig. S1), U0126 treatment for the duration
of the scratch assay (10 hours) did not signiﬁcantly affect the
wound-closure rate ("at scratch" condition vs. DMSO in Fig.
2B). The wound-closure rate decreased signiﬁcantly with 1 day
of U0126 pretreatment and was nearly zero with 4 days of
pretreatment. Western blot analyses of lysates created in
parallel revealed that E-cadherin expression increased and
vimentin expression decreased with increasing the U0126
exposure time, consistent with the time-dependent changes
in the wound-closure rate (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3).
U0126-mediated changes in wound-healing migration were
further conﬁrmed by assessing migration across Transwell
inserts (Fig. 2D).
Chronic MEK inhibition sensitizes NSCLC cells to EGFR
inhibition on a time scale consistent with changes in
epithelial and mesenchymal markers
Because epithelial characteristics have been connected to
EGFR dependence in NSCLC (14, 21), we explored the ability
of MEK inhibition to increase sensitivity to geﬁtinib (Fig. 3).
As described in Materials and Methods, H1666 cells were

weeks. Throughout the 3-week period, cells were evaluated for
death response to geﬁtinib. Without U0126 pretreatment, 2
days of EGFR and MEK coinhibition led to only 7% cell death in
H1666, but this more than doubled with 3 days of U0126
pretreatment (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). This

decreased E-cadherin expression. Similar effects were observed in H1666 cells using CI-1040 (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
H358 and H322 cells and the breast cancer cell line SKBR3
were also evaluated for response to geﬁtinib following chronic
MEK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5). H358 cells harbor a
KRAS mutation and are ERK addicted (30). Not surprisingly,
therefore, H358 response to geﬁtinib was not augmented by
U0126 pretreatment. However, H322 and SKBR3 cells were

suggesting fairly broad applicability of this strategy.
We also probed the reversibility of the effects of chronic

U0126 exposure, removal from U0126 for 4 days completely
reversed changes in cellular sensitivity to geﬁtinib and epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression (Fig. 3C and D and

Stem cell-like subpopulations with intrinsic therapeutic
resistance are found within tumors (20, 31) and are typically
identiﬁed as CD44high/CD24low (20) or E-cadherinlow (32).
CD44high/CD24low enrichment from heterogeneous cultures
promotes mesenchymal behaviors including resistance to
EGFR inhibitors (20). Using ﬂow cytometry, we measured the
shift in the CD44high/CD24low subpopulation with U0126 addition and subsequent removal (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig.
S6B). U0126-treated cells had fewer CD44high/CD24low cells and
more CD44low/CD24high cells than controls. As with epithelial/
mesenchymal marker expression, U0126 removal for 4 days
reversed the effect on the CD44low/CD24high population.
KRAS12V-mediated ERK activation promotes EMT
To further probe the connection between ERK activity and
EMT, we expressed KRAS12V in H1666 cells. This produced an

314

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

anticipated increase in ERK phosphorylation and increased
vimentin expression (Fig. 4A). Geﬁtinib and U0126 promoted
an epithelial shift in control cells, as determined by Western
blot analysis and wound-closure measurements (Fig. 4A and
B). KRAS12V promoted maintenance of ERK phosphorylation in
response to geﬁtinib and largely prevented geﬁtinib-mediated
changes in marker expression and wound closure (Fig. 4A and
B). Importantly, the effects of KRAS12V were MEK dependent,
as demonstrated by the effects of U0126 (Fig. 4).
MEK inhibition antagonizes mesenchymal phenotypes
and acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition in an EGFRmutant–expressing cell line
We tested the effects of chronic MEK inhibition in a
panel of cell lines derived from PC9 cells, which express
EGFRdelE746_A750 and are geﬁtinib sensitive. In parental PC9
cells, MEK inhibition prevented TGF-b–mediated EMT and
drove changes in epithelial/mesenchymal marker expression
and wound healing consistent with the effects observed in
H1666 cells (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7).

A previous study derived PC9 cells that acquired geﬁtinib
resistance through EGFRT790M mutation (28). Another cell
line was then derived from these cells with secondary
resistance to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor WZ4002, which
potently inhibits EGFRT790M (28, 33). WZ4002 resistance
arose through ERK2 ampliﬁcation. We used these GR and
WZR clones to examine the effects of ERK2 activity, which
has been tied to EMT in nontransformed cells (26). WZR
cells displayed a more mesenchymal marker expression
pattern than parental or GR cells, with increased ﬁbronectin
and vimentin expression and decreased E-cadherin expression (Fig. 6A). WZR cells were also more migratory than GR
cells as measured by wound closure and Transwell migration
(Fig. 6B and C).
The effects of chronic MEK inhibition were tested in GR and
WZR cells, using a higher U0126 concentration for WZR
because of the ERK2 ampliﬁcation. Death response to cotreatment was enhanced by approximately two-fold within 3 days of
U0126 pretreatment in both cell lines (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B). As in H1666 cells, sufﬁciently long U0126
exposure resulted in an eventual decrease in augmented
response to EGFR inhibition. Increased sensitivity to geﬁtinib
correlated with reduced vimentin expression and slight
increases in E-cadherin expression, and the eventual decrease
in augmentation was accompanied by increased ﬁbronectin

expression in WZR cells (ﬁbronectin was not detectable in GR
cells; Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S8C).

Discussion
We characterized the role of ERK in regulating EMT in
NSCLC cells. MEK inhibition prevented TGF-b–induced EMT
in NSCLC cell lines expressing wild-type (WT) EGFR and KRAS
(H1666 and H322), WT EGFR and mutant KRAS (H358), or
mutant EGFR (PC9). This suggests a general role for ERK in
promoting mesenchymal characteristics across typical NSCLC
cell types. MEK inhibition also antagonized mesenchymalassociated characteristics including migration, resistance to
EGFR inhibition, and CD44high/CD24low expression.
The role of ERK in EMT has been explored in other cell types.
ERK is an established determinant of EMT in nontransformed
cells (23, 34–36), with ERK2 speciﬁcally implicated as an EMT
driver (26, 27, 37). This is consistent with ﬁndings in breast
cancer (38), where MEK inhibition reverses miR-21–mediated
EMT, and with studies of phosphatases regulating ERK (i.e.,
MKP3, PTPN14, and SHP2; refs. 39–41), which also suggest a
connection between ERK activity and EMT.
A number of factors regulate ERK activity in NSCLC cells. We
previously demonstrated a connection of impaired mutant
EGFR endocytosis with a diminished functional role of
SHP2 and impaired ERK activity (29, 42). More recently, in

collaboration with others, we identiﬁed a coupling between
ERK2 ampliﬁcation and increased EGFR endocytosis in the
WZ4002-resistant PC9 cells used here (28). Interestingly, inhibiting EGFR endocytosis in WZ4002-resistant cells reduced
ERK phosphorylation and promoted an epithelial marker
expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S9), drawing a potential connection between EGFR endocytosis and EMT. More
recently, Sprouty2 has been shown to promote ERK activity in
NSCLC cells with or without EGFR mutations (43).
Of course, KRAS mutations may also promote ERK activity in
NSCLC. In H1666 cells, KRAS12V-driven ERK activity promoted
mesenchymal marker expression and resistance to geﬁtinibmediated MET changes. These ﬁndings are generally consistent with studies connecting oncogenic HRAS or KRAS
mutants with EMT in mammary epithelia (26), pancreatic
cancer (27, 30), and lung cancer (30). The MEK dependence
of our observations with KRAS12V may support exploration of
MEK and ERK inhibitors in NSCLCs with KRAS mutation.
In addition to promoting epithelial marker expression, MEK
inhibition promoted response to EGFR inhibition. Some studies have suggested the efﬁcacy of EGFR and MEK coinhibition
in gastric cancer (44) and pancreatic cancer cells (45), and
current clinical trials are testing erlotinib combined with MEK
inhibitors in NSCLC. In light of this, it is worth noting that the
effects we observed with MEK inhibition occurred on a time
scale that was much longer than that for ERK inhibition and
more consistent with changes in epithelial and mesenchymal

marker expression. This may suggest considering a clinical
scheduling approach wherein a MEK inhibitor is initially used
alone to promote an epithelial phenotype, followed by addition
of an EGFR inhibitor. An analogous staggered drug scheduling
approach was effective in triple-negative breast cancer cells,
which were sensitized to doxorubicin by erlotinib pretreatment in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts (9). Applying this
basic concept to future clinical trial design may allow for lower
MEK inhibitor doses to curb toxicities (46) and promote
response to EGFR inhibitors. Given that the time windows for
augmented response to geﬁtinib and the useful concentrations
of U0126 were variable among cell lines, it will of course be
important ﬁrst to examine this strategy in preclinical animal
models to assess general efﬁcacy in an in vivo setting and
optimize timing and dosing.
We note as well that some recent data suggest that MET is
required for efﬁcient colonization of distant metastases (47,
48). Thus, in evaluating different potential strategies for driving
MET, the potential to drive proliferation of metastases will
have to be weighed against the potential ability to kill tumor
cells. ERK may be an especially attractive target in this regard.
In at least one study, ERK inhibition through microRNAmediated reduction of SHP2 (a positive regulator of ERK
signaling) reduced metastases in an in vivo breast cancer model
(49), which was due to SHP2's simultaneous regulation of
proliferation, invasion, and transcription factor expression.
Thus, promoting MET through ERK inhibition, which should

additionally inhibit cellular proliferation, may mitigate risks
associated with proliferation of micrometastases.
In all three cell lines we tested for effects of chronic MEK
inhibition, enhanced geﬁtinib response eventually decreased.
Though initially unresponsive to U0126, U0126-cultured cells
displayed noticeable cell death at mid-range time points (partially reﬂected by cell death measurements for U0126-only
samples in Figs. 3 and 7). This could result in selection for
U0126-resistant cells over time. Because the fraction of CD44high
/CD24low cells in U0126-treated cultures remained low at time
points when resistance was observed (Fig. 3C and E), the
potentially inherently resistant population was apparently not
CD44high/CD24low. Alternatively, resistance could arise from
adaptation of the entire cell population, for example, through
increased ﬁbronectin-mediated signaling, which has been
linked to AKT activation and docetaxel resistance in ovarian
and breast cancer cells (50). Indeed, in all cases, the eventual
drop in augmented response to geﬁtinib was accompanied by
increased ﬁbronectin expression. Future work should consider
effectors of ﬁbronectin-mediated signaling as signaling nodes
whose inhibition may augment EGFR inhibitor response.
Although our data suggest potential relevance of our ﬁndings to de novo and acquired EGFR inhibitor resistance,
responsiveness to chronic MEK inhibition was not uniform
among cell lines, which could result from any of the numerous
differences in initial conditions among NSCLC cell lines. For
example, although H1666 cells express WT EGFR and KRAS,
they also express the low-activity G446V BRAF mutant (51),
which could inﬂuence their death response to MEK inhibition.
In the future, therefore, investigating the cellular initial conditions that may determine responsiveness to this approach

and identifying alternative signaling nodes whose inhibition
may result in more stable maintenance of an epithelial cell type
will also be important.
