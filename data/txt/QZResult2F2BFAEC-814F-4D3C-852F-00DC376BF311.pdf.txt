ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor derived from poorly differentiated neural
crest cells. Current research is aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms
that maintain the progenitor state of neuroblastoma cells and to develop novel
therapeutic strategies that induce neuroblastoma cell differentiation. Mechanisms
controlling neural crest development are typically dysregulated during neuroblastoma
progression, and provide an appealing starting point for drug target discovery.
Transcriptional programs involved in neural crest development act as a context
dependent gene regulatory network. In addition to BMP, Wnt and Notch signaling,
activation of developmental gene expression programs depends on the physical
characteristics of the tissue microenvironment. TRPM7, a mechanically regulated TRP
channel with kinase activity, was previously found essential for embryogenesis and
the maintenance of undifferentiated neural crest progenitors. Hence, we hypothesized
that TRPM7 may preserve progenitor-like, metastatic features of neuroblastoma cells.
Using multiple neuroblastoma cell models, we demonstrate that TRPM7
expression closely associates with the migratory and metastatic properties of
neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, microarray-based expression
profiling on control and TRPM7 shRNA transduced neuroblastoma cells indicates that
TRPM7 controls a developmental transcriptional program involving the transcription
factor SNAI2. Overall, our data indicate that TRPM7 contributes to neuroblastoma
progression by maintaining progenitor-like features.

strategies for these patients, there is an urgent need to
understand the molecular mechanisms that control the
progenitor state of neuroblastoma cells. The similarities
between neural crest development and neuroblastoma
progression have previously been recognized [3–5]
and provide an appealing starting point for drug target
discovery.
The neural crest is a population of cells that
arises at the borders of the neuroectoderm during early
embryogenesis, spreads to different parts of the embryo
and gives rise to a multitude of cell types, including
the peripheral sympathetic neurons [6]. Mechanisms

INTRODUCTION
Neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumor derived from
cells of the neural crest. Survival rates are excellent for
patients with low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastomas.
In contrast, patients with high-risk neuroblastomas present
with metastatic disease at diagnosis and require intensive
treatment regimens. Although virtually all patients initially
respond to treatment, a therapy resistant pool of poorly
differentiated cells may arise that leads to refractory
disease for which no treatment options are currently
available [1, 2]. To develop more effective treatment

controlling migration and differentiation of neural crest
cells are typically dysregulated during neuroblastoma
development and progression. For instance genes
that maintain the balance between proliferation and
differentiation of neural crest cells, such as MYCN, ALK
and PHOX2B, are often found mutated or overexpressed
in high-risk neuroblastomas [3, 4]. Additionally, metastatic
neuroblastoma cells adopt a pro-migratory developmental
program known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), which allows neural crest cells to delaminate
from the neural plate borders and spread throughout the
embryo [7–10]. Consistently, in vitro evidence indicates
that genes involved in EMT of neural crest cells, including
transcription factors such as SNAI2, are misregulated in
metastatic neuroblastomas [4, 10, 11].
BMP, Wnt and Notch mediated signal transduction
pathways act in concert to control neural crest formation,
migration and maturation [6]. Additionally, mechanical
input from the cellular environment drives neural crest
maturation [12–16]. As these signals are essential for
proper tissue development and maintenance of cellular
quiescence, perturbed mechanical signaling can propagate
de-differentiation, uncontrolled cell proliferation, tissue
invasion and therapy resistance in solid tumors, including
neuroblastoma [17–29]. Members of the mammalian
Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channel
family are considered key regulators of the mechanical
interactions between the cell and its microenvironment.
Tethered to the cytoskeleton, their ion conducting
properties can be modulated by different stimuli, including
mechanical cues, resulting in responses that range from
adhesion remodeling to cellular differentiation [30–32].
Indeed, we showed that TRPM7, a TRP-cation channel
with kinase activity, directly interacts with the actomyosin
cytoskeleton and controls cell-matrix interactions in breast
cancer cells as well as in neuroblastoma cells [33, 34].
Moreover, we and others showed that TRPM7 functionally
contributes to the progression of a number of malignancies
in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in [35]). However, the
mechanisms by which TRPM7 drives tumor progression
remain poorly understood.
Studies using TRPM7 conditional knockouts
demonstrate that TRPM7 expression is required during
early stages of embryogenesis [36, 37]. Moreover, TRPM7
appears to be essential for the maintenance of multipotent neural crest cells [37]. Hence, we hypothesize
that TRPM7 expression and/or activity may contribute
to neuroblastoma progression by disrupting normal
neural crest cell maturation and preserving progenitorlike features in tumor cells. Consistent with this notion,
we show here that TRPM7 overexpression confers a
metastatic phenotype onto an otherwise poorly metastatic
neuroblastoma cell line, while shRNA-mediated
knockdown of TRPM7 reduces the migratory properties
of neuroblastoma cells. In addition, by gene expression
profiling we demonstrate that TRPM7 is required for the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

maintenance of a progenitor-like gene expression program
in human neuroblastoma cell lines.

RESULTS
TRPM7 confers a malignant phenotype onto
poorly metastatic neuroblastoma cells
To address if TRPM7 contributes to the malignant
properties of neuroblastoma cells, we assessed whether
TRPM7 overexpression promotes metastasis formation
of poorly metastatic murine N1E-115 neuroblastoma
cells in vivo. To this end, we intravenously injected
luciferase expressing neuroblastoma cells that were
previously generated to either overexpress mouse
TRPM7 (mTRPM7) or an empty vector control (Control)
(Supplementary Figure S1A) [33], into Rag2–/–Il2rg–/–
immunodeficient mice. Non-invasive bioluminescence
imaging was used to monitor tumor cell dissemination
and growth. Bioluminescence signals were observed at
day 7 post-injection and progressively increased over time
(Figure 1A & 1B), showing that injected cells survived,
proliferated and formed metastasis. In good agreement
with earlier reports on metastasis of neuroblastoma cells
in mice [38], bioluminescence originated predominantly
from the abdominal region. Strikingly, the abdominal
signal in N1E-115 mTRPM7 injected mice was much
higher at all time points (day 7: control = 5.41 × 104 ±
9.92 × 103 photons/s, n = 9; mTRPM7 = 9.75 × 105 ±
1.63 × 105 photons/s, n = 9). Note that the progressive
increase in bioluminescence was comparable in both
groups, suggesting that the in vivo proliferation rate
of neuroblastoma cells was not affected by TRPM7
expression levels (Figure 1B). Indeed, MTS assays
indicated that mTRPM7 overexpression did not affect in
vitro proliferation rates (Figure 1C).

TRPM7 promotes metastatic spread to liver and
bone marrow, but not in vivo proliferation
As the proliferation rate of N1E-115 mTRPM7 cells
did not differ from control cells in vitro, the increased
abdominal signals of mice injected with these cells suggest
that dissemination is more widespread. Histopathological
analysis showed that the dissemination pattern was similar
in both groups, with metastases predominantly present in
the liver (Figure 2A & 2B). However, image analysis of
liver paraffin sections demonstrated that much more tumors
were present in mice injected with N1E-115 mTRPM7 cells
(control = 9.5 ± 3.3 tumors per liver section; mTRPM7 =
79.7 ± 13.4 tumors per liver section; p < 0.01, n = 9) (Figure
2A & 2C). Consistent with the observation that TRPM7 does
not affect proliferation in vitro, mTRPM7 overexpression had
no effect on mean tumor size (control = 0.35 ± 0.13 mm2,
n = 118 tumors; mTRPM7 = 0.26 ± 0.03 mm2, p = 0.23,
n = 786 tumors) (Figure 2D & 2E).

TRPM7 expression does not affect viability and
proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells

In addition to the liver, bone and bone marrow
metastases are commonly observed in neuroblastoma
patients [39]. We therefore isolated bone marrow content
from each limb and analyzed luciferase activity. Limbs
were considered positive when bioluminescence was five
times above background. Strikingly, only one limb from a
single N1E-115 control injected mouse met this criterion,
whereas all mice injected with N1E-115 mTRPM7 cells
scored positive with an average of 3 affected legs per
mouse (control = 1 limb in 1 out of 9 mice; mTRPM7 =
9 out of 9 mice affected with 27 out of 36 limbs scoring
positive, p < 0.01) (Figure 2F). Hence, we conclude
that TRPM7 enhances the metastatic potential, but not
proliferation rate, of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells in vivo.

Although TRPM7 overexpression did not affect
proliferation of mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells,
others have suggested a role for TRPM7 in neuroblastoma
cell proliferation, specifically in a MYCN-amplified
context [40]. SH-EP2 is a non-neuronal (S-type) subclone
of the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line with no
expression of MYCN. In turn, MYCN is amplified in the
neuroblastic (N-type) subclone of SK-N-SH cells, named
SH-SY5Y [41]. As MYCN was essential for proliferation
of these cells [42], the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma model
provides a physiological relevant model to study the

functional interactions between TRPM7 and MYCN in
cell proliferation.
To see if and how TRPM7 affects viability
and proliferation of MYCN-negative and positive
neuroblastoma cells, we generated stable TRPM7
knockdown SH-EP2 and SH-SY5Y cells using a
previously characterized lentiviral shRNA construct [34]
(Supplementary Figure S1B & S1D). TRPM7 knockdown
did not markedly affect viability and proliferation of
MYCN-negative SH-EP2 cells, as we assessed by MTSassays (Figure 3A & 3B, Supplementary Figure S2A
& S2B). In contrast to previous reports [40], however,
stable knockdown of TRPM7 did not affect viability and
proliferation of MYCN-amplified SH-SY5Y cells (Figure
3C & 3D). To exclude the possibility that endogenous
TRPM7 expression levels were limiting MYCN-induced
proliferation, we overexpressed mTRPM7 in SH-SY5Y
cells (Supplementary Figure S1C) and subsequently
assayed viability and proliferation. Again, no effects of
TRPM7 expression levels were observed (Figure 3E & 3F).
From these experiments, we conclude that in our hands,
stable knockdown or overexpression of TRPM7 does not
affect viability and proliferation of both MYCN-negative
and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines.

TRPM7 targeting shRNA (Supplementary Figure S1D,
Supplementary Figure S2C–S2E). Overall, we conclude
that TRPM7 drives neuroblastoma cell migration.

TRPM7 maintains neuroblastoma cells in a
progenitor state
Since TRPM7 was shown to be required for
the development of neural crest derived tissues by
maintaining the pool of pluripotent progenitor cells
[37], we hypothesized that TRPM7 may contribute to
neuroblastoma metastasis by preserving progenitorlike, migratory neural crest cell features. We performed
microarray-based gene expression profiling and
identified 3015 genes that were significantly (p < 0,
05) up (1418 genes) or down (1597 genes) regulated
in neuroblastic SH-SY5Y TRPM7 shRNA cells, when
compared to control cells (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64000).
Subsequent
Gene Ontology (GO)-term analysis revealed 40 GO
categories within the ‘Biological Process’ subroot that
were significantly enriched (p < 0.01, > 10 genes per
category) (Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with a
role for TRPM7 in embryonic development [36, 37], GO
categories comprising organism and cellular development
were most significantly enriched (Figure 5A). Moreover,
a simplified graphical representation of relationships
between all 40 enriched GO-terms based on the directed
acyclic graph as presented by Webgestalt, clearly indicates
that genes affected by TRPM7 shRNA are involved in
neuronal differentiation (Figure 5B). Within the GO
category ‘Cell Differentiation’, we found many genes that
are well established to control neural crest development
as well as neuroblastoma progression. In view of the
complex crosstalk between these genes and the different
roles they play at distinct stages of development, it is
difficult to define in detail how the observed changes in
gene expression affect neuroblastoma progression. In
general, genes that promote neural crest development,
such as DLX5, LEF1 and MSX1 were upregulated,
whereas genes that are expressed by precursor cells or
suppress differentiation, including ASCL1, ID3, SNAI2
and STAT3, were down regulated (Figure 5C & Table 1).
Hence, TRPM7 expression appears to be inversely
associated with neural crest differentiation. Moreover,
genes that have previously been established to drive
neuroblastoma progression and migration, including
DBH, NOTCH1, RET and WNT1, were down regulated in
response to TRPM7 knockdown (Figure 5C & Table 1).
Combined with our in vitro and in vivo data, these data
support the notion that shRNA-mediated knockdown of
TRPM7 impairs the malignant potential of human SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells at the gene expression level,
by reducing a progenitor-like state.
It seems plausible that TRPM7 shRNA impairs
migration of neuroblastic SH-SY5Y by affecting genes that
control neuronal precursor characteristics. Despite the lack

TRPM7 promotes neuroblastoma cell migration
We previously showed that TRPM7 is required
for breast cancer cell migration [34]. Since metastatic
neuroblastoma cells adopt the migratory potential of
disseminating neural crest cells, we set out to evaluate
the effects of TRPM7 expression on neuroblastoma cell
migration. We first compared the migratory properties of
N1E-115 control and mTRPM7 cells by assaying migration
towards a serum gradient in Boyden chambers. Whereas
control cells remained immobile during 48 hours, mTRPM7
overexpression enhanced the ability of neuroblastoma
cells to cross the transwell membrane (191.5 ± 72 fold
mTRPM7 cells relative to control cells, p = 0.05, n = 6)
(Figure 4A). Similarly, mTRPM7 overexpression promoted
transwell migration of human SH-SY5Y cells (1.5 ± 0.078
fold mTRPM7 cells relative to control cells, p = 0.026,
n = 3) (Figure 4B). In reciprocal experiments, TRPM7
knockdown limited serum induced transwell migration of
SH-SY5Y cells (0.56 ± 0.049 fold TRPM7 shRNA cells
relative to control cells, p = 0.012, n = 3), as well as SHEP2 cells (0.36 ± 0.15 fold TRPM7 shRNA cells relative
to control cells, p = 0.049, n = 3) (Figure 4C & 4D). The
substrate adhesive characteristics of SH-EP2 cells allowed
us to assess cell migration in gap closure assays. Consistent
with serum induced transwell migration, reduced TRPM7
expression levels significantly reduced gap closure speed
(control = 5.4 ± 0.3 hrs; TRPM7 shRNA = 7.7 ± 0.26 hrs to
50% closure, p = 0.005, n = 3) (Figure 4E–4G). To control
for off-target effects of the TRPM7 shRNA, we confirmed
the effect of TRPM7 knockdown on SH-EP2 cell migration
using cells that were transduced with a second, independent

of neuronal features, TRPM7 shRNA similarly impaired
migration of epithelial-like SH-EP2 cells (Figure 4). This
suggests that TRPM7-mediated effects on gene expression
are not restricted to neuronal cells. We set out to define the
transcriptional program controlled by TRPM7 in SH-EP2
cells using a similar approach as described for SH-SY5Y
cells. We identified a set of 3322 genes that was differentially
expressed by SH-EP2 cells upon TRPM7 knockdown (1664
up, 1658 down, p < 0.05). Consistent with the large differences
between neuroblastic and epithelial-like neuroblastoma
cells, this set of genes showed only modest overlap with the
genes that were up or down regulated by TRPM7 shRNA
in SH-SY5Y cells (5.6% up, 7.1% down) (Supplementary
Figure S3B). GO-term analysis yielded 40 significantly
enriched categories within the ‘Biological Process’ subroot
(p < 0.01, > 10 genes per category), comprising a number of
developmental categories that were similar to those identified
in SH-SY5Y cells (Supplementary Table S2). However,
unlike in the SH-SY5Y cells, neurogenesis-related categories
were not found enriched in the SH-EP2 cells. Instead, many
GO-terms linked to cell migration were enriched in these
cells. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM7 in
SH-EP2 cells affected expression of genes involved in EMT,
a developmental transcription program that allows epithelial
cells to become migratory (Supplementary Figure S3A).
Transcriptional activators that contribute to EMT, including
SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, HIF1A and LEF1, were significantly
down regulated by TRPM7 knockdown, consistent with
reduced migration of SH-EP2 TRPM7 shRNA cells. Despite
the up regulation of some other EMT inducers such as SOX9
and EOMES upon TRPM7 knockdown, these results suggest
that TRPM7 maintains epithelial-like neuroblastoma cells in
a progenitor-like migratory state.
In search of transcription factors that are directly
controlled by TRPM7, we screened for transcriptional
regulators that were affected in both SH-EP2 and SHSY5Y TRPM7 shRNA cells (Supplementary Figure
S3C). In addition to LIN28B, POU4F1, ID3 and SNAI1,
SNAI2 was of particular interest since its expression was
most strongly reduced in both cell lines upon TRPM7
knockdown. Indeed, we confirmed by quantitative RTPCR that expression of SNAI2 was reduced upon TRPM7
knockdown in both SH-SY5Y and SH-EP2 neuroblastoma
cells (Figure 5D & Supplementary Figure S2F). Moreover,
overexpression of TRPM7 in the SNAI2 negative N1E-115
mouse neuroblastoma cell line induced expression of SNAI2.
Since SNAI2 is not only an important driver of neural crest
formation and migration [6, 10, 43], but also a determinant of
cancer stemness, migration and metastasis [4, 10, 11, 44], our
results indicate that TRPM7 maintains progenitor features of
neuroblastoma cells by controlling gene expression programs
that involve the transcription factor SNAI2.

and tissue homeostasis. Deregulation or dysfunction
of TRPM7 is associated with a number of pathologies,
including cancer [35, 45]. Despite the increasing number
of studies on the role of TRPM7 in cancer, data that
support the association between TRPM7 expression
levels and disease progression in patients are limited.
TRPM7 expression levels are increased in nasopharyngeal
carcinomas [46] and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
[47], and we showed in two independent cohorts that high
TRPM7 expression associates with poor prognosis of
breast cancer patients at time of diagnosis [34]. In a recent
publication, Zhang et. al. observed a strong correlation
between TRPM7 and MYCN expression levels in a large
neuroblastoma patient cohort (Kocak, n = 649) [40]. We
were able to confirm a positive association between TRPM7
and MYCN mRNA expression in two out of five additional
neuroblastoma patients datasets that are publically available
(Supplementary Table S3). However, neither in the Kocak
dataset nor in the other datasets did TRPM7 expression
associate with neuroblastoma disease stage, an important
prognostic marker. In only one of the datasets we found
TRPM7 to be associated with relapse, but not with
overall survival. Thus, increased TRPM7 expression may
correlate with MYCN expression, but whether TRPM7
mRNA expression associates with disease progression in
neuroblastoma patients remains to be established.
In this study, we show that TRPM7 overexpression
confers a malignant phenotype onto poorly metastatic
neuroblastoma cells in vivo. This is in close agreement
with our recent observations in breast cancer cells,
showing that TRPM7 shRNA-mediated knockdown
impairs breast cancer metastasis formation in a mouse
model [34]. Together, these experiments indicate that
high TRPM7 expression levels promote tumor metastasis
formation in vivo. A number of studies have suggested that
TRPM7 contributes to tumor progression by enhancing
cell proliferation [40, 48–51]. Using neuroblastoma
cells that are made to express high levels of MYCN,
experiments by Penner and colleagues suggest that
TRPM7 expression is required for MYCN-enhanced
proliferation of neuroblastoma cells [40]. However, using
neuroblastoma cells that express more physiological
levels of MYCN, we find that TRPM7 knockdown
and overexpression do not affect proliferation in vitro,
irrespective of MYCN amplification status. Moreover,
we find an increased number of tumors in mice injected
with mouse neuroblastoma cells that overexpress
TRPM7, rather than increased tumor size. Differences
in experimental approach may explain the discordance
between our observation and those reported in literature.
Whereas we stably overexpressed mTRPM7 or TRPM7
shRNAs by retro- and lentiviral transductions, and
subsequently selected viable cells, others manipulated
TRPM7 protein levels by transient expression of siRNA
oligos. In our hands, transient knockdown as well as
overexpression of TRPM7 induces cell death within 48
hours after transfection (data not shown). In agreement,

long term exposure to high concentrations of TRPM7
channel blockers reduces cell viability [48, 52, 53]. We
propose that by generating stable TRPM7 overexpression
and knockdown cell lines, we have modulated TRPM7
expression levels within a range compatible with normal
cell viability and proliferation.
High-risk metastatic neuroblastoma cells adopt
features used by neural crest progenitor cells to delaminate
from the neural border and to colonize different parts of
the embryo [4]. Using conditional knockout mice, TRPM7
was found to be required for the maintenance of multipotent neural crest cells during embryogenesis [37].
Hence, TRPM7 may drive neuroblastoma metastasis by
preserving neural crest-like progenitor features. Indeed, we
observed that TRPM7 expression is required for migration
of neuroblastic (N-type) and epithelial-like (S-type)
neuroblastoma cells, resembling the migratory potential of
neural crest cells [8]. Using microarray-based expression
profiling, we show that TRPM7 controls expression of
genes that regulate neural crest development (Figure 5
& Supplementary Figure S3). Gene ontology analysis
suggests that TRPM7 maintains an undifferentiated state
in N-type SH-SY5Y cells by controlling the expression
of neural plate border and neural crest specifiers, whereas
it preserves a motile phenotype in S-type SH-EP2
cells by controlling genes that drive the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition. It should be noted, however, that
genes controlling neural crest development play distinct
roles at different stages of development. Attributing genes
a specific role in neural crest development, i.e. neural
plate border and neural crest specification, induction
of migration (EMT) and late differentiation, is an
oversimplification of the complex crosstalk between genes
during development [6]. However, based on an extensive
literature search (Table 1), we postulate that TRPM7
knockdown redirects neuroblastoma gene expression
by reducing stemness and motility, and promoting
differentiation.
The limited overlap in genes that are controlled
by TRPM7 in the two cell models is reminiscent of
the concept that signaling inputs and transcription
factors involved in neural crest development act as time
and context dependent gene regulatory networks [6].
Since SNAI2 function is crucial to early neural crest
specification, as well as EMT-driven delamination and
survival of neural crest cells outside of the niche, down
regulation of SNAI2 expression may underlie the distinct
effects on developmental gene expression programs upon
TRPM7 shRNA in N-type and S-type neuroblastoma cells
[6, 10, 43, 44, 54].
Consistent with its function in neural crest
development [44], SNAI2 is an important driver of cancer
progression. SNAI2 expression is suggested to maintain
the pool of cancer stem cells, allowing tumor cells to
leave the primary tumor, colonize ectopic tissues, and
induce therapy resistance [44, 55, 56]. Moreover, SNAI2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drives EMT in neuroblastoma cells [10], and, reciprocally,
SNAI2 knockdown increases the sensitivity to apoptosisinducing compounds and impairs the metastatic potential
of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo [11]. Hence, our
results strongly suggest that TRPM7 maintains stem cell
features of neuroblastoma cells by expression regulation
of SNAI2.
Although the findings presented in this study are in
line with the accumulating evidence that TRPM7 plays a
crucial role during embryogenesis, cellular differentiation
and overall tissue homeostasis [35, 45], the precise signaling
mechanisms and transcriptional regulators involved remain
largely elusive. Supporting the idea that developmental
processes are controlled in a context-dependent manner,
TRPM7 activity is responsive to the physical characteristics
of the microenvironment [57, 58] and modulates
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation upon mechanical
stimulation [59]. In addition to activating Ca2+-dependent
transcription factors upon mechanical stimulation, including
STAT3 and NFATC1 [37, 59–61], TRPM7 may translate
mechanical cues from the microenvironment into gene
expression alternations by modulating cytoskeletal tension.
Actomyosin-driven cytoskeletal tension is an important
determinant of neural crest formation [62]. For instance,
reduced cytoskeletal tension promotes the expression of
neural crest specifiers including SNAI2. Consistent with
the association between TRPM7 and SNAI2 expression
levels in our neuroblastoma cell models, we previously
showed that TRPM7 activity induces cytoskeletal relaxation
in breast cancer cells as well as in neuroblastoma cells
[33, 34]. Although the mechanism by which TRPM7 affects
gene expression remains to be explored, our results suggest
a model in which context dependent activation of TRPM7
reduces cytoskeletal tension, and through activation of
transcriptional regulators that respond to cytoskeletal
dynamics, such as YAP/TAZ and SRF [63, 64], controls
the malignant features of neuroblastoma cells by promoting
neural crest stem cell properties. Future studies will
determine how alterations in cytoskeletal dynamics affect
the expression of SNAI2, and whether TRPM7-driven
SNAI2 expression contributes to neuroblastoma progenitorlike features. Ultimately, specific TRPM7 inhibitors such
as Waixenicin A [48], could potentially be used to induce
neuroblastoma differentiation, and may prove useful in
treatment of neuroblastoma in future (pre-) clinical studies.

Cell migration assays

Cloning of full length TRPM7-HA cDNA into LZRSneo was previously described [33]. Luciferase cDNA was
isolated from pMX-luciferase-YFP-neo and subcloned into a
retroviral pLZRS-IRES-zeocin vector. N1E-115 mouse and
SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing
TRPM7-HA and empty vector control were generated by
retroviral transductions. Transduced cells were selected by
the addition of 1 mg/ml G418. For bioluminescent imaging,
control and TRPM7 overexpressing N1E-115 cells were
co-transduced with a retroviral pLZRS luciferase reporter
construct and selected with 0.5 mg/ml Zeocin. Human
TRPM7 shRNA (5-GCGCTTTCCTTATCCACTTAA-3)
was introduced in SH-SY5Y (CRL-2266, ATCC) and SHEP2 (J. Molenaar, AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
cells, using the pLKO lentiviral expression vector according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). An independent TRPM7 shRNA was introduced in
SH-EP2 to control for off-target effects (TRPM7 shRNA#2:
5-TTGCCTGTAAGATCTATCGTT-3). A nonfunctional
shRNA (5-GCTACAAGAGAAACCAAATCT-3) was
introduced in SH-SY5Y and SH-EP2 cells to serve as
negative control. Transduced cells were selected with 1 μg/
ml puromycin.
The effect of TRPM7 overexpression and
knockdown on cell viability and proliferation was assessed
by MTS assays according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Madison, WI).

Following overnight serum starvation, cells were
harvested and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.1%
FBS. Subsequently, 50.000 cells were applied to a transwell
insert with 8 μm pore size (Corning Life Sciences, Corning,
NY), which was incubated in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS. N1E-115 and SH-SY5Y cells were allowed to
migrate for 48 hours at 37°C towards a serum gradient. SHEP2 cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hours. Migrated
cells were fixed (75% methanol and 25% acetic acid) and
stained (0.25% Coomassie Blue, 45% methanol, 10%
acetic acid in H2O). Gap closure assays were performed
according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Applied
Biophysics, Troy, NY). In short, 50.000 SH-EP2 cells were
seeded per insert and cultured overnight. After removal of
the insert, cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hours and
migration was followed by time lapse microscopy for 24
hours. Gap closure speed was quantified using ImageJ
(version 1.48) image analysis software

Mouse xenograft experiments
All animal work was performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Committee
(DEC-NKI-10.034).
Rag2–/–Il2rg–/–
immunodeficient
mice, backcrossed on a Balb/c background, were used for
metastasis experiments at 5–8 weeks old. N1E-115 mouse
neuroblastoma cells were trypsinized and washed 3 times
with PBS. Subsequently, 0.2 ml PBS containing 5*105 cells
was injected into a tail vein. Tumor growth was monitored
by bioluminescence imaging from day 7 onwards. Beetle
luciferin (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) was dissolved at
15 mg/ml in sterile PBS and stored at –20°C. Animals were
anaesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane. Luciferin solution was
injected i.p. (0.01 ml per gram body weight). Light emission
was measured 15 min later, using a cooled CCD camera
(IVIS; Xenogen), coupled to Living Image acquisition and
analysis software over an integration time of 1 min. Signal
intensity was quantified as the Flux (photons / s) measured
over the abdominal region. Organs and tissues were collected
at day 20 after injection, fixed in EAF (ethanol-acetic
acid-formol saline fixative, 40:5:10:45 v/v) and processed
routinely for histology preparations. The paraffin sections
were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). For
quantitative analysis of the neoplastic lesions, liver sections
(9 sections from each liver) were stained with Haematoxylin
and Eosin. Liver tumors were quantified under a microscope
and the data were further processed by Image J (version 1.48).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total mRNA isolation (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) was followed by SuperScript cDNA synthesis
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), according to
manufacturer’s protocols. TRPM7 mRNA expression
levels in N1E-115, SH-EP2 and SH-SY5Y cells were
determined by quantitative PCR reactions using
power SYBR-green reagent (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA) in combination with mouse specific
(forward: TAGCCTTTAGCCACTGGACC; reverse:
GCATCTTCTCCTAGATTGGCAG)
or
human
specific (forward: TAGCCTTTAGCCACTGGAC;
reverse:
GCATCTTCTCCTAGATTTGC)
TRPM7 primers according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. Using the similar approach,
SNAI2 levels were determined using mouse specific
(forward: GGCTGCTTCAAGGACACATT; reverse:
GGTTTTGGAGCAGTTTTTGC)
and
human
specific (forward: AGATGAGCATTGGCAGCGAG;
reverse: AAGCATTTCAACGCCTCCAAA) SNAI2
primers. Mouse and human TRPM7 and SNAI2
mRNA expression levels were normalized to the
mouse (forward: GCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC;
reverse: GAGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTT) or human
(forward: CTCCTCCACCTTTGACGCTG; reverse:
TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA) GAPDH housekeeping
genes respectively, and calculated according to the cycling
threshold method [65].

(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were
measured using the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE. U.S.A). RNA
quality and integrity were determined using Lab-onChip analysis on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A). Biotinylated
cRNA was prepared using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA
Amplification Kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, U.S.A)
according to manufacturer’s specifications with an input
of 200 ng total RNA. Per sample, 750 ng of the obtained
biotinylated cRNA samples was hybridized onto the
Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
CA, U.S.A). Hybridization and washing were performed
according to the Illumina Manual ‘Direct Hybridization
Assay Guide’. Scanning was performed on the Illumina
iScan (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, U.S.A). Image
analysis and extraction of raw expression data was
performed with Illumina GenomeStudio v2011.1 Gene
Expression software. Arrays were normalized in Arraystar
(v. 4.03), using Robust-Multi-Array normalization. Fold
difference and P-values were calculated using Multi
Experiment Viewer (v. 4.8.1). GO-term analysis was
performed using Webgestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/
webgestalt/) on genes that were significantly (p < 0.05)
up or down regulated. Vennmaster (http://sysbio.uniulm.de/?Software:VennMaster) was used to determined
the overlap in genes that were significantly up or down
regulated in SH-SY5Y and SH-EP2 TRPM7 shRNA cells.
