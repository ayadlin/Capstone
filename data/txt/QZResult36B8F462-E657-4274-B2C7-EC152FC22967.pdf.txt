ABSTRACT
The G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is methylated and silenced in a wide range
of human cancers. The protein encoded by G0S2 is an endogenous inhibitor of
lipid catabolism that directly binds adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). ATGL is the
rate-limiting step in triglyceride metabolism. Although the G0S2 gene is silenced
in cancer, the impact of ATGL in the growth and survival of cancer cells has never
been addressed. Here we show that ectopic expression of G0S2 in non-small cell
lung carcinomas (NSCL) inhibits triglyceride catabolism and results in lower cell
growth. Similarly, knockdown of ATGL increased triglyceride levels, attenuated
cell growth and promoted apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous G0S2
enhanced the growth and invasiveness of cancer cells. G0S2 is strongly induced in
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in response to all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
and we show that inhibition of ATGL in these cells by G0S2 is required for efficacy of
ATRA treatment. Our data uncover a novel tumor suppressor mechanism by which
G0S2 directly inhibits activity of a key intracellular lipase. Our results suggest that
elevated ATGL activity may be a general property of many cancer types and potentially
represents a novel target for chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

condensation of three fatty-acyl moieties to glycerol. The
hydrolysis and mobilization of FA from TGs, is controlled
by specific lipases in the triglyceride/free fatty acid (TG/
FFA) cycle. The TG/FFA cycle is a coordinated cycle
of lipid catabolism breaking down TGs stepwise into
FFAs and glycerol. The intracellular lipolytic pathway
is regulated by a series of enzymes each responsible of
hydrolyzing a specific lipid molecule. Adipose triglyceride
lipase (ATGL), initiates the process of TG metabolism by
hydrolyzing TGs into diacylglycerol (DAG) and FA [1012]. The subsequent step requires hormone sensitive lipase
(HSL) which breaks down DAG into monoacylglycerol
(MAG) and FA [13]. Finally, MAG is further broken down
into FA and glycerol by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)
[14].
The TG/FFA cycle appears to be accelerated in
cancer with activity of both the synthetic and catabolic
arms becoming elevated. MAGL activity was recently
shown to be dramatically upregulated in human cancer

Reprogramming of metabolic networks is an
emerging hallmark of cancer cells [1]. For example,
enhanced glycolysis (Warburg effect), is a very general
property of tumor cells [2]. Reprogramming of lipid
metabolism is not as well understood although several
studies suggest that these pathways are also extensively
altered in cancer cells. Lipogenesis is markedly increased
in cancer cells [3-9]. Enzymes of lipid biosynthesis,
including ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, acetylCoA carboxylase-1, dicarboxylate transporter and malic
enzyme are upregulated in many cancer types and
abrogation of their activity often leads to apoptosis and/
or growth arrest [3-9].
Fatty acids (FA) in most tissues are first converted
to triglycerides (TGs) and stored in specialized organelles
called lipid droplets. TGs are synthesized by the

which rendered tumor cells highly aggressive [15]. MAGL
expression is elevated several fold in ductal breast cancer
cells and was shown to play a role in the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells [16].
MAGL regulates a network of oncogenic signaling lipids,
which likely promote migration, invasion, and tumour
growth [15, 17]. MAGL was also shown to be essential for
the proliferation and tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer
cells as either its inhibition or deletion led to attenuated
tumour growth and cancer cell proliferation [18]. Although
the importance of elevated MAGL activity in cancer
has been demonstrated, the rate-limiting enzyme of TG
catabolism is ATGL and thus far no mechanism has been
proposed suggesting how this initiating enzyme in TG
lipolysis becomes elevated in cancer.
The G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) encodes an
endogenous inhibitor of ATGL [19]. The name G0S2
derives from the fact that it was initially identified in
monocytes as a gene upregulated during transition from
G0 to G1 phases of the cell cycle [20, 21]. The G0S2
gene encodes a small 12kDa protein that localizes to
the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum [22, 23]
and is expressed in most tissues, with the highest levels
in adipose tissues and liver [19]. G0S2 directly inhibits
lipase activity by interacting with the N-terminal patatin
domain of ATGL [24]. Three properties of G0S2 suggest
that the protein functions as a tumor suppressor. First, the
G0S2 gene has a potent CpG island in the promoter region
[20] and work from several groups have demonstrated
that the gene is silenced in many types of human cancer
including head and neck cancer [25], glioma [26]
lung [27, 28] and breast cancer [22]. Second, ectopic
expression of G0S2 in a variety of human tumor cells
promotes cell death [22] and can also inhibit proliferation
of hematopoietic stem cells and CML [29, 30]. Lastly,
knockdown of G0S2 expression in primary mouse embryo
fibroblasts was shown to enhance oncogene-induced cell
transformation [22]. Although G0S2 has the properties of
a tumor suppressor, it has never been determined if ATGL
inhibition is required for G0S2 mediated suppression of
cell growth.
In the current study we show that the tumor
suppressor properties of G0S2 are derived at least in part
from its capacity to inhibit ATGL. Inhibition of ATGL by
G0S2, RNAi, or a small molecule inhibitor was able to
attenuate the growth and motility of tumor cells. These
data show that G0S2 encodes a tumour suppressor
protein that links regulation of lipid catabolism to cell
transformation and suggests that ATGL may be a novel
target to limit growth of tumour cells.

Ectopic expression of G0S2 results in elevated
cellular TG levels and inhibits the growth,
survival and motility of cancer cells
G0S2 has the general properties of a tumor
suppressor protein and appears to play a major role in
lipid metabolism by binding ATGL and suppressing lipase
activity [31-33]. It is not known if the growth inhibitory
properties of G0S2 stem from its ability to inhibit ATGL
or other functions. To further study the tumor suppressor
activity of G0S2, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCL)
cell lines that stably express G0S2 were generated. NSCL
cells were selected as a model since the G0S2 gene was
shown to be methylated and silenced in this cancer type
and re-expression of the gene was shown to induce death
[22, 27, 28]. A549 and HOP62 cells were transduced
with retrovirus expressing either FLAG-tagged G0S2
or empty vector controls (EV). Figure 1A and 1B show
that G0S2 expression resulted in slower growth in both
A549 and HOP62 lines. In addition to slow growth, G0S2
expressing cell lines also displayed greater sensitivity to
the chemotherapy agent Camptothecin (Figure 1C and
1D). Expression of FLAG-G0S2 in the cell lines was
confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-FLAG
antibody (Figure 1E).
In order to determine if expression of G0S2
was able to inhibit the lipase activity of ATGL, A549
cells were loaded with oleic acid for 5 hours and total
cellular triglyceride (TG) levels were measured and
normalized to total protein. Figure 1F shows that A549
cells expressing G0S2 maintained significantly more TG
relative to EV control. G0S2 was previously shown to
directly interact with ATGL in metabolic tissues such as
adipose tissue and liver [19]. In figure 1G we show using
co-immunoprecipitation that FLAG-G0S2 also forms a
complex with endogenous ATGL in A549 cells. These data
show that re-expression of G0S2 in NSCL cell lines, which
is commonly methylated and silenced in these cells, results
in slow growth, increased susceptibility to apoptosis and
accumulation of TG through ATGL inhibition.

Knockdown of G0S2 enhances cell growth and
motility in colorectal cancer cells
The study of endogenous G0S2 in cancer cells is
complicated by the fact that the gene is highly methylated
and silenced in most tumor-derived cell lines. Although
we were unable to detect G0S2 protein in NSCL cell lines,
the colorectal cell line HT29 did show an appreciable
immunoblot signal for G0S2. Figure 2A shows that when
expression of G0S2 is silenced in HT29 cells using a stable
shRNA, cell growth is significantly increased. Expression

metabolism by binding and inhibiting ATGL, we
hypothesized that knockdown of ATGL would have
similar biological effects as ectopic expression of G0S2.
Figure 2E shows that knockdown of ATGL using a stable
shRNA hairpin significantly inhibited the growth of HT29
cells. Knockdown of ATGL was confirmed by western
blot analysis shown in figure 2F. These data indicate that
elevated ATGL activity in tumor cells enhances the growth
properties of the cells and that inhibition of ATGL by
either expression of G0S2 or knockdown of ATGL results
in slower cell growth.

that ATGL inhibition may explain some of the tumor
suppressor properties displayed by G0S2 in NSCL. In
order to test this hypothesis we determined if knockdown
of ATGL expression using RNAi affected the growth
properties of NSCL carcinoma cell lines. Figure 3A shows
that stable expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
inhibiting ATGL expression significantly inhibited the
growth of three different NSCL lines (HOP92, HOP62 and
A549) relative to non-silencing (NS) control. In order to
confirm that ATGL enzymatic activity was being affected
in the knockdown cells, total TG levels were measured
and normalized to total protein. Figure 3B shows that TG
levels were significantly elevated in ATGL knockdown
cells indicating that the capacity of ATGL to hydrolyze
TG in these cells was compromised. Knockdown of ATGL
in these cells was confirmed by western blot (Figure
3C). Since we previously observed that expression of
G0S2 could induce cell death or sensitize cells to killing

NSCL cells. A modified Boyden chamber assay was used
in which the xCELLigence system monitored serummediated motility in real-time. Figure 4C and 4D showed
that knockdown of ATGL in HOP62 and A549 cells
resulted in reduced motility. A recent study suggested that
knockdown of ATGL in colorectal cancer cells resulted in
elevated phospho-AMPK and p53 [34]. Figure 4E shows
that knockdown of ATGL in A549 cells also resulted in
elevated phospho-AMPK suggesting that the mechanism
of slow growth may be due to activation of the p53
pathway through AMPK. Taken together, these data show
that inhibition of activity of the intracellular lipase ATGL
can have a significant impact on the growth, motility and
sensitivity to cell death of NSCL cells.

in vivo and in vitro [35]. Atglistatin was shown to be a
highly selective inhibitor for ATGL without affecting
other intracellular lipases such as MAGL or HSL. As
expected, treatment with Atglistatin also resulted in the
accumulation of TG in cells confirming that enzymatic
activity of ATGL was being effectively inhibited (Figure
5A). We therefore determined if Atglistatin was also
able to inhibit the growth of NSCL lines. Figure 5B and
5C show that Atglistatin was able to inhibit the growth
of A549 and HOP62 cells in a concentration dependent
manner. Since we showed in Figure 2 that G0S2 could
inhibit the motility of HT29 cells, we performed the
same assay using Atglistatin. Figure 5D and 5E show that
Atglistatin was able to inhibit the motility of HT29 cells
using a scratch assay. These results show that a specific
small molecule inhibitor of ATGL can slow the growth
of cancer cells and that ATGL is a potential target for
chemotherapy.

A chemical inhibitor of ATGL suppresses the
growth of tumor cells
Findings from several groups demonstrated that
expression of G0S2 is silenced across a wide-range of
tumor types. Since G0S2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor
of ATGL activity, it is possible that elevated ATGL activity
is a general property of cancer cells and thus represents an
attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Recently, a
highly specific inhibitor of ATGL activity was developed
termed Atglistatin that was shown to be effective both

Leukemia (APL) cells [36]. ATRA is the frontline therapy
for APL and the induction of G0S2 expression in this
system suggests that the tumor suppressor properties of
the protein may play a role in the response to the drug. We
confirmed previous observations showing that treatment
of the APL cell line NB4 with ATRA results in the potent
induction of G0S2 protein over three days (Figure 6A).
Intriguingly, whereas levels of G0S2 are elevated with
ATRA treatment, we observed ATGL levels are decreased.
This suggests that suppression of TG metabolism is an
important process in the differentiation program induced
by ATRA. Endogenous TG levels in NB4 cells treated
with ATRA were significantly elevated after 5 and 7 days
of ATRA treatment relative to DMSO treated-controls
(Fig. 6B). This result indicates that G0S2 induction in
NB4 cells resulted in inhibition of ATGL activity as shown
by increased TG levels.
In order to determine if G0S2 expression plays a
role in the response of NB4 cells to ATRA, we transduced
these cells with two different lentivirus vectors encoding
shRNAs targeting G0S2. Figure 6C shows that both
shRNA constructs were able to attenuate the induction of
G0S2 in response to ATRA. Interestingly, NB4 cells in
which G0S2 is silenced were significantly more resistant to
ATRA-induced growth arrest than control cells expressing
a non-silencing control (Figure 6D and 6E) suggesting that
G0S2 is required at least in part for the inhibition of cell
growth in response to ATRA. Furthermore, treatment of
NB4 cells with Atglistatin in the absence of ATRA was
also able to inhibit NB4 cell growth (Figure 6F). Taken
together these data show that the induction of G0S2
expression during ATRA differentiation therapy of PML
inhibits TG catabolism and cell growth.

these cells more aggressive [15]. In the same study,
elevated MAGL activity was shown to increase production
of fatty acid derived signaling molecules, which in turn
enhances cell growth and motility. MAGL is the last step
in TG catabolism resulting in glycerol and non-esterified
fatty acids as final products. Since ATGL is the first step
in TG catabolism, it is tempting to speculate that observed
increases in MAGL activity may be due to loss of G0S2
in cancer cells, leading to enhanced ATGL activity by
generating substrates for MAGL. An obvious explanation
for reduced cell growth caused by ATGL inhibition would
simply be the loss of a potent energy source. The intense
energy demands of rapidly dividing cells may necessitate
tapping the dense energy pools stored in triglycerides and
G0S2 may function as a checkpoint preventing access to
energy supplied by oxidation of fatty acids.
Study of the yeast ortholog of ATGL (Tgl4) has
shown that lipase activity of Tgl4 is required for proper
cell cycle progression. Tgl4 activity was shown to be
activated through phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent
kinase Cdk1/Cdc28 (ortholog of mammalian Cdc2).
Interestingly, mutation of the Cdk1 phosphorylation sites
on Tgl4 resulted in delayed cell cycle entry [37]. It remains
to be determined if lipolysis in mammals is under similar
cell cycle control, however, examination of the primary
amino acid sequence of mammalian ATGL reveals that
cdk1 consensus sites exist at serine 185 and threonine 489.
In the case of yeast, activation of lipase activity occurs
at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, which coincides
with bud emergence, which requires increased amounts
of fatty acids. Yeast does not appear to have a homolog of
G0S2 but the requirement for precise regulation of ATGLlike activity during the cell cycle establishes an intriguing
precedent and it will be interesting to determine if similar
regulation occurs in mammals.
Our results showing that ATGL knockdown can
inhibit cell growth is in accordance with a recent study
by Ou et al. who showed that knockdown of ATGL in
HCT116 colorectal cancer cells resulted in a slow growth
phenotype and elevated phospho-AMPK and p53 [34].
Intriguingly, in the same study the authors observed that
knockdown of the ATGL co-activator, cgi-58 (also known
as Abhd5) resulted in cellular transformation and enhanced
growth and cell motility. The opposite phenotype of cgi58 knockdown suggests that this protein has tumour
suppressor effects that are independent of ATGL.
A recent study demonstrated that G0S2 is able to
suppress the growth of the chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) cell line, K562 both in vitro and in mouse
xenografts [30]. Like in many other tumor cells, the
promoter of G0S2 was shown to be methylated in
K562 cells is reversed using the methylation inhibitor
5-Azacytadine (5-Aza). In this study the authors propose
that the mechanism of action of G0S2 was through
interaction with nucleolin, which caused the retention of
nucleolin in the cytosol and inhibits its growth promoting

DISCUSSION
The G0S2 gene has the general properties of a
tumour suppressor and has been shown to be a potent
negative regulator of triglyceride catabolism. In the
current study we show for the first time that the inhibition
of ATGL by G0S2 can significantly reduce the growth and
motility of a variety of tumour cell lines. Furthermore,
inhibition of ATGL using either RNAi or a chemical
inhibitor can similarly slow the growth of tumor cells.
Since G0S2 expression is reduced in such a wide range
of cancer cell types, this implies that elevated ATGL
activity may be a common property of cancer cells and
may represent a novel target for cancer therapy. These
observations also highlight the growing importance
of altered lipid metabolism in the process of cell
transformation and cancer.
The reason(s) why inhibition of intracellular
lipase activity may interfere with cell division have yet
to be fully explained. A recent paper demonstrated that
Monoacylgycerol lipase (MAGL) activity is upregulated
in some cancer cells thus rendering tumors derived from

functions. The same group also demonstrated that
G0S2 was able to maintain quiescence of hematopoetic
stem cells also through interaction with nucleolin [29].
Consistent with these findings, G0S2 was found to be
a target of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in human
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells [38]. ATRA
treatment induces terminal differentiation of APL cells
and is known to be a highly effective therapy against
this form of leukemia (reviewed in [39]). Both mRNA
and protein levels of G0S2 were rapidly induced in APL
cell line, NB4, and in APL transgenic mice treated with
ATRA [38]. In our current study we demonstrate that
induction of G0S2 expression in NB4 cells results in
elevated TG levels that are likely due to inhibition of
ATGL. In addition, knockdown of G0S2 attenuated the
effects of ATRA and inhibition of ATGL alone was able to
inhibit the growth of NB4 cells. Although several binding
partners have been shown for G0S2 including Bcl2 [22],
ATGL [19] and Nucleolin [29], our studies suggest that
inhibition of ATGL can attenuate cell growth in a wide
range of tumour cells and is an important mechanism of
G0S2-mediated growth inhibition.
Impressively, over the past few months there has
been a succession of four papers independently describing
the phenotype of a G0S2 knockout mouse [31-33, 40].
For the most part, each of these studies support the view
that G0S2 is a key regulator of lipolysis in vivo. G0S2
knockout mice are lean, resistant to obesity by high
fat feeding, glucose tolerant, insulin sensitive, and are
more thermogenic. Although no studies have thus far
reported experiments examining tumour growth in these
mice, considering the tumour suppressor properties that
the protein appears to have, such experiments would
be informative. Studies using knockout mice of ATGL,
however, have already revealed interesting insights into
cancer biology. ATGL knockout mice were shown to
be resistant to cancer cachexia indicating that complex
though poorly understood interactions exist between lipid
catabolism and tumor biology [41].

shRNAs used in this study were expressed from

then collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored

the cells were trypsinized and replated in 10-cm dishes.

from the previously described vector, pCDNA3-G0S2
[22], and ligated into the retroviral vector pBABE
including a FLAG epitope tag. Retrovirus particles were
produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with pBABE
vectors, pCL-Eco and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene plasmid #
8454). The virus-containing supernatant was collected and
stored at −80°C until further use. To establish polyclonal
cells stably expressing G0S2, HOP62 and A549 cells
were seeded and infected as described above for lentivirus
infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and drugs
A549, HOP62 and HOP92 and NB4 cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 (Wisent Inc., QC, Canada).
HT29 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (Wisent Inc., QC, Canada). All media were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone;
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 0.1% gentamicin
(Wisent Inc., QC, Canada). 1 μM ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to induce differentiation of NB4 cells. Oleic
acid-BSA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.

Apoptosis assays
Polyclonal cell populations stably expressing
shRNAs against ATGL or non-silencing control cells; or
stably expressing G0S2-Flag or Empty Vector-Flag, were
plated on 6 well plates. The cells were then treated without
vehicle; control or with 5FU (100 µM), Camptothecin
(10 µM) or Etoposide (25 µM) as indicated in the figure
legends. Drugs were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The

cells were stained by washing once with PBS and once
with AnnexinV binding buffer (2.5 mM CaCl2, 140 mM
NaCl, 7.75 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) and then incubated with
200 μl AnnexinV binding buffer containing 5 μl AnnexinV
(BD Biosciences) and 0.25 μg 7-amino-actinomycin D
(7AAD) (A.G. Scientific). The cells were analyzed on a
Cell Lab Quanta SC flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).

then percentage of distance invaded = D0-D2/D0 X 100.
For the ATGListatin experiment, the scratch was made in
a confluent HT29 cells grown on a 6 well plate. 100 µM
of ATGListatin or DMSO (control) was added to the cells
and cultured for four days.

Immunoprecipitation

Antibodies and western blotting

A polyclonal population of A549 cells stably
expressing G0S2-Flag or empty vector control (EV) were
trypsinized and washed with cold PBS. The cells were
lysed in a buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
135mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1% NP-40, 1.0 mM EDTA,
5% glycerol and protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics,
Laval, QC, Canada) on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was
pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was then
incubated with 30 μl EZview red anti-FLAG M2 affinity
gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then
pelleted and washed four times with lysis buffer. The
beads were pelleted and resuspended in 1×Laemmli
sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to immunoblotting
analysis.

Anti-FLAG M2 (Cat# F1804), tubulin (Cat#
T5168) and actin (Cat# A2066) antibodies were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. The rabbit anti-ATGL antibody
was obtained from Cayman Chemicals. Anti-p53 (DO1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. AntiBcl-XL (Cat# 2762S), Anti-AMPK (Cat# 2532) and
phospho-AMPK (Cat# 2535S) were obtained from Cell
Signaling. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against G0S2
has been described previously [44]. Whole-cell extracts
were obtained by harvesting cells and boiling in 1X
Laemmli buffer. Western blotting was performed using
standard protocols for SDS-PAGE and wet transfer onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).

Cell growth assays

Measurement of intracellular TG content

For all the proliferation assays, equal number of
cells were seeded in 12-wells plates and counted at the
indicated time points. Trypan blue was used to distinguish
live cells from dead ones. The growth curves are shown as
an average of 3-4 biological replicates.

Triglyceride accumulation was measured using a
Triglyceride Quantification Colorometric/Fluorometric
kit from BioVision Incorporated. Briefly, 10 million
cells were homogenized in a solution containing 5% NP40 in water. The samples were heated at 100 °C until
the NP-40 becomes cloudy and cooled down after to
room temperature. Another heating cycle was repeated
to solubilize all triglyceride. Samples were briefly
centrifuged to remove any insoluble material and diluted
10 fold with water before assaying. The samples were
measured using the manufactures protocol. The sample
O.D. was measured at 570nm in a microtiter plate reader.
TG concentration was calculated from a standard curve
for each assay. Data shown is normalized to total cellular
protein.

xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA)
Experiments were carried out using the
xCELLigence RTCA DP instrument (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) which was placed in a
humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Invasion
assays were performed using CIM-16 plates (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to
the manufacture protocols. 5×104 cells were seeded in
the upper chamber and each experimental condition was
performed in quadruplicate with a programmed signal
detection every five minutes over 72 hours of incubation.
Experiments measuring cytotoxicity of Atglistatin were
performed using E-plates (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacture’s
protocols. 5000 HOP62 or 4000 A549 cells undergoing
exponential growth were seeded in each well. Cell Index
value (CI) of each well was monitored every 15 min. For
drug treatment, 22 hours after seeding, cells were treated
over a period of 72 hours with the indicated concentrations
of Atglistatin (Cayman Chemical Company, MI, USA). All
data was recorded using the supplied RTCA software (vs.
1.2.1). CI-data from cell growth experiments have been

Scratch assays
HT29 cells stably expressing G0S2 shRNAs or
non-silencing control (sh-NS) were plated to create a
confluent monolayer on a 6 well plate. The monolayer
was scratched with a p200 pipet tip and the edges were
smoothed by washing the cells once with growth medium.
Cells were cultured at 37°C and time lapse photographs
taken over two days at several points in each scratch using
a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. The results are
represented as percentage of distance invaded. If width of
the scratch at day 0 = D0, width of scratch at day 2 = D2,
