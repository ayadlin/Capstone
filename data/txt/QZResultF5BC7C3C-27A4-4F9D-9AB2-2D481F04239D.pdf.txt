ABSTRACT
The roles of oncogenic miRNAs are widely recognized in many cancers. Inhibition
of single miRNA using antagomiR can efficiently knock-down a specific miRNA.
However, the effect is transient and often results in subtle phenotype, as there are
other miRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we report a multi-potent miRNA
sponge inhibiting multiple miRNAs simultaneously. As a model system, we targeted
miR-21, miR-155 and miR-221/222, known as oncogenic miRNAs in multiple tumors
including breast and pancreatic cancers. To achieve efficient knockdown, we generated
perfect and bulged-matched miRNA binding sites (MBS) and introduced multiple
copies of MBS, ranging from one to five, in the multi-potent miRNA sponge. Luciferase
reporter assay showed the multi-potent miRNA sponge efficiently inhibited 4 miRNAs
in breast and pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, a stable and inducible version of
the multi-potent miRNA sponge cell line showed the miRNA sponge efficiently reduces
the level of 4 target miRNAs and increase target protein level of these oncogenic
miRNAs. Finally, we showed the miRNA sponge sensitize cells to cancer drug and
attenuate cell migratory activity. Altogether, our study demonstrates the multi-potent
miRNA sponge is a useful tool to examine the functional impact of simultaneous
inhibition of multiple miRNAs and proposes a therapeutic potential.

construct that produces artificially designed miRNA
binding sites on the 3’UTR region of a non-toxic gene
such as GFP or luciferase. The expression of artificial
RNA with specific (and usually multiple) miRNA binding
sites can absorb endogenous miRNA (thus the name
comes in), essentially depleting the target miRNA in cells.
Although antagomiR has advantages including ease of
synthesis and diverse chemical modification to improve
its stability [12, 13], miRNA sponge can achieve stable
inhibition as well as inducible / tissue specific inhibition of
target miRNAs in vitro/vivo [14, 15]. Moreover, inserting
a number of different miRNA binding sites generates a
miRNA sponge that can simultaneously, functionally
inhibit multiple miRNAs [16]. Indeed, a report showed
the inhibition of three miRNAs using miRNA sponge
[17]. Moreover, recent papers have shown the inhibition
of multiple oncogenic miRNAs by miRNA sponges in
Ewing  sarcoma (targeting miR-106a~363 cluster) [18]

INTRODUCTION
miRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that
can inhibit protein expressions of target mRNAs, by
interacting mainly to its 3’UTR and thus degrade
mRNAs or inhibit translation [1, 2]. Increasing number
of findings demonstrated miRNAs are one of the major
regulators in gene expression [3–5], and therefore its
regulation became a great interest scientifically as well
as in translational medicine. So far, there are number
of miRNA-regulating agents being tested in clinical/
preclinical trials. These include miR-122 inhibitor
for HCV driven hepatitis [6, 7] and anti-miR-34a for
cardiovascular diseases [8].
Another miRNA regulating agents is microRNA
sponge that is initially introduced on 2007 [9]. Unlike
the antagomiR that is a complementary synthetic RNA
to the target miRNAs [10, 11], miRNA sponge is a DNA

or breast cancer (targeting miR-183/-96/-182 cluster) [19].
Because there are numerous miRNAs known to implicate
in cancer [20, 21], these results are valuable in respect
that they inhibited a number of miRNAs simultaneously.
However, three different miRNAs inhibited in their work
were a polycistronic miRNA cluster, leaving a room
for a multi-potent miRNA sponge inhibiting several
independent miRNAs. In this report, we generated a
miRNA sponge inhibiting 4 miRNAs, which are not in
a miRNA cluster. Because several miRNAs seems to
have common roles in multiple types of cancer, we aimed
to examine the effect of “driver miRNAs” inhibition
[22,  23]. We selected 4 driver miRNAs to inhibit, based
on the previous findings. The first one, miR-155, is
implicated in many physiological processes, including
differentiation and activation of various immune cells
such as T cell, B cell and dendritic cells [24, 25]. It is
also a typical oncomiR in lymphoma as well as breast,
pancreatic, lung and colon cancers [26–28]. Secondly,
miR-21 is known to play a role in heart development and
the increased level of miR-21 was detected in heart failing
conditions [29, 30]. In cancer, it is one of the well-known
oncogenic miRNA inhibiting multiple tumor suppressors
including PTEN, MSH2 and JAG1 [31–33]. miR-221 and
miR-222 are paralog, identical in the seed sequence and
are located in the same genome locus by 727bp apart
[34]. It is implicated in angiogenesis, proliferation and
cell migration. They are over-expressed in prostate, lung,
thyroid and pancreatic carcinoma [34, 35].
We report here a multi-potent miRNA sponge that
simultaneously inhibits these 4 well-known oncomiR. The
data presented here demonstrate the miRNA sponge is a
useful tool to inhibit these miRNAs simultaneously and
suggest a potential to use such tool as a therapeutic agent.

restriction enzyme site (GGGTCCC) at the end of the
monomer, thereby it can be directionally cloned. For the
efficient binding of each miRNA, the MBS sequence was
designed to be reverse complementary (Perfect) for the
matured miRNA sequences. For the MBS of miR-221
and 222, we introduced a common nucleotide sequence
(agcuacauugcucugggu) as they are identical in their seed
sequence and only 4 bases are mismatched in full miRNA
sequence. Combining with the miR-155 and miR-21
MBS, the sponge is considered to have binding sites for
4 miRNAs (miR-155, 21, 221, 222) in total.
On the other hand, we also designed MBS with
2–3  bases of mismatch (Bulged), as some of reports
suggested it can mimic physiological miRNA-target
interaction [36], thereby have better potential as a
sponge. We created bulged form by deletion of one
nucleotide and changing the remaining three nucleotides
in such a way that chance of base pairing (including
G-U wobbling) is minimal [16]. In this method, MBS
is commonly the antisense sequence of miRNA with
a central mismatch at position 9–12 of the miRNA
sequence. In our sponge, for the sequence of miR-155, it
was designed to have seed sequence of miR-155 and G-U
wobbling sequence between 10th and 12th nucleotide.
Also, base paring of the last part of the sponge and
miR-155 is minimal, which accords with the condition
of bulged sponge. In the case of miR-221 and 222,
bulged form has changed sequence at position 9–12th
nucleotide of miRNA and one nucleotide was deleted.
We used pMIR-Report vector as a backbone (Figure 1B)
because the inhibition of gene expression would be
easily measured by luciferase assay. Combining these
ideas, we were able to obtain miRNA sponges with one
to three copies of perfect matching MBS or one to five
copies of bulged MBS.

RESULTS

Effective inhibition of luciferase activity by the
3′ insertion of prefect or bulged MBS

Design and construction of the multi-potent
miRNA sponge

In order to test the luciferase-based miRNA sponge
with different numbers of MBS can inhibit miRNAs
efficiently, we transfected these sponges into MDAMB-436 breast cancer cell first and measured luciferase
activity. We used MDA-MB-436 cells based on the realtime PCR quantification results for the 4 target miRNAs in
5 cell lines, which revealed this cell line is relatively high
for the target miRNAs (Supplementary Figure 1).
Because miRNA inhibits protein expression
in general, reduction of the luciferase activity in the
sponge-transfected cells compared to the EV (empty
vector; no MBS inserted) reflects the degree of
miRNA inhibition through the MBS-miRNA binding.
Compared to the luciferase vector without MBS sites
(EV), we indeed observed dramatic decrease of the
luciferase activity when the perfect matching MBS
are present (Figure 2A). This data suggest the MBS

To determine target miRNAs, we reviewed previous
reports regarding miRNA expression and functional
analysis on breast and pancreatic cancer [27, 28, 31, 35].
We aimed to select miRNAs that showed up-regulated
expressions with oncogenic functions in both cancers. As
a result, we selected miR-155, miR-21, miR-221/222 and
the mature sequences are shown in supplementary table 2.
In order to inhibit these miRNAs simultaneously,
we designed oligonucleotide containing different
miRNA binding sites (MBS) tandemly, with a short
spacer (AATT, in Figure 1A). The unit was referred as
“monomer”. We reasoned that the spacer would reduce
non-specific binding of miRNAs and generate enough
space so several miRNAs can bind to MBS stably without
overlapping on each other [16]. The multi-potent miRNA
sponge vector was generated by introducing SanDI

sites are actively absorbing miRNAs (so the name is
sponge), resulting in the reduced expression of the
luciferase. A single copy of the perfect MBS was
enough to be efficiently knockdown the luciferase
activity, even though increased copy of MBS (2X or
3X) slightly reduced the luciferase activity further
(Figure 2A, inset). In  contrast, we observed a copy
number dependent, gradual decrease of the luciferase
activity for bulged sponge expression (Figure 2B, see
discussion). We verified these results in four other
cancer cell lines including MIA-Paca2, Panc-1, BxPC3
and MCF-7 (Figure 2C~2F). All of the four cell lines
showed efficient reduction of the luciferase activity
by the perfect or bulged MBS. Additionally, when we
over-expressed miR-155 in MCF-7 cells (with low
endogenous miR-155, supplementary Figure 1A), we
observed further reduction of the luciferase activity

(Figure 2G). This data suggest the miRNA sponge can
absorb abnormally induced miRNAs as well.

Construction of RFP-based inducible sponge and
stable cell line
Based on the results above, we next examined the
effect of the sponge on the expression and functionality
of the individual miRNA. To do this experiment, we
developed inducible, RFP (Red Fluorescence Protein)
based miRNA sponge (Figure 3A). Although the
transient transfection of the miRNA sponge vector can
produce high level of sponge, the functional analysis
is dependent on transfection efficiency. In addition,
using fluorescence protein gene as a sponge backbone
makes expression analysis easier (by microscopy)
and enables sorting of the sponge positive cells using

monomer for miR-155 (red), miR-21 (green) and miR-221/222 (blue). There is a spacer (AATT) added after each miRNA-binding site.
A SanDI linker was added at each end the sponge monomer for directional cloning. Linker (3) was designed to introduce SanDI site
into the reporter plasmid (pMIR-Report). B. Two-steps for multimeric miRNA sponge construction. First the linker was inserted through
SpeI/HindIII sites and secondly, sponge monomer was directionally ligated into the SanDI site. By changing the molar ratio of the vector
to insert, multimerized sponge vectors are generated and confirmed by sequencing.

FACS. Therefore, we introduced RFP gene instead of
luciferase at the upstream of sponge sequences. Also, we
selected an inducible promoter (Tetracycline inducible
in pcDNA5/FRT/TO/RFP) to control the expression
of the sponge in cancer cell. We introduced the same
miRNA sponge units (both perfect and bulged) into
the inducible vector to generate inducible RFP-miRNA
sponges. The constructs were then introduced into
the Flp-In TREx 293 cells. This cell line contains a
FLP locus where the sponge vector can be integrated
by the FLP recombinase, resulting in a cell line with
homogenous, inducible miRNA sponge expression
(Figure 3A). We generated two independent clonal cells
for each type of the sponge, marked as PF1/PF2 or Bg1/
Bg2 respectively. For each cell line, robust induction of
RFP by doxycycline (tetracycline analog) was detected

by fluorescence microscopy as well as western blot
analysis shown in Figure 3B and 3C.

Molecular analysis of the inducible sponge cells
reveals the multi-potent miRNA sponge inhibits
4 target miRNAs functionally
Using the inducible sponge cell line, we questioned
whether the induced miRNA sponge could inhibit all of the
4-targeted miRNAs simultaneously. To this goal, the level of
each target miRNA was measured by real-time PCR after the
induction of miRNA sponge. As shown in Figure 4A–4D,
we observed dramatic reduction of all of the four miRNAs
upon the expression of Perfect (PF) or Bulged (Bg) sponges.
To confirm the inhibitory effect of the miRNA sponge,
we made reporter plasmids having MBS for each of the

target miRNA. Relative luciferase activity was measured
after each plasmid was transfected in Flp-In TRex 293
cell where sponge was induced by doxycycline. We found
increased reporter activity for all target miRNA reporters,
showing the miRNA sponge functionally inhibits target
miRNAs (Figure 4E–4H).
As we observed stronger inhibitory effect of bulged
miRNA sponge than perfect in the inducible cells, we
compared the amount of perfect and bulged sponge
transcript loading on the miRISC complex. After inducing
the sponge by treatment of doxycycline in Flp-In TRex 293
cells, RNA immunoprecipitation with Ago2 antibody and
real-time PCR were performed. The result shows slight
but significantly more bulged sponge transcript in Ago2 IP
product, suggesting that bulged sponge was more efficiently
loaded in miRISC complex than perfect sponge (Figure 4I).
Based on this result, we next tested the expression
changes of proteins that are known to be regulated by
4 target miRNAs, after the induction of the miRNA
sponge. We selected 9 target proteins by checking
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

previous literatures and validated miRNA target database
(miRTarBase; http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw). After 48
hrs of doxycycline induction, the cells were harvested and
analyzed by western blot with antibodies recognizing each
of the protein. As shown in Figure 4J, we could observe
increased protein levels for some, not all (see discussion),
of the known targets after the induction of miRNA sponge.
That includes Bim, ER-alpha and Stat5 for miR-221/222;
SRC3, ATF2 and Bcl-2 for miR-21; C-Jun and Smad4
for miR-155. These results indicate that expression of
the multi-potent miRNA sponge up-regulates target
protein expressions by successfully inhibiting the 4 target
miRNAs.

Prediction of and validation of the target
specificity of the multi-potent miRNA sponge
As we introduced spacers and tandem repeats of
MBS in the miRNA sponge, we questioned if there is any
nonspecific miRNA interaction on the sponge constructs.

(Continued )
To answer for this, we analyzed MBS sequences in miRNA
prediction program (PITA, URL: http://genie.weizmann.
ac.il/pubs/mir07/mir07_prediction.html).
The program generates a list of miRNA candidates
in the order of the affinity on the input sequence,
determined by free energy changes by the miRNA-MBS
interaction. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, our miRNA
sponge sequence was predicted to primarily target by
the four miRNAs we aimed to inhibit. However, there
are other miRNAs following these four with possible
binding. Therefore, we decided to analyze four of
these “next-ranked” non-specific miRNAs. The results
are shown in supplementary figure 2, showing that the
level of the change for the four non-specific miRNAs
(miR-760, miR-361-5p, miR-196b and miR-485-5p in
the Tables 1 and 2)is marginal. For further assessing
specificity of the miRNA sponge, we constructed
individual reporter plasmids for these “next-ranked” nonspecific miRNAs. Luciferase reporter assay showed no
difference between the control and the sponge-induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

group, confirming that miRNA sponge did not affect
activities of these miRNAs (Supplementary Figure 3).

The multi-potent miRNA sponge sensitizes cells
to doxorubicin better than single miRNA sponge
and increases apoptosis
Because we inhibited four oncogenic miRNAs by
the sponge, we next questioned whether it ultimately
affects the oncogenecity of cancer cells. To examine this,
we treated doxycycline and doxorubicin to the inducible
miRNA sponge cell line. After 24 hrs and 48 hrs after the
doxorubicin treatment, cell proliferation was measured by
AlamarBlue assay. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, we
could find significant reduction of the cellular viability
in the miRNA sponge-induced cells. These data shows
the inhibition of miRNAs can sensitize cancer cells
to the drug. Based on this data, we then compared the
antitumor activity of the multi-potent miRNA sponge
with three other single miRNA-targeting sponges, where

miRNA. The primer sequences for reporter plasmids were shown in supplementary Table 1.
(Continued )
we introduced same copies of MBS but targeting for only
one miRNA. As a result, we observed the multi-potent
miRNA sponge inhibits cancer cell proliferation more
than the single miRNA-targeting sponges (Figure 5C). The
antitumor effect of the multi-potent miRNA sponge was
further confirmed by measuring the apoptotic population
from the drug treated cells with or without the induction of
sponge (Figure 5D–5F). We observed significant increase
of apoptotic cells after 20 hrs of doxorubicin treatment,
for both of the perfect (D) and Bulged (E) sponge induced
cells (quantified in F, with error bar). These data indicate
the expression of miRNA sponge accelerates apoptosis
induced by cancer drug.

are also involved in this process. Therefore, we tested
if the miRNA sponge can inhibit cancer cell migration.
We used transwell chamber to measure cell migration
and the results are shown in Figure 6. Both of the BxPC3
pancreatic cells (A) and MDA-MB-436 (B) breast cancer
cell showed dramatic decrease of the migration activity
by the expression of either perfect (3X) or Bulged (5X)
sponge. To gain a molecular insight for this change, we
analyzed several target proteins involved in cell migration
by western blotting and densitometry. The results in
figure 6C (for BxPC3) and 6D (for MDA-MB-436) show
1.3~2.3 fold of change in Foxo3a, PTEN and RhoA protein
level. Previous reports demonstrated that increased level
of the three proteins is associated with metastatic potential
of the cancer cells [37–39]. These data demonstrates
that the multi-potent miRNA sponge can sensitize cells
to anticancer drug and inhibit migration, suggesting the
simultaneous inhibition of multiple oncogenic miRNA can
be a therapeutic intervention for cancer.

DISCUSSION

or oncogenic, based on the previous miRNA profiling and
functional studies [26, 27, 31, 32, 34, 35].
Another important point needed to be considered for
the construction of miRNA sponge was how to determine
miRNA binding sequences (MBS) in the miRNA
sponge, as recent reports suggested mismatch on the
miRNA-inhibitor recognition can better recapitulate real
miRNA-mRNA interaction so that show more efficient
inhibition [40, 44]. To address this point, we introduced
two types of MBSs, perfect and bulged (Figure 1).
Interestingly, the capacity of miRNA sponge determined
by the reduction of the luciferase activity showed a copy
number dependent decrease of the activity for bulged
sponge (Figure 2), whereas a single copy of MBS was
enough to decrease the activity for perfect sponge. This
difference might be due to the nature of miRNA-sponge
interaction. In the bulged miRNA-sponge complex, the
interaction will be less strong than the perfect one so

There are a number of reports where miRNA sponge
targeting single miRNA was successfully used [6–8].
Similarly, miRNA sponge has been generated to inhibit
few unrelated miRNA sharing the same seed region
[40]. Although some researchers tried to inhibit several
miRNAs together, these miRNAs were generated from a
polycistronic miRNA cluster [18, 33, 41]. In this study,
we aimed to inhibit multiple (3~4) oncogenic miRNAs
simultaneously because in reality, there are more than one
miRNA that might initiate or drive tumor progression [42].
To do this, the first thing to consider is how to choose these
target miRNAs, as it is difficult to rank the importance
of miRNA without knowing its exact targets and degree
of inhibition. Additionally, each tumor can have different
repertoire of driver miRNAs [43]. Therefore, we selected 4
miRNAs that are commonly demonstrated as up-regulated

that it needs more binding sites to increase the chance of
capturing the target miRNAs.
As for the nonspecific binding of other miRNAs
to the sponge, our real-time PCR analysis showed that is
not remarkable for, at least, four top-ranked, non-specific
miRNAs (Supplementary Figure 2). However, this results
could not exclude a possibility that other miRNA still be
able to bind to the sponge. Even if it happens, we think the
binding will be much weaker than the four target miRNAs,
so that impact will be negligible.
In order to evaluate the inhibitory effect of miRNA
sponge, we tested a number of target proteins that are
reported in literatures and listed as a target protein in
MiRTarBase. We observed, however, some of the
predicted target proteins are not increased and poor target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

level increase by the Bg sponge expression (Figure 4J).
This result can be explained in several ways. First, the
target inhibition can be cell line (i.e. context) dependent.
Western blot analysis for the same proteins in MDAMB-436 cells supports that the change of target protein
could be dependent on the cell line (Supplementary
Figure 4, compared to the results in Figure 4J). Second,
there might be a range of miRNA inhibition that is
sufficient to affect certain target protein expression. If
it is true, then the critical factor, which determines the
differential target regulation, would be the availability
of the target (that is cell line dependent) and the affinity
of the miRNA to the target (target sequence dependent).
Based on this, we speculate some targets that were not
altered by the Bg miRNA sponge could be the ones

that have high affinity miRNA binding (so that it can
compete with Bg (mismatched) sponge but not with PF
sponge). If the level of such mRNA is relatively low,
then the reduction of matching miRNA expression is not
sufficient to abolish the repression of the protein level.
Further study will be needed to prove this idea.
To investigate the functional output of the multiple
miRNA inhibition, we examined cellular response to the
cancer drug (doxorubicin) and migration after expression
of the miRNA sponge. Because there are many miRNA
targets involved in various kinds of cellular processes, the
impact of the miRNA sponge can be explained in multiple
ways. For example, Foxo3a is reported to suppress EMT in
cancer cell whereas its down-regulation is known to promote
metastasis [39]. On the other hand, Foxo3a is a negative
regulator for Myc oncogene expression so the up-regulation
of Foxo3a can inhibit cell proliferation [45]. Therefore,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the up-regulation of Foxo3a by miRNA sponge results in
multiple cellular responses. Likewise, up-regulation of
PTEN can inhibit cellular migration via the suppression of
AKT pathway that will also reduce cellular proliferation as
well [46, 47]. We think that the antitumor function of our
miRNA sponge can be shown in the other assays, given that
the wide range of protein changes triggered by the inhibition
of the target miRNAs.
Even though the exact mode of action for the
multi-potent miRNA sponge is complex, we observed
functional impact of the sponge is stronger than single
miRNA targeting sponge (Figure 5C). We expect that
the functional impact of the multi-potent miRNA sponge
would be maximized not in a single type of functional
assay (like proliferation or migration) but in an in vivo
cancer model, where all of these miRNA-dependent
cancer properties are reflected in survival rate.

In summary, the present study demonstrates a multipotent miRNA sponge for a simultaneous inhibition of
multiple oncogenic miRNAs, which showed antitumor
function in cancer cells. More efforts in the development

MATERIALS AND METHODS

sponge plasmids: EV (Empty vector; pMIR-report vector),
­Perfect 1X~3X (pMIR-report vector with 1 to 3 copies of
perfect-matched sponges at 3′UTR), Bulged 1X~5X (pMIRreporter vector with 1 to 5 copies of bulge-matched sponges at 3′UTR).

Cell culture and transfection
Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-436,
MCF-7 cell lines were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and Penicillin-streptomycin (P/S).
293 Flp-In T-Rex cells were cultured with DMEM plus
10% FBS serum and P/S. Human pancreatic cancer cell
lines Panc-1 and MIA-PaCa-2 were maintained in DMEM
containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
BxPC3 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS.
For transient sponge expression, cells were transfected
­using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the following

Construction of miRNA sponge vector
We used pMIR-Report vector (Life technologies) as
a backbone. Firstly, a linker consisting of Eco0109I and
SanDI (for directional multimerization) was generated and
inserted by SpeI/HindIII sites of the vector. The primer
sequences for linker are as follows. Upper strand: 5′-PhosCTAGT AGGGCCC GGGTCCC AGGGCCC A-3′;

TTCGA-Phos-5′. After that, an oligonucleotide pair
harboring miRNA binding sites (MBS) of miR-155, miR21
and miR-221/222 with spacers (AATT) was designed and
SanDI linker was added at the each end. This monomer
unit was phosphorylated by PNK and ligated to the pMIRReport / SanDI linker vector by SanDI site. This ligation
generated monomerized as well as multimerized sponge
vectors, which were controlled by changing a ratio between
vector and insert. We generated multimerized sponge vector
by increasing the molar ratio of vector: insert up to 1:100.
The insert size was initially estimated by colony PCR with
two primers annealed to right up/downstream of the SpeI/
HindIII sites of the vector. The cloned sponge vector was
sequenced to verify the correct MBS multimerization.

has one copy of miRNA binding site for four target
miRNAs. As an internal control, 10 ng of SV40-Luc
(Renilla luciferase) per well was used. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity
was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega) and GloMax Luminometer (Promega),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Generation of inducible sponge and cell line
To generate inducible sponge, we introduced Flpin pcDNA5/FRT-RFP vector that has RFP cloned into
HindIII-XhoI sites (Generous gift from prof. SW Kang).
The perfect and bulged sponge units, which were used
in the luciferase-based sponges were inserted into the
vector by ApaI site. This construct was transfected into
Flp-In T-REx- 293 Cell and selected with hygromycin
(250 ug/ml) for 7 days. The resulting cells were tested for
sponge induction after 24 hrs of doxycycline treatment
(1 ug/ml), by checking the expression of RFP under

Luciferase assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well plate and transfected
with 150 ng of sponge or reporter plasmid DNA, which

fluorescence microscopy and western blotting. After
sponge was induced by doxycycline, the expression of
RFP was checked by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss) and
the pictures were taken at 200X magnification.

10 min on ice. Anti-pan Ago clone 2A8 (MILLIPORE)
and normal mouse IgG (oncogene) were used for RNA
immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitated RNA was
purified using RNAiso plus (TaKaRa) and the amount of
sponge RNA was measured by real-time PCR using prime
script™ RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) and Ampigene™ qPCR
Green mix Hi-Rox (Enzo life sciences), in Light Cycler
480 II (Roche).

Bioinformatics analysis for specificity prediction
We used a prediction tool from Segal Lab of
computational biology (http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/
mir07/mir07_prediction.html) as an algorithm to predict
miRNA bindings for the sponge sequences generated.
According to the prediction results, we selected four
miRNAs (other than target miRNAs) that showed highest
affinity to the sponge sequence for specificity test.

Drug sensitivity assay
Cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a density
of 15, 000 cells/well in 100 ul culture media. To express
the sponge, cells were treated with 1 ug/ml doxycycline
after 12 hrs of seeding. 1 uM Doxorubicin was added to
all cells 12 hrs after doxycycline treatment. To monitor
cell proliferation, 1/10 volume of AlamarBlue® reagent
(Invitrogen) was added directly to control and drug
treated cells after 36 hrs of the doxorubicin treatment.
The cells were incubated for an additional four hours to
measure viability, which was detected in a microplate
fluorescence spectro-photometer (GenTek) by a protocol
from the manufacturer. For the comparison of antiproliferative activity of multi-potent miRNA sponge with
single miRNA targeting sponges, MDA-MB-436 cells
were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 40000 cells/
well in 500 ul culture media. After 24 hrs, cells were
transfected with 200 ng of pMIR empty vector, perfect 2x,
bulged 2x or single miRNA sponge, which has binding
site (2X) for only one kind of target mRNA respectively.
The transfected cells were analyzed by the same way
described above.

Western blotting
Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analysis
were performed as previously described [48]. Membranes
were probed with anti-RFP (Generous gift from Dr. Sang
Wook Kang), Bim (1:1000, CST, Danvers, MA, USA),
Stat5 (1:1000, CST, Danvers, MA, USA), Smad4 (1:1000,
CST, Danvers, MA, USA), SRC3 (1:1000, CST, Danvers,
MA, USA), Cyr61 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA), ATF2 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA), c-Jun (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,
USA), Bcl-2 (1:1000, CST, Danvers, MA, USA), and
ER-alpha (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA).
As loading control, anti-beta-Actin (1:1, 000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibody was used.

miRNA real-time PCR analysis
For each sample, RNA extraction was performed
using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following
the instructions of the manufacturer. 1 ug of total
RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (Superscript FirstStrand Synthesis System; Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. For quantitative assessment of
miR-155, TRIzol-isolated RNAs were reverse transcribed
by miScript ll RT Kit and measured by miScript SYBR
Green PCR Kit in LightCycler 480 II. Cycle threshold
(Ct) values of the analyzed miRNAs were normalized to
Ct values obtained for the noncoding, small nuclear RNA
molecule U6. Data were expressed as fold change versus
control.

Annexin-V staining and FACS analysis
Flp-In T-REx293 cells were seeded in 6 well plates
at 50–60% confluence. After 24 hrs, doxorubicin (1 uM)
and doxycycline (1 ug/ml) were added to each well. After
20 hours, cells were harvested and stained according to
the protocol of FITC-Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit
(BD Pharmingen). Briefly, trypsinized cells were washed
twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 1X binding
buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 100 ul of
the solution was transferred to 1.5 ml tube. 5 ul of FITC
Annexin V and 5 ul PI were added to each tube and
incubated for 15 mins at RT in the dark. Then 400 ul of
1X binding buffer was added to each tube. Stained cells
were analyzed by using an Accuri Flow Cytometry (BD
Biosciences). The percentage of FITC-positive cells was
calculated using the CFlow software.

RNA Immunoprecipitation
Flp-In TREx 293 cells with inducible sponge
(PF or Bg) were cultured in 100 mm dish till 90%
confluence and doxycycline was treated for 24 hrs. Cells
were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 2 ml
RNA IP Lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at 7.5, 100 mM
KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitors
(Roche), RNase inhibitor (Fermentas), 10 mM DTT) for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Migration assay
Migration ability was assayed by the use of
Transwell chambers (Corning Costar) with 6.5-mm
diameter polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size). In brief,

the cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a final
concentration of 106 cells/mL, in serum free medium.
One hundred microliters of the cells’ suspension were
loaded into each of the upper wells. 10% FBS were
used as chemo-attractants in the lower chambers,
and the chamber was incubated at 37°C for 30 hours
(BxPC3) or 48 hours (MDA-MB-436). The cells were
fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were
removed by wiping them with a cotton swab, and
migration ability was measured by counting cells that
had migrated to the lower side of the filter, by using an
optical microscope (X100).
