BACKGROUND: Exploratory subgroup analyses from the phase 3 global advanced renal cell carcinoma
(ARCC) trial were conducted to determine if baseline levels of the tumor molecular markers PTEN and
HIF1 a correlated with efficacy in patients treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) versus interferon-a (IFN).
METHODS: Patients in the IFN group received 3 million U (MU) subcutaneously 3x weekly, escalating to 18
MU. Patients in the temsirolimus group received 25 mg intravenously weekly. PTEN and HIF1 a baseline levels were measured in archived tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There was no correlation between baseline PTEN and HIF1 a levels and treatment effect with respect to overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival, or objective response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
with poor-risk prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline status of the molecular markers PTEN and
HIF1 a did not correlate with efficacy in renal cell carcinoma patients treated with temsirolimus versus IFN.
Patients demonstrated OS and progression-free survival benefit when treated with temsirolimus regardless
of PTEN and HIF1 a status. Thus, baseline PTEN and HIF-1 levels may not predict response to temsirolimus.
Alternatively, the lack of correlation may be due to the variability in tumor specimens that occurred
because of the global nature of the clinical trial. Other markers in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathway may be of utility as predictors of response to temsirolimus in patients with advanced renal cell

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy
of the kidney and accounts for 2%-3% of all adult cancers.1 The 5-year survival rate for advanced renal cell carcinoma is approximately 5%-10%, and the disease is
estimated to be the cause of 13,000 deaths annually in the
United States alone.1,2 Renal cell carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease comprising several different well defined
tumors, each with a distinct histological type, a distinct
clinical course, and differential response to systemic therapy. The histologic subtypes of renal cell carcinoma
include clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, collecting
duct, and unclassified renal cell carcinoma.3
Surgery remains the standard-of-care for newly diagnosed patients with localized renal cell carcinoma but has
limited benefits to patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Historically, treatment for advanced renal
cell carcinoma has been dominated by immunotherapeutic agents such as interferon-a (IFN) and interleukin-2
(IL2).4-7 However, these agents were rarely beneficial to
patients with extensive tumor burdens and adverse prognostic risk factors.8-10
Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular origins and pathways of renal cell carcinoma have led
to the development of more effective targeted therapies.
Currently, 3 novel agents, sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus, have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in advanced renal cell carcinoma.
Sorafenib and sunitinib are both multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3) with antitumor and antiangiogenic activity.11-14 In a randomized
phase 3 trial of untreated patients, sunitinib showed
improved progression-free survival and objective response
rates (ORR) when compared with IFN.15,16 In a randomized phase 3 trial of sorafenib versus placebo, in cytokine
refractory patients, improved progression-free survival
was demonstrated for the sorafenib group when compared
with the placebo group.17
Temsirolimus is a selective inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase positioned at the juncture of several
signal transduction pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that is frequently disrupted in cancer (Fig. 1).18,19 Mechanisms for activation
of the PI3K/Akt pathway include loss of tumor suppressor
PTEN function, amplification or mutation of PI3K or
Akt, or activation of growth factor receptors. Once the
3652

pathway is activated, signaling through Akt can be propagated to a diverse array of substrates, including mTOR.
mTOR exists in 2 distinct multiprotein complexes, 1 that
is sensitive to rapamycin and 1 that is not. The rapamycin-sensitive complex (mTORC1) contains mTOR,
PRAS40, MLST8, and raptor (scaffold), and this complex
is responsible for many of the activities associated with
mTOR.20,21 Once mTOR is activated it directly phosphorylates ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (p70S6K), which,
in turn, phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein
(S6RP).22 mTORC1 also indirectly regulates the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E by phosphorylating its inhibitory partner 4E-BP1, causing it to release eIF-4E. The
release of eIF-4E and phosphorylation of S6RP leads to
increased translation of tumor-promoting proteins such
as D-cyclins, c-Myc, HIF1 a, HIF2 a, and VEGF.
Temsirolimus binds to FK506-binding protein 12
(FKBP12) and the protein-drug complex inhibits the kinase activity of mTOR.23 This abrogates the mTORmediated translation of tumor-promoting proteins. Temsirolimus has antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities.24-27 In a pivotal phase 3 global ARCC trial,
temsirolimus was compared with IFN and demonstrated
longer overall survival (OS; median 10.9 months for temsirolimus vs median 7.3 months for IFN, P ¼ .008) and
progression-free survival (investigator assessment: median
3.8 months for temsirolimus vs median 1.9 months for
IFN, P < .001).28
Historically, clinical factors have been used as prognostic markers for patients with renal cell carcinoma.
However, recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis and molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma have
led to the investigation of molecular tumor markers that
may enhance earlier diagnosis and, more accurately, predict tumor prognosis and response to treatment, thus
improving survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma.
Weiss et al demonstrated in 396 patients with localized
and metastatic renal cell carcinoma that the level of p21
expression and its immunostaining patterns correlated
with tumor type and grade.29 Markers of tumor proliferation, such as Ki67, have also been correlated with survival
in papillary renal cell carcinoma.30 Expression of p27Kip1
(cell cycle inhibitor) has been correlated with a significantly decreased disease-specific survival interval in clear
cell renal cell carcinoma.31,32 The angiogenic factor
VEGF was found to be an independent prognostic factor

(mTOR) pathway and mechanism of action of inhibitors.34 In this diagram, arrows pointing downward or curved arrows pointing
to the right indicate activation, whereas curved arrows pointing left or lines ending in crossbars indicate inhibition. mTOR, a
member of the phosphoinositide-kinase-related kinase family, is a central component of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which
mediates eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation and is aberrantly regulated in cancer. The mTOR kinase is the catalytic component of 2 distinct multiprotein complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains mTOR, raptor (scaffold), MLST8, and
PRAS40 (repressor), and the complex is responsible for many of the activities associated with mTOR. PTEN, a tumor suppressor,
is a phosphatase that reverses the action of PI3K. Inactive Akt is recruited to the cell membrane by products of PI3K and, when
activated, promotes mTORC1 activity by phosphorylation of certain components. Active mTORC1 phosphorylates p70S6K (activation) and 4EBP-1 (inhibition of negative regulator) to increase mRNA translation of specific tumor promoting proteins, such as
D-type cyclins and c-Myc, which increase cell proliferation, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1 a), a transcription factor that
regulates synthesis of the proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and of various glycolytic enzymes
and growth factors that can promote cell survival. Temsirolimus inhibits mTORC1 by binding first to the intracellular protein
FKBP12; the resultant temsirolimus-FKBP12 complex then binds mTOR to inhibit mTORC1 activity and, thereby, abrogates production of tumor promoting proteins. Activation or inhibition induced by direct phosphorylation at 1 or more sites is indicated by a
phosphate (P).

for progression-free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who were treated with sorafenib in the
phase 3 TARGET trial.33 Patients with high or low baseline levels of VEGF who were treated with sorafenib had
longer progression-free survival than those with similar
levels who were treated with placebo (P < .01 for both
high and low levels of VEGF).
Because PTEN and pAKT are key regulators of
mTOR and HIF1 a is a key downstream target or consequence of mTOR activation and an important determinant of angiogenesis, we report on the correlation
between these tumor molecular markers of the PI3K/Akt
pathway with efficacy in patients treated with temsirolimus versus IFN in the phase 3 ARCC trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Methods
Trial design

This was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, outpatient study comparing IFN alone with temsirolimus
alone, and temsirolimus in combination with IFN in
patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma and at least 3 of 6 protocol-specified prognostic
risk factors. Detailed methods of this study were published previously28 and only general information will be
presented here.
Patients

Patients were eligible if they had histologically or
cytologically confirmed advanced renal cell carcinoma
(stage IV or locally recurrent, unresectable disease), a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or more, and no previous
systemic therapy. Additional eligibility criteria included
tumors that were measurable according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and
adequate bone marrow and organ functions. Patients had
at least 3 of the following 6 prognostic risk factors: 1) less
than 1 year from time of initial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis to randomization; 2) Karnofsky performance status
of 60 or 70; 3) hemoglobin level less than the lower limit
of the normal range; 4) corrected serum calcium level
>10 mg/dL; 5) serum lactate dehydrogenase level >1.5
times the upper limit of the normal range; and 6) more
than 1 metastatic organ site.
3654

The Institutional Review Boards of the participating
institutions approved the study protocol, and all patients
gave written informed consent. This study was conducted
according to the international standards of Good Clinical
Practice.
Treatment

The IFN group received IFNa-2a (Roferon-A,
Roche) at a starting dose of 3 million U (MU) administered subcutaneously 3 times per week for the first week.
This was increased to 9 MU 3 times per week for the second week and to 18 MU 3 times per week for the third
week, provided that this dose was tolerated.
The temsirolimus group received 25 mg temsirolimus (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) weekly administered by
30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. Treatment was continued as long as there was no disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, or intolerable adverse events. The
combination study arm received 15 mg temsirolimus
administered IV once weekly plus 6 MU of IFN 3 times
weekly. Only the single-drug study arms were evaluated in
this exploratory analysis of PTEN and HIF1 a as molecular markers.
Study evaluation

Investigators were requested (but not required per
protocol) to collect tumor tissue samples for each patient
at screening. Surgical specimens were collected from
patients who had nephrectomies, and core biopsy samples
were collected from patients who had not undergone
nephrectomies. Paraffin blocks or slides cut from blocks
were shipped to an independent vendor (Ventana Medical
Systems Inc.) for immunohistochemical evaluation. The
central pathologist reviewed hematoxylin and eosin stains
performed on all tissues before immunohistochemistry to
verify tissue integrity, presence of tumor cells, and cellular
viability. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on the
BenchMark XT and Discovery XT staining platforms
(Ventana Medical Systems Inc.). An antibody to vimentin
was used to assess specimen quality, either antibody diluent or rabbit immunoglobulin was used as negative controls, and an antibody to Ki-67 (VMSI, #790-2910) was
used to verify system performance in this study.
HIF1 a levels were assessed by mouse monoclonal
antibody (#610959, clone 54, BD/Pharmingen), HIF2 a
by a mouse monoclonal antibody (#NB100-132, clone

(#9559, clone 138G6, Cell Signaling Technologies).
Staining intensity was measured on a semiquantitative scale of 0 to 3. A staining intensity of 0 indicated nondetectable levels of molecular marker and the sample’s
molecular marker status was, therefore, designated negative. A staining intensity >0 indicated detectable levels of
molecular marker and the sample was, therefore, designated positive.
This scale was developed by consensus among Ventana’s pathologists at a prescoring training session where
they were blinded to specimen details but were aware of
the marker. Stained slides were evaluated by 2 pathologists
independently and any scoring discrepancies were
resolved by having the pathologists read jointly.
Histology of patients was recorded at screening.
Investigators were asked to record primary cell type of tumor samples obtained from first diagnosis as clear or other
(nonclear or indeterminate). Papillary, chromophobe,
and collecting duct subtypes, though recorded for
patients, were not analyzed as independent variables in
the correlation between renal cell carcinoma histology and
tumor molecular marker status, given the small numbers
of each specific subtype present.

Statistical analyses

All analyses were exploratory. All P values were
nominal and no adjustments for multiple testing were
employed. For each molecular marker type (PTEN or
HIF1 a), the Cox proportional hazards model was used to
test for interaction between treatment and molecular
marker status for OS and progression-free survival (investigator-based data and independent radiologist-based
data). Within each biomarker subgroup, the KaplanMeier method was used to estimate median time to event
and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio comparing the temsirolimus group
to the IFN group.
For ORR, logistic regression was used to examine
interaction between treatment and molecular marker status and Fisher exact test was used to compare ORR
between treatment groups within each biomarker
subgroup.

RESULTS
Characterization of Patients by Baseline
Molecular Marker Status
The pAkt epitope was labile, and so appropriate membrane staining in archival paraffin-embedded specimens
was rarely observed. Thus, pAkt status was not analyzed
for correlation with efficacy. HIF2 a was expressed in
most of the tumors in the study population but expression
was often heterogeneous, which precluded further
analysis.
Of the 416 patients in the intent-to-treat population
for the temsirolimus and IFN single study arms, tumor
PTEN levels were available for 51% of patients and HIF1 a levels were available for 60% of patients (Table 1). Of
patients with PTEN data, 71% had tumors that stained
positively (scoring intensity >0). Of patients with HIF1 a
data, 62% had tumors that stained negatively (scoring intensity ¼ 0) for HIF1 a. The distribution of molecular
marker status was balanced across the treatment study
arms; P value (chi-square test) for comparison of temsirolimus versus IFN for PTEN was .7791 and for HIF1 a
was .0866. The baseline characteristics within the molecular marker groups were also well balanced across the treatment study arms for most covariates except that a larger
percentage of patients in the temsirolimus study arm had
prior nephrectomy than those in the IFN study arm in
PTEN positive and HIF1 a positive subgroups (PTEN:
83% vs 65%, HIF1 a: 60.5% vs 43%).
Overall Survival by PTEN and HIF1 a Status
Patients treated with temsirolimus showed a trend in OS
benefit regardless of whether their tumors were positive or
negative for PTEN or HIF1 a. Patients treated with temsirolimus whose tumors were PTEN positive had a median OS of 11.3 months, while patients treated with IFN
whose tumors were PTEN positive had a median OS of
7.1 months (Table 2). Patients treated with temsirolimus
whose tumors were PTEN negative had a median OS of
10.7 months, while patients treated with IFN whose
tumors were PTEN negative had a median OS of 8.3
months.
HIF1 a negative patients treated with temsirolimus
had median OS of 10.7 months and patients treated with
IFN had median OS of 7.2 months. HIF1 a positive

Correlation of PTEN and HIF1 a Status with
Renal Cell Carcinoma Histology

Patients showed a trend in progression-free survival benefit when treated with temsirolimus regardless of molecular
marker status. PTEN positive patients treated with temsirolimus had longer median progression-free survival (investigator assessments) of 3.7 months than PTEN positive
patients treated with IFN who had median progressionfree survival of 2.0 months (Table 3). PTEN negative
patients treated with temsirolimus had longer median
progression-free survival of 3.7 months versus PTEN negative patients treated with IFN who had median progression-free survival of 1.9 months. HIF1 a negative patients
treated with temsirolimus had median progression-free
survival (investigator assessment) of 3.6 months versus
HIF1 a negative patients treated with IFN who had
shorter median progression-free survival of 1.9 months.
The median progression-free survival for HIF1 a positive
patients treated with temsirolimus was 4.4 months, and
the median progression-free survival for HIF1 a positive
patients treated with IFN was 2.3 months. The results for
correlation of biomarkers with independent assessment of
progression-free survival were similar to that of investigator assessed progression-free survival.

There was also no correlation (Table 5, P ¼ .9933)
between baseline PTEN status and clear cell and other renal cell carcinoma histologies (includes nonclear renal cell
carcinoma and indeterminate histology as identified by
the individual sites). A higher percentage of patients were
HIF1 a positive among clear cell patients than among
patients of other histologies (41% vs 22%).

The ORR (complete þ partial response) for temsirolimus
was not significantly higher than that for IFN in any of
the biomarker subgroups (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In this study, pAkt and HIF2 a were identified as tumor
molecular markers for investigation in patients with
advanced renal cell carcinoma but could not be analyzed
successfully. The lability of the pAkt epitope and the lack
of specialized preparation of archived tumor specimens
for phosphoprotein analysis precluded further investigation of pAkt. The expression of HIF2 a was markedly heterogeneous in the study population, resulting in poor
quality data.
HIF1 a data were available for 60% of patients and
PTEN data were available for 51% of patients in the single-treatment study arms. The discrepancy in the

percentage of patients available for PTEN assessment
(51%) versus HI-1a (60%) was due to limited tissue availability ie, multiple immunohistochemical assays resulted
in depletion of tumor specimens, so all assays could not be
performed.
The distribution of tumor molecular marker status
and the baseline characteristics of patients within the molecular marker groups were well balanced for most of the
covariates listed in Table 1.
There was no correlation between baseline PTEN or
HIF1 a status and treatment effect with respect to OS and
progression-free survival or ORR (both investigator and
independent assessments) in patients with advanced renal
cell carcinoma and poor-risk prognostic factors. Patients
3658

demonstrated OS and progression-free survival benefit
when treated with temsirolimus regardless of PTEN or
HIF1 a status. ORR was similar for temsirolimus and
IFN in all of the PTEN and HIF1 a subgroups. Thus,
results from this study suggest that baseline PTEN and
HIF-1 levels may not predict response to temsirolimus in
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and poor
prognostic features. By contrast, Pantuck et al found
PTEN to be an independent prognostic factor of diseasespecific survival time; but, in their study, patients were
not treated with a targeted agent but were either untreated
or treated with cytokines.32
The quality of the tissue samples may have some
bearing on the lack of correlation between PTEN and
HIF1 a status and efficacy of temsirolimus in patients
with renal cell carcinoma. Variation in sample quality
may have arisen because of the global nature of the trial
where different sites were responsible for preparation,
handling, and storage of the tumor samples. This variability demonstrates the intrinsic challenges in assessing tumor molecular markers in global clinical trials. Also,
biopsies were not performed in a controlled setting; ie,
they were not required per protocol.
For phase 3 trials, there is clearly a need to improve
tissue collection methods. Ideally, standardized collections of fresh tissue specimens would be best, but it would
require prompt attention at surgery or biopsy, immediate
access to -80 C facilities at all participating sites, strict
coding, and transport in vapor or liquid nitrogen to a centralized facility. Limiting analyses to paraffin-embedded

samples limits the type of molecular marker analyses. But
even if 1 could mandate the collection of fresh tissue in
these molecular marker studies, it will be difficult to mandate a minimum size of tissue and to determine the minimum distance from areas of necrosis needed to perform
analysis.
There was no correlation between PTEN status and
clear cell versus other renal cell carcinoma histologies, but
there was correlation between HIF1 a status and histology. It is possible that for some histologic subtypes of renal cell carcinoma, analysis of certain biomarkers might
suggest a correlation, but greater numbers of patients enrolled with the different individual histologies are needed
to confirm the result of this analysis.
It is important to note that these exploratory molecular marker analyses pertain to the patients described
herein and may not apply to patients who are categorized
by different risk stratification, ie, patients with less aggressive disease or lower tumor burden.
It is also highly possible that other markers in the
PI3K/Akt pathway may be of utility as predictors of
response to temsirolimus in patients with advanced renal
cell carcinoma. Good potential candidates are downstream targets, such as S6RP, or more upstream targets,
such as PI3K, Akt, and phospho-mTOR. Pantuck et al
identified cytoplasmic Akt and S6RP as independent
prognostic factors of disease-specific survival time in
patients with renal cell carcinoma who were treated by
nephrectomy.32
Molecular markers have the potential to enhance
our ability to predict the response of an individual tumor
to treatment and to stratify patients into more appropriate
risk groups, enabling the move from nonspecific treatments to specific treatments of targeted therapies for
enriched patient populations. Therefore, molecular
marker studies similar to the 1 described in this study
should continue to be pursued during clinical trials.
