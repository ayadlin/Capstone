biomarkers are areas of intense investigation, and may permit
rational combination therapies using targeted therapy and antiapoptotic inhibitors. The reward of successful cancer cell killing
will, it is hoped, lead to improved outcomes for our patients.

Comprehensive genomic analyses, such as genome
sequencing, transcriptome analyses and functional screens, have
identified oncogenic ‘driver’ mutations in a variety of cancers
[1]. Correspondingly, small molecule inhibitors targeting
these mutant oncoproteins have demonstrated promise in the
clinic. However, most, if not all, targeted therapies usually
fail to eradicate disease. The most likely explanations are
either insufficient inhibition of the driver oncoprotein or the
existence of genetic or epigenetic alterations in cancer cells that
limit the effectiveness of targeted therapy. Overcoming such
intrinsic resistance of cancer cells may therefore improve the
efficacy of targeted therapy. In melanoma, the most common
targetable genetic alteration is oncogenic activation of the
protein kinase BRAF, leading to its constitutive activity and
downstream MAPK signaling [2, 3]. Vemurafenib, an ATPcompetitive BRAF inhibitor has been approved for use in
patients and improves overall survival compared to standard of
care chemotherapy. Similar to many other targeted therapies,
it prolongs survival only on average several months compared
to chemotherapy. We recently identified a lineage-specific
anti-apoptotic factor, BCL2A1, that is recurrently amplified in
approximately one third of human melanomas [4]. BCL2A1 is
a member of the five-gene anti-apoptotic BCL2 family, each
which has been shown to be dysregulated in several cancer
types [5]. We reported that BCL2A1 expression is restricted to
the melanocyte lineage by virtue of its direct regulation by the
melanocyte master regulator and melanoma oncogene, MITF.
We also showed that the apoptotic response to BRAF inhibitors
could be significantly enhanced by suppression of BCL2A1.
Importantly, a small molecule called obatoclax, which inhibits
BCL2 family members including Bcl2A1, enhanced the efficacy
of BRAF inhibitors in vitro and in mouse models. Together with
other reports in colon cancer or hematologic malignancies [6],
these data indicate that combinations of targeted therapy along
with small molecule inhibitors of the anti-apopototic family
may have synergistic clinical utility. In addition to obatoclax,
small molecule antagonists of BCL2 family members such as
navitoclax (ABT-737) and ABT-199, as well as others are in
clinical development [7, 8]. Though evaluation of navitoclax
has been subject to study in some cancer types, these drugs
inhibit Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but not Bcl2A1 or Mcl1. Moreover
high levels of BCL2A1 and MCL1 are typically associated with
resistance to such agents [9]. Thus, treatment of patients with
anti-apoptotic drug combinations will need to be individualized
depending on the key apoptotic proteins that are dysregulated
in each tumor.
Since the BCL-2 family can be regulated by targeted
therapy and chemotherapy, it is likely that dynamic changes
in their expression and interactions with other BCL-2 family
members will necessitate innovative approaches to develop
reliable biomarkers. The development and validation of such
