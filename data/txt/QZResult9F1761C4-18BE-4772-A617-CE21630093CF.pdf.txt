ABSTRACT
Chronic fibrosis is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). The pathological progression of hepatic fibrosis has been linked to
cellular processes that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Several recent studies
have highlighted the cross-talk between tumor cells and activated hepatic stellate
cells (aHSCs) in HCC. The herbal compound Songyou Yin (SYY) is known to attenuate
hepatoma cell invasion and metastasis via down-regulation of cytokine secretion by
aHSCs. However the underlying mechanism of SYY treatment in reversal of hepatic
fibrosis and metastasis of liver cancers is not known. In the current study, a nude
mouse model with liver fibrosis bearing orthotopic xenograft was established and we
found that SYY could reduce associated fibrosis, inhibit tumor growth and improve
survival. In the subcutaneous tumor model with fibrosis, we found that SYY could
inhibit liver cancer. In vitro, hepatoma cells incubated with conditioned media (CM)
from SYY treated aHSCs showed reduced proliferation, decrease in colony formation
and invasive potential. SYY treated group showed altered gene expression, with 1205
genes up-regulated and 1323 genes down-regulated. Gene cluster analysis indicated
that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was one of the key genes altered in the
expression profiles. PI3K related markers were all significantly down-regulated. ELISA
also indicated decreased secretion of cytokines which were regulated by PI3K/AKT
signaling after SYY treatment in the hepatic stellate cell line, LX2. These data clearly
demonstrate that SYY therapy inhibits HCC invasive and metastatic potential and
improves survival in nude mice models with chronic fibrosis background via inhibition
of cytokine secretion by activated hepatic stellate cells.

followed by concomitant liver cirrhosis is the predominant
risk factor for the development of HCC [2]. A previous
study has demonstrated that activated hepatic stellate
cells (aHSCs) play a key role in causing liver cirrhosis
and infiltration into the HCC stroma, which supports
malignancy progression [3].

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer (mainly hepatocellular carcinoma
[HCC]), ranks as the fifth most common cancer and
worldwide it is the second most frequent cause of death
in men [1]. In China, it is observed that chronic hepatitis

Some reports have shown that in response to liver
damage from viruses, alcohol, drug abuse and any other
cause, the aHSCs trans-differentiate into myofibroblasts
(MFs), which leads to hepatic fibrosis or even cirrhosis
[4, 5]. Several recent studies have indicated that cross-talk
occurs between tumor cells and aHSCs during progression
of HCC [6, 7]. Wang and colleagues [8] reported that cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from lung cancer
tissue produces hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which
activates the c-Met pathway resulting in the invasion and
metastasis of cancer cells [9]. Another study reported that
fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissue enhances cancer
cell invasiveness through an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent
signaling mechanism [10]. Thus, there is evidence to support
the concept that aHSCs contribute to the development and
progression of different types of malignancies. Similarly,
aHSCs enhance hepatoma cell invasiveness and metastasis
through paracrine signaling mechanisms involving cytokine
secretion [11, 12]. Furthermore, the transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β) receptor inhibitor, LY2109761, was shown
to inhibit the production of TGF-β secretion by CAFs,
which blocked the cross-talk between CAFs and HCC and
inhibited progression of HCC [13]. Supported by these
previous studies, aHSCs are recognized critical players in
the development and progression of malignancy [14, 15].
Inhibition of aHSC activity in the tumor microenvironment
represents a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent and
treat HCC.
Since ancient times, herbal medicines have been
used in China to treat different malignancies. [16]. Several
studies have shown that extracts from traditional herbal
medicines possess anticancer potential, warranting further
study. These studies have shown that herbal extracts
possess anticancer activity and can modulate cell cycle,
apoptotic signaling, expression of angiogenic factors,
invasion and metastatic potential in cancer cells [17–27].
The herbal medicine Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi Tang is a mixture
of ten herbs, and was shown to suppress the growth of
hepatoma cells in vitro through the activation of a p53independent pro-apoptotic signaling mechanism [28].
Similarly, Sho-Saiko-To, which is a mixture of seven
herbs, inhibited the proliferation of human hepatoma
cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [29]. Our
recent study with Songyou Yin (SYY), a mixture of five
herbs, showed inhibition of HCC growth and prolonged
survival in a mice model by inducing caspase-3-dependent
tumor cell apoptosis [30]. We also demonstrated that
SYY inhibited HCC invasiveness by down-regulation
of enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) [30].
Xiong et al., found that SYY could attenuate oxaliplatinenhanced HCC metastatic potential [31]. Jia et al.,
reported that SYY attenuated hepatoma cell invasiveness
and metastasis in vitro via down-regulation of cytokines
secreted by aHSCs [11]. However, whether SYY has
a role in reversal of hepatic fibrosis and which signal
transduction pathway leads to inhibition of hepatoma
progression remains largely unknown.

In the present study, a mouse model with a fibrotic
background was established to determine if SYY could
attenuate hepatic fibrosis and block the cross-talk between
aHSCs and HCC in xenograft tumors. We also investigated
the ability of SYY to indirectly influence the malignancy
potential and progression of hepatoma cells and the
molecular mechanisms involved.

RESULTS
Establishment of a nude mouse model
with fibrosis
In order to study the correlation between liver
fibrosis and HCC, it is important to establish a stable
mouse model with fibrosis. We utilized the method of
subcutaneous injection of CCl4 and found, as expected, that
the severity of hepatic fibrosis increased with the prolonged
treatment of CCl4. The liver stiffness, the particles on the
liver surface and volume are three of the important exterior
characteristics in evaluating liver cirrhosis. We found the
severity of hepatic fibrosis was increased by exhibiting
the increased particles on the liver surface, and there
was reduced liver volume with the prolonged treatment
of CCl4 (Figure 1A). H&E and Sirius staining showed
there was continuous collagen accumulation induced by
prolonged CCl4 treatment (Figure 1B, 1C). α-SMA, which
is a marker of hepatic fibrosis, was also up-regulated after
CCl4 treatment (Figure 1D).

SYY inhibited tumor growth and reduced
associated fibrosis in nude mice bearing
orthotopic xenografts with a fibrosis
background
Based on the nude mouse model with fibrosis
mentioned above, we further established the nude mouse
model bearing orthotopic xenograft with fibrosis. These
were divided in untreated and SYY treated groups.
There was enhanced proliferation in the untreated
group (HCCLM3 + CCl4 2.418 ± 0.24 vs. HCCLM3
1.748 ± 0.15, P = 0.0448). SYY (2 g/kg/day) exhibited
no significant inhibition of tumor growth (HCCLM3, 1.74
8 ± 0.15 vs. HCCLM3 + SYY 1.736 ± 0.13, P = 0.9514),
while, in the treated group induced by CCl4, the same
dosage of SYY showed a significant inhibition of tumor
growth (HCCLM3 + CCl4 2.418 ± 0.2376 vs. HCCLM3 +
CCl4 + SYY 1.584 ± 0.1725, P = 0.0218) (Figure 2A).
H&E and Sirius staining highlighted the increased
fibrous connective tissue in tumor stroma induced by
CCl4 (Figure 2B, 2C). The expression of α-SMA, also
increased (HCCLM3 1259 ± 112.2 vs. HCCLM3 + CCl4
12180 ± 1073, P = 0.0006) in untreated group, but was
down-regulated in SYY treated group (HCCLM3 + CCl4
12180 ± 1073 vs. HCCLM3 + CCl4 + SYY 7327 ± 476.3,
P = 0.0144) (Figure 2D).

which is a marker of proliferation, was down-regulated
in tumor tissues in SYY treated group (HCCLM3 +
HSC 22880 ± 1510 vs. HCCLM3 + HSC + SYY 15240

down-regulated after treatment with SYY in the LM3
and HSC mixed tissues (HCCLM3 + HSC 25830 ± 1269
vs. HCCLM3 + HSC + SYY 14910 ± 1057, P = 0.0027)
(Figure 3D). H&E and Sirius staining indicated reduced
fibrous tissue and collagen accumulation in tumor tissues
after SYY treatment (Figure 3E). Finally, in aHSCs,
α-SMA was significantly decreased as demonstrated
by immunofluorescence (red staining) (Figure 3F).
Meanwhile, the SYY treatment group in the xenograft
model showed that hepatic cancer cells were attenuated in
metastasizing to the lungs (HCCLM3 + HSC 7.0 ± 1.0 vs.

The nude mouse xenograft model with a fibrosis
background was established and the correlation between
tumor parenchymal cells and aHSCs was evaluated. The
HCCLM3 cell density of 5 × 104 and 1 x105 could not
form xenograft tumors. Even with the total number of cells
approaching 5 × 105, only half of the xenograft tumors
were formed. While HCCLM3 with cell density of 1 × 106
could form full xenograft tumors (Figure 3A, Table 1).
The mixture of 5 × 104 HCCLM3 and 1 × 105 aHSCs,
formed xenograft tumors. The volume of the xenograft
tumors were related to the number of HCCLM3 cells
used (Figure 3B, Table 1). For further studies, mixture
of 5 × 105 HCCLM3 cells and 5 × 105 aHSCs cells was
used to form xenograft tumors. There was significant

to prolonged survival (HCCLM3 + HSC 51.33 ± 5.26 days
vs. HCCLM3 + HSC + SYY 63.17 ±  9.22  days,
P = 0.0016) (Figure 4).

SYY  showed no direct inhibition on the clonogenic
capacity of HCCLM3 and Hep3B (HCCLM3 1.853

Hep3B 2.100 ± 0.0547 vs. Hep3B + SYY 2.300 ± 0.0512,
P =0.0705). However, the CM from SYY treated aHSCs
significantly inhibited the clonogenic capacity of LM3
and Hep3B (HCCLM3 + CM-SYY 4.400 ± 0.1155 vs.
HCCLM3 + CM-nSYY 1.127 ± 0.0636, P < 0.0001;

1.400 ± 0.0577, P < 0.0001) (Figure 5A). The number of
HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells passing through the basement
membrane was increased after treatment with CM obtained
from aHSCs (HCCLM3 31.00 ± 1.528 vs. HCCLM3 + CMnSYY 67.3 3± 1.764, P < 0.0001; Hep3B 46.67 ± 1.764
vs. Hep3B + CM-nSYY 84.00 ± 3.215, P = 0.0005).
SYY showed no direct inhibition on the number of
HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells passing through the basement

Hepatoma cells treated with CM from SYY
pretreated aHSCs showed reduced malignant
potential
While studying the basic characteristics of SYY,
we found that SYY exhibited concentration-dependent
inhibition. Hence we chose SYY (8 mg/ml) as the final
concentration for further experiments, which exhibited
no significant cytotoxicity in LX2 (Supplementary
materials 1). The clonogenic capacity of HCCLM3 and
Hep3B was enhanced after treatment with aHSCs CM
(HCCLM3 1.853 ± 0.0867 vs. HCCLM3 + CM-nSYY

Figure 3: Subcutaneous tumor model of liver cancer was established and the correlation among tumor parenchymal
cells, aHSCs in the stroma and SYY were investigated. LM3 in the range of 5 × 104 to 1 × 105 cells did not form tumors, and even

with the total number of cells approaching 5 × 105 only half of the amount of tumors were formed A. LM3 in the number of 5 × 104 can form
tumors when added with 1 × 105 aHSCs. The volumes of tumors were related to the number of LM3 cells B. Thus, 5 × 105 LM3 cells with
5 × 105 aHSCs were chosen to form tumors and the tumor volume was significantly reduced after treatment with SYY C. PCNA and α-SMA
were both down-regulated in tumor tissues after treatment with SYY D. HE and Sirius staining exhibited reduced fibrous connective tissue
and collagen accumulation in tumor tissues after treatment with SYY E. Finally, aHSCs, which were marked by α-SMA, were significantly
decreased, as evident by immunofluroescence F.

the CM from SYY treated aHSCs significantly inhibited
the number of HCCLM3 and Hep3B migrating cells

The cell proliferation of HCCLM3 and Hep3B was
enhanced after treatment with CM from aHSCs (HCCLM3

induce changes in the hepatic tumor phenotype [34, 35].
A recent study has reported that aHSCs interact with
hepatoma cells via secretion of cytokines, extracellular
matrix (ECM)-mediated interactions and direct cell-to-cell
contacts [36]. We previously reported that SYY indirectly
attenuated hepatoma cell invasiveness and pulmonary
metastasis through down-regulation of cytokines secreted
by aHSCs [11]. However, the ability of SYY to reverse
liver fibrosis and mechanisms regulating HCC inhibition
remains largely unknown. Therefore, we chose a mouse
model with a cirrhosis background to determine if SYY
could attenuate hepatic fibrosis, block the cross-talk
between aHSCs and HCC and indirectly influence the
malignant potential of hepatoma cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Accumulating evidence supports the concept
that aHSCs are the main matrix-producing cells in the
process of liver fibrosis in response to liver damage [4, 5].
Numerous studies have shown that aHSCs up-regulate the
gene expression of ECM components, matrix-degrading
enzymes and respective inhibitors, resulting in ECM
remodeling and accumulation [37]. In the present study,
we established a stable mouse model with a fibrosis
background using chronic subcutaneous injection of CCL4.
We found that the severity of hepatic fibrosis was increased
by enhancing particles on the liver surface, and there was
liver volume with the prolonged treatment of CCL4. As
expected, H&E and Sirius staining showed continuous
collagen accumulation following CCL4 treatment. We also

observed up-regulated α-SMA expression following CCL4
treatment. An increasingly complex interplay between
various cell types of the liver, stellate cells with tumor
cells had now become apparent. [38, 39]. Therefore, based
on the previous reports regarding nude mouse model with
fibrosis as mentioned above, we further established a
similar model bearing orthotopic xenograft in mice with
fibrosis background.
The development of distant metastasis requires the
invasion of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the
surrounding tissue. To acquire such invasive abilities,
cancer cells must undergo several phenotypic changes.
aHSCs, is one of the most important members in the
tumor microenvironment, which plays a critical role in
modulating such phenotypic changes. Amann et al., [12]
demonstrated that conditioned medium (CM) collected
from aHSCs could promote proliferation and migration of
HCC cells. There are many cytokines secreted by aHSCs
that are associated with tumor invasion and metastasis,
including HGF, EGF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-9,
TGF-β, TNF-α, VEGF and members of the Wnt signaling
family [9, 39, 40]. Studebaker et al., [10] found soluble
IL-6 produced by tissue-specific fibroblasts could promote
growth and invasion of breast cancer cells, which could
be inhibited by the removal or inhibition of IL-6. Li et al.,
[41] found that Wnt2, secreted by tumor fibroblasts,
promoted tumor progression in oesophageal cancer
by activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Recently, Jia et al., [11], found that SYY could attenuate
hepatic cancer cell’s invasive and metastatic capabilities
by down-regulating cytokines secreted by aHSCs such as
HGF, IL-6, TGF-β and VEGF in vitro. In the present study,
we found that SYY could have an effect on fibrosis and
also could block the cross-talk between aHSCs and HCC.
SYY is a Chinese herbal medicine consisting of
five herbs. Some components of SYY, such as Tanshinone
and Astragalussaponins, have demonstrated efficacy in
treatment of malignancies [42, 43]. We have previously
shown that SYY could effectively inhibit tumor growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and metastasis, reverse the molecular changes consistent
with endothelial to mesenchymal transition and increase
survival in a HCC nude mouse model [30,  31]. In the
present study, SYY inhibited liver cancer, reduced
associated fibrosis and prolonged survival in the
subcutaneous tumor model with fibrosis background. In
addition, using an in vitro model, we also demonstrated
that hepatoma cells treated by CM from SYY pretreated
aHSCs had reduced malignant potential, with altered
gene expression profile consisting of 1205 up-regulated
and 1323 down-regulated genes. We found that PI3K was
the key gene present in this altered gene profile. Further,
protein analysis showed that the PI3K related markers
such as PI3K AKT, pAKT, IGF1R, EGFR, TGF-β1,
VEGF, PDGF and MMP-2 were all down-regulated
significantly after SYY treatment in LX2.
In the present study, we demonstrated that SYY
could reduce liver cirrhosis and attenuate hepatic cancer
cell invasiveness and metastasis through the downregulation of cytokines secreted by activated hepatic
stellate cells. Our findings suggest that in future traditional
Chinese medicines, such as SYY, may provide novel
therapeutic approaches targeted to reduce liver cirrhosis
and prevent liver cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and animals
A highly metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma
cell line (HCCLM3), which originated from MHCC97H,
was established as previously described [26, 27]. Hep3B
from American Type Culture Collection was purchased
from the Chinese Academy of Science. Male BALB/c
nu/nu mice (aged 4–6 weeks and weighing approximately
20 g) were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Science
and maintained under standard pathogen-free conditions.
The animal use protocol was approved by the Shanghai
Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission.

dehydrogenase (LDH) activity released from damaged
cells. The aHSCs were cultured and removed from
the plates with trypsin digestion when the cell density
reached 80% confluence. The cells were then counted
and pipetted into 96-well plates at 1000 cells/well. The
same plate contained background controls (medium
only), low controls (spontaneous LDH release), high
controls (maximum LDH release) and experimental
samples (2 mg/ml SYY) which were prepared according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. These plates were
incubated in an incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4, 8,
12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Results were expressed as the mean
absorbance of wells in groups measured at 492 nm.
Cytotoxicity (%) was calculated using the equation:
(experimental value − low control) / (high control − low
control) × 100%.

Antibodies used for immunofluorescence,
immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemistry were as
follows: rabbit antihuman monoclonal α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit
anti-human monoclonal PI3K (Epitomics, Burlingame,
CA, USA), rabbit antihuman monoclonal AKT (CST),
rabbit antihuman monoclonal phosphorylated (p)-AKT
(CST, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit antihuman monoclonal
insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) (Abcam),
rabbit antihuman monoclonal epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) (Abcam), rabbit antihuman monoclonal
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (Abcam), rabbit
antihuman monoclonal vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) (Epitomics), rabbit antihuman monoclonal
platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) (Epitomics), rabbit
antihuman monoclonal MMP-2 (Epitomics) and rabbit
antihuman monoclonal proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) (Epitomics).

Cell proliferation and colony formation assay
aHSCs were cultured in 96-well plates
(3 × 103 cells/well) and exposed to SYY at increasing
concentrations for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Cell proliferation
assays were carried out with the Cell Counting Kit 8
(CCK8; Dojindo) and absorbance (OD) of each well noted
at 450 nm. For colony formation assays, LM3 and Hep3B
cells were cultured in 6-well plates (3 × 103 cells/well)
and cultured with DMEM and CM from aHSCs with or
without SYY (2 mg/mL). Culture medium was replaced
every 3 days, and the colonies were fixed with ice-cold 4%
paraformaldehyde 14 days after the initiation of treatment.
Cells were stained with Giemsa (Sigma) and photographed.

Characterization and preparation of
herbal extracts
The Chinese herbal medicine formula for SYY
is a dietary compound approved by the Chinese State
Food and Drug Administration (Grant No. G20070160)
that includes five Chinese medicinal herbal extracts
with a finger print of the following proportions (w/w):
Salviamiltiorrhiza Bge, 14.3%; Astragalus membranaceus
Bge, 14.3%; Lycium barbarum L, 23.8%; Crataegus
pinnatifida Bge, 23.8% and Trionyx sinensis Wiegmann,
23.8% (all from China) [11]. SYY, with the same batch
number (#20110401), used in vitro was produced by
Shanghai Fang Xin Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). The 800 mg/ml SYY preparation was
sterilized twice by filtration with 0.22 μm filter. (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). It was further prepared for in vitro
use as described previously [32].

Cell invasion assays
Cell invasion of HCCLM3 and Hep3B cell lines
were assessed by transwell assays (Boyden chambers;
Corning). Briefly, 80 μl matrigel (BD Biosciences) was
added to the upper chamber 6 h prior to seeding the
cells on the membrane. Subsequently, 6 × 104 cells were
seeded into the upper chamber of each well of 24-well
plates containing 8.0-μm pore size membranes. Serumfree DMEM, with or without SYY and aHSCs CM with
or without SYY were added to the lower chamber of each
well. After 48 h, cells that had crossed over to the underside
of the membrane were visualized by staining with Giemsa
(Sigma), and photographed at a magnification of 200 x.

Preparation of conditioned media (CM)
The aHSCs were cultured in high glucose
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing
10% (v/v) FBS in T25 flasks (1 × 105 cells) as previously
described [11]. The next day, cultures were removed and
12 ml fresh serum-free DMEM medium with SYY sample
(2 mg/ml) was added to SYY group, and fresh DMEM
medium was added to control sample (no SYY). 24 h
later, the cultures were centrifuged at 800 rpm and the
supernatants were collected. All cell culture reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen.

Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis
The expression of markers PCNA and α-SMA were
determined by immunofluorescence. Fibrotic hepatic
tissues were sliced, fixed, permeabilized, blocked and
incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies overnight
at 4°C. Slides were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit
Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson). Cells were
counterstained with 4–6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
to visualize cell nuclei and detected by fluorescence

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS
software version 10.0 for Windows software (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). As all groups showed normal
distribution, group differences were analyzed using
parametric statistical methods, paired independent sample
t-tests following one-way ANOVA. Data were presented
as mean ± standard deviation, P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Establishment of the nude mouse with liver fibrosis
Male BALB/c nu/nu mice (4–6 weeks old;
n = 30) received subcutaneous injection of 5 μl/g carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4/olive oil: 50:50) weekly. From the
fourth week of starting injection, 6 nude mice were
sacrificed every two weeks by spine dislocation to identify
the degree of fibrosis by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
and Sirius staining. Further, α-SMA was detected using
immunohistochemistry till the tenth week.
