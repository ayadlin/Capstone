ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a high-grade glioma with a complex microenvironment,
including various inflammatory cells and mast cells (MCs) as one of them. Previously
we had identified glioma grade-dependent MC recruitment. In the present study we
investigated the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in MC recruitment.
PAI-1, a primary regulator in the fibrinolytic cascade is capable of forming a
complex with fibrinolytic system proteins together with low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). We found that neutralizing PAI-1 attenuated
infiltration of MCs. To address the potential implication of LRP1 in this process, we
used a LRP1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), and demonstrated the
attenuation of MC migration. Moreover, a positive correlation between the number of
MCs and the level of PAI-1 in a large cohort of human glioma samples was observed.
Our study demonstrated the expression of LRP1 in human MC line LAD2 and in MCs in
human high-grade glioma. The activation of potential PAI-1/LRP1 axis with purified
PAI-1 promoted increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and subsequently exocytosis
in MCs.
These findings indicate the influence of the PAI-1/LRP1 axis on the recruitment
of MCs in glioma. The connection between high-grade glioma and MC infiltration could
contribute to patient tailored therapy and improve patient stratification in future
therapeutic trials.

INTRODUCTION

There are also additional experimental treatments, such
as passive and active immunotherapy, use of angiogenic
inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutics and
gene/antibody therapy [2]. Despite such aggressive
treatment, the prognosis for high-grade gliomas remains
among the poorest, with a median survival for patients
with GBM of just over one year [3].
The disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) as

The heterogeneity of high-grade gliomas in clinical
presentation, tumor location, growth pattern, response to
therapy and consequently patient outcome continues to
pose a challenge for clinical management [1]. Currently,
the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) involves maximal
safe surgery, followed by radiation and chemotherapy.

a result of abnormal neovasculature and redundant vessel
leakiness is one of the important hallmarks of GBM [4].
Another significant hallmark of GBM is its invasiveness
into surrounding brain parenchyma. During recent years,
the impact of microenvironment in tumor development
has become increasingly acknowledged [5]. Brain tumorassociated parenchymal cells such as vascular cells,
peripheral immune cells including microglia, myeloid
suppressor cells and T-regulatory cells play a vital role in
controlling the development of pathological conditions.
Glioma is capable of hiding signals important for immune
activation and subsequently ameliorating the environment
for immunosuppressive factors [6]. Addressing the
complexity of the unique glioma-immune cell interactions
represents a crucial aspect for the future therapy of glioma.
Mast cells (MCs) are key regulators of the tumor
microenvironment, affecting angiogenic processes,
immune modulation and tissue remodeling [7]. The role
of MCs in cancer is still controversial depending on the
type and malignancy grade of the cancer. We were first to
report that gliomas also contain MCs and we addressed the
role for different axes in chemotactic infiltration of MCs
into glioma [8, 9].
Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) or
SERPINE1, a primary regulator in the plasminogenplasmin system, is known as the principal inhibitor of
urokinase type plasminogen activators (uPA) and tissue
type plasminogen activators (tPA) by which it inhibits
plasminogen activation. It is also capable of forming
a complex with uPA and the uPA receptor (uPAR).
This complex can be removed from the cell surface by
binding with LRP1, followed by lysosomal degradation
of PA-PAI-1 complexes and reappearance of uPAR on
the cell surface, adjusting locomotion and the direction
of migration of cells [10]. Previous publications
demonstrated that overexpression of PAI-1 in GBM
is significantly correlated with shorter survival [11].
In addition, the PAI-1 serum level was shown to be a
predictive marker of glioma grade [12].
Here, we demonstrate that accumulation of MCs
correlates with the level of PAI-1 in glioma cells, and
also in tissue microarrays (TMAs) of a large cohort of
human high-grade glioma tissues. We show that PAI-1
neutralizing antibodies attenuated the infiltration of MCs.
Furthermore, to address the potential implication of lowdensity lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in
this process, we demonstrated the expression of LRP1
in LAD2 cells but also revealed the presence of LRP1
in MCs in human high-grade glioma tissue. To properly
assess the role of LRP1 in MC migration, we used a
LRP1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), and
demonstrated the attenuation of MC migration upon LRP1
blocking. In addition, the activation of potential PAI-1/
LRP1 axis with purified PAI-1 promoted differential
phosphorylation of a number of signaling molecules
including significant upregulation of pSTAT3, which, in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

turn, mediated MC exocytosis.
In conclusion, the present investigation reveals a
potential mechanism by which the recruitment of MCs to
glioma is mediated by tumor derived PAI-1. Our findings
implicate the interaction between PAI-1 and the newly
identified MC receptor LRP1 in pSTAT3 dependent MC
exocytosis.

RESULTS
High SERPINE1/PAI 1 expression in human
glioma correlates with low survival rate
We have earlier shown [9] that glioma derived
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent
chemoattractant for MCs. Another mediator that was
highly expressed by glioma cells is PAI-1/SERPINE1.
The recent classification of GBM has been given
by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network. Based
on gene expression patterns for signature genes, genomic
abnormalities and gene expression alterations in genes
such as EGFR, NF1 and PDGFRA/IDH1, the TCGA
GBM samples were classified in four subtypes, Proneural,
Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal [13]. In order to
assess the potential correlation between SERPINE1
signaling in human GBM we analyzed the TCGA dataset
of 518 GBM patient samples and found a significant
upregulation of SERPINE1 (data not shown). We used
the well-established markers EGFR and PTEN as positive
and negative controls for upregulated and downregulated
expression in human GBM, respectively. To assess the
correlation between SERPINE1 expression and patient
survival we analyzed the TCGA GBM dataset consisting
of 518 GBM patients for which transcriptome and survival
data is available. First, we sorted the TCGA patients by
SERPINE1 expression from high to low and performed
a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compare the top
25% patients (with high expression) and the bottom
25% of patients (with low expression). This analysis
showed a statistically significant difference in survival
between the two groups (Figure 1A, log-rank p-value =
0.011). Further inspection of these groups showed that
83% of the patients with high SERPINE1 expression are
of Mesenchymal subtype (MS) and 29% of the patients
with low SERPINE1 values are of Proneural subtype
(PN) (Figure 1C). To investigate this further, we selected,
based on SERPINE1 expression (high or low), the top
25% and bottom 25% of patient samples within MS and
PN subgroups, respectively, and performed a survival
analysis between the resulting four groups. As shown in
Figure 1B we found a statistically significant survival
difference between the PN subgroup with low SERPINE1
expression (longer survival) and the other three (MS high/
low SERPINE1 and PN high SERPINE1 expression).

The extent of MC recruitment is correlated with
the level of PAI-1 in human high-grade glioma

Patient-derived glioma cell cultures used in this
study are part of the Uppsala University Human Glioma
Cell Culture (HGCC) collection that comprises wellcharacterized GBM-derived cell cultures (Xie et al 2015,
submitted). A survival analysis based on the HGCC
data was inconclusive owing to low sample numbers in
comparison to the number of patients in the TCGA dataset.
We chose cell lines from the HGCC database with high
and low SERPINE1 expression (Figure 1D) from both
Mesenchymal and Proneural subtypes to continue our
investigation.

We have previously shown that the number of MCs
in human glioma is dependent on malignancy grade. We
identified PAI-1 as a highly expressed glioma-derived
candidate [9], whose elevated expression in GBM has been
demonstrated to be associated with short survival [11]. In
addition, our in vitro data demonstrated a chemoattractant
role of PAI-1 towards MCs. Therefore we proceeded with
our studies by performing tissue analysis of the number
of infiltrating MCs and SERPINE1 expression in human
high-grade glioma TMAs.
PAI-1 is a widely expressed protein in glioma
tissues, which resulted in a strong and widespread
cytoplasmic staining when immunohistochemistry was
performed (data not shown). The extent of intense and
diffused staining made it unsuitable for quantification of
PAI-1 in the glioma TMAs. Therefore, to investigate the
potential correlation between the populations of GBM
cells expressing SERPINE1 and the presence of MCs,
we used RNA-in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) on highgrade glioma TMA’s. Analysis of consecutive sections of
the TMAs revealed a correlation between the number of
infiltrating MCs and the relative staining intensity for PAI1 (Figure 3A). Thus negative staining was associated with
low MC numbers (0-5 MCs per TMA core) in all cases (n
= 25). The proportion of TMA cores with low numbers of
MCs was 57% (n = 32) among those with medium PAI1 expression. The proportion of MCs between medium
MC numbers (6-20 MC/TMA core) and high (≥21 MC/
TMA core) numbers in TMA cores with medium PAI-1
expression was calculated as 35% (n = 20) and 7% (n = 4)
respectively. The proportion of TMA cores exhibiting low
numbers of MCs was lowest with high PAI-1 expression.
These values were 29% (n = 5) for low MC numbers,
41% (n = 7) with medium and 29% (n = 5) with high MC
numbers of high PAI-1 expressing samples. Representative
positive and negative staining for MCs and PAI-1 is
illustrated in left panel of Figure 3A.
A Spearman’s correlation analysis comparing the
MC numbers and PAI-1 expression showed positive
correlation between them (Figure 3B). So we can
conclude that high PAI-1 expression in the glioma tissue
is associated with MC infiltration.

Glioma derived PAI-1 promotes MC recruitment
Previously we demonstrated that human glioma
cells secrete a number of mediators among which MIF
promotes human MC recruitment [9]. Here we investigated
the role of another candidate, PAI-1, which is highly
secreted by glioma cells. Previous studies have shown
that overexpression of PAI-1 in GBM is significantly
correlated with shorter survival [11] and, that PAI-1 serum
level could be attributed as a predictive marker for glioma
grade [12]. Using microarray expression data and a larger
cohort of 518 patients from the TCGA, we found that there
is a statistically significant difference in survival between
patients with low versus high PAI-1 levels (Figure 1A).
Therefore, we decided to study the chemotactic capacity
of PAI-1 by attempting to block MC chemotaxis by
inhibiting PAI-1. As shown in Figure 2A, neutralization
of the PAI-1 in U2987MG-conditioned medium with
antibodies significantly lowered the motility of LAD2
MCs. A reduction of migration was even more pronounced
when both MIF and PAI-1 in the conditioned medium
were blocked (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, the
levels of PAI-1 in patient-derived glioma cell supernatants
as compared to U2987MG were verified by using ELISA
in both Proneural (U3016MG, U3047MG, U3117MG)
and Mesenchymal (U3065MG, U3060MG, U3062MG,
U3101MG) subtypes with previously identified low
(U3016MG, U3047MG, U3065MG) and high (U3117MG,
U3101MG, U3060MG, U3062MG) mRNA level of PAI1 (Figure 2B). We further extended our study of LAD2
cell migration using high and low PAI-1 expressing
patient-derived glioma cell lines from the Proneural and
Mesenchymal subtypes. A direct correlation between
subtype of glioma cells, level of PAI-1 and migration of
LAD2 cells was observed, being highest in Mesenchymal
subtype with high level of PAI-1 expression and lowest
in Proneural subtype with low level of PAI-1 expression
(Figure 2C).

Identification of LRP1 expression in MCs in
human glioma and LAD2 cells is associated with
their recruitment towards glioma-derived PAI-1
MCs express a variety of both cell surface as well as
transmembrane receptors. However, none of the receptors
was identified to interact with PAI-1 as yet. PAI-1 can bind
to various matrix components e.g., vitronectin and LRP1,
leading to dramatic consequences on their migratory

phenotype [14]. In addition, previous publications
demonstrated that PAI-1 stimulates macrophage motility
in a LRP1 dependent manner [15].
LRP1, one of the largest members of the LDLR
family is synthesized as a 600 kDa precursor protein and
processed in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like protease to
yield a 515 kDa alpha-chain and an 85 kDa beta-chain
that associates non-covalently [16]. The alpha chain
contains four ligand-binding domains (clusters I-IV).
We hypothesized that LRP1 is expressed on MCs and
mediates MC motility towards glioma derived PAI-1. We
identified LRP1 expression on LAD2 cells by observing
the co-localization of LRP1 with human MC tryptase
(hTPS) (Figure 4A). Similar staining was performed on
human glioma tissue demonstrating the LRP1 expression
on MCs in vivo (Figure 4B). To confirm the constitutive
expression of LRP1 in MCs we stimulated LAD2 cells
with PAI-1 enriched medium and then performed

western blot (Supplementary Figure 2A) and RT-PCR
(Supplementary Figure 2B) on LAD2 cells. The level of
LRP1 expression was not altered and was consistent with
or without stimulation by PAI-1, confirming that LAD2
cells express LRP1 constitutively.
To validate the importance of LRP1 in mediating
MC’s migratory capacity towards glioma-derived PAI1, a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family
blocker, receptor associated protein (RAP) was used to
block LRP1 in LAD2 cells. RAP has been shown to bind
with high affinity to cluster III of LRP1 [17]. The results
demonstrated that migration of RAP pre-treated LAD2
cells towards PAI-1 enriched medium was significantly
reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C), being
in line with our hypothesis that PAI-1 induces migration
of LAD2 cells in a LRP1 dependent manner.

Identification of direct interaction between PAI-1
and LRP1 in human glioma tissue by proximity
ligation assay

ligation assay (PLA) was used to detect binding of PAI1 with LRP1 in glioma tissue. Positive co-localization
signals (Figure 5A-5B) were abundant throughout the
tumor tissue. To ascertain MC distribution/presence in
the vicinity, the tissues were counter-stained with human
MC specific protease, tryptase (hTPS) (Figure 5A-5B).
We were able to detect that PAI-1 indeed binds to LRP1
in human glioma tissue attributing, to a certain extent,
these interactions with LRP1 on MCs. Hence, these data
elucidate an in vivo attractant role for PAI-1 leading to the
observed high accumulation of MCs in glioma.

According to the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)
database, both PAI-1 and LRP1 are highly expressed
proteins in glioma tissues (www.proteinatlas.org).
Considering that LRP1 is expressed on other cell types
in glioma in addition to MCs, we wanted to ascertain in
vivo interaction of LRP1 and PAI-1in MCs. Proximity

PAI-1 promotes phosphorylation of STAT3 and
regulation of exocytosis in MCs

the constitutive expression of LRP1 in LAD2 cells
demonstrated in Supplementary Figure 2.
The analysis of histamine release (Figure 6C) and
TNF-alpha secretion (Figure 6D) by LAD2 cells after
Stattic treatment demonstrated a significant decrease in
both assays indicating an inhibition of MC exocytosis
when STAT3 activation is hampered. Hence it is
evident that PAI-1 stimulates active migration of MCs
which, in turn, activates signaling cascades leading to
STAT3 phosphorylation and, subsequently, causes MC
degranulation in the tissue, thereby may trigger infiltration
of other immune cells, development of angiogenesis and
other modulation of the tumor microenvironment.

A phosphokinase array was used to identify possible
targets downstream of signaling pathways induced by PAI1. Protein lysates from PAI-1 stimulated LAD2 cells were
analyzed by this array and revealed intense augmentation
of the intracellular level of phosphorylated STAT3
(pSTAT3) as compared to control medium (Figure 6A).
STAT3 has been shown to be involved in MC
functions by induction of various regulatory genes and
its phosphorylation linked to MC exocytosis [18]. To test
the potential role of STAT3 in MC exocytosis, Stattic,
a nonpeptidic small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, was
used [19]. LAD2 cells were pretreated with Stattic for 2
hours prior to stimulation by glioma-derived conditioned
medium. The calcium ionophore A23187 was used as a
positive stimulant of LAD2 cells. Western blotting verified
the significant blocking of STAT3 phosphorylation by
Stattic (Figure 6B). We also found that the level of
LRP1 in the LAD2 cells remained unaltered (Figure 6B)
after treatment with Stattic. This result further supports

DISCUSSION
The dependence of cancer growth on the
reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and tumor
microenvironment is increasingly recognized. Glioma
microenvironment accommodates a diversity of cell
types and a plethora of complex interactions between
them. Inflammatory cells have been connected to tumor

development by mediating the inflammatory response,
which is critical for tumor formation.
Gliomas are infiltrated by a variety of immune
cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems.
However, the correlation between these immune
infiltrates and clinical outcome is controversial, leaving
their role debatable and requiring more efforts in further
investigations [20]. Despite the fact that the prevailing
role for glioma-associated immune cells remains

protumorigenic, it cannot be excluded that the functional
plasticity of immune cells is dependent on multiple
microenvironmental cues. These cues for example can be
generated by immune cells and depend on the severity of
glioma.
In our previous studies we demonstrated recruitment
of MCs upon glioma development [8]. We also identified
several glioma-secreted factors, which appeared to be
crucial for MC recruitment [9]. One of the candidates

identified was PAI-1. Considering previously shown direct
correlation between overexpressed PAI-1 and the survival
in GBM [11], and also its role in being potential serum
marker in the prediction of glioma grade [12], we decided
to focus our research on PAI-1.
Previous studies of the plasminogen-plasmin
system in cancer suggested the importance of this system
in facilitating tumor cell invasion by uPA-mediated
activation of plasmin and subsequent degradation of
extracellular matrix [21]. PAI-1 is the unique and specific
inhibitor of both tPA and uPA [22] and thus expected to
prevent plasmin generation. However, recent studies have
brought forward another set of functions that are distinct
from original function of uPA/PAI-1. These observations
revealed that high PAI-1 expression is an indicator of
poor prognosis in many cancers, suggesting the ambiguity
of definition of PAI-1 as tumoricidal [10]. It was also
demonstrated that there are nonproteolytic properties of
PAI-1, including interactions with integrins, inhibition
of apoptosis and promotion of tumor cell proliferation. It
indicates the importance of other factors, including PAI1 concentration, location, type of tumor, and presence
of receptors, and not only the impact of PAI-1 induced
proteolytic actions of plasmin.
The analysis of the TCGA GBM dataset revealed
significant upregulation of SERPINE1 (PAI-1). KaplanMeier survival curves using the TCGA GBM dataset
showed a significant difference in survival between
patients with high versus low SERPINE1 expression.
Further investigation of subtype-specific expression of
SERPINE1 showed that the predominant subtype among
the patients with highest SERPINE1 expression levels is
the Mesenchymal subtype, while the Proneural subtype
is predominant among patients with lowest SERPINE1
levels. Moreover, the survival analysis between the top/
bottom 25% of patients within the Mesenchymal and
Proneural subtypes showed that patients of Proneural
subtype with low SERPINE1 levels have a statistically
significant increase in survival compared with the other
three groups. Based on these observations we hypothesized
that PAI-1 expression could initiate MC migration in a
subtype specific manner and eventually affect the role of
MC in glioma development. To test this hypothesis we
used the panel of patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines
from the HGCC biobank with transcriptome data and
assigned subtypes. The expression of SERPINE1 in this
sample set mirrors the expression in the TCGA dataset,
being highest in cell cultures of Mesenchymal subtype
and lowest in the cell cultures of Proneural subtype. This
demonstrated that given cell cultures are suitable models
for studies of SERPINE1-related mechanisms in GBM
biology.
In this study we identified PAI-1 as an important
attractant of MCs in glioma. Moreover, on the basis of
the TCGA and HGCC datasets we undertook a functional
screen of the panel of patient-derived glioma primary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell cultures and confirmed the functional connection
between glioma subtype dependent PAI-1 expression and
MC migratory properties. LRP1 is known for its multiple
functions in endocytosis and in signal transduction that
allows it to activate inflammatory signaling pathways.
Previous publications showed that LRP1 is capable of
stimulating cytokine production by inflammatory cells
and induce cell migration [23]. We are first to identify the
LRP1 expression in MCs in both LAD2 cells and human
gliomas and show that LRP1 was critical for accumulation
of MCs towards PAI-1 expressing glioma cells. The
neutralization of PAI-1 activation significantly attenuated
MC migration. However, residual chemoattractant activity
toward MCs was present even after adding the PAI1 blocking antibody, suggesting the role for other MC
chemoattractants. Indeed, MC migration was hindered
even more noticeably when both MIF and PAI-1 blocking
antibodies were added, suggesting a critical role for these
chemoattractants in MC migration. Regulation of MC
recruitment to gliomas by PAI-1 is supported further
by our TMA data demonstrating a positive correlation
between the level of PAI-1 mRNA expression and the
number of intratumoral MCs.
At the same time PAI-1 promoted differential
phosphorylation of a number of signaling molecules
in MCs, including substantial enhancement of STAT3
phosphorylation and, subsequently, resulting in increased
MC exocytosis. STAT3 plays a crucial role in tumor
microenvironment. It propagates several levels of
crosstalk between tumor cells and their immunological
microenvironment. The activated STAT3 stimulates tumor
stromal immune cells, whose recruitment promotes tumor
progression [24, 25]. Our data is in line with the recent
publications demonstrating the role for activated STAT3 in
immunologically mediated MC exocytosis [18].
In conclusion, we demonstrated that glioma-derived
PAI-1, inducing recruitment of MCs also mediates MC
degranulation, releasing numerous MC mediators, which
participate in glioma fate. These findings shed new light
on the molecular basis of the interplay between glioma
cells and MCs and eventually emphasize the impact of
MCs upon glioma progression.

U3062MG and U3101MG cells were cultured on laminin
(10mg/ml) in serum-free (stem cell) conditions, to enrich
for stem-like glioma cells, as described previously [29].
The human MC line LAD2 (obtained from Prof
Dean Metcalfe at NIH/NIAID, MD, USA) was cultured
as described previously [30] in StemPro medium
supplemented with 4mM L-glutamine, 100units/ml
penicillin and 0.1mg/ml streptomycin and 100ng/ml SCF
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).

plate for 4 hours. Stimulation experiment was done in
duplicates. Supernatants were collected for histamine and
TNF-α ELISA. The calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma
Aldrich, St Loius, USA) was used as a positive control for
stimulation. Supernatant from cells that were not treated
neither with U2987MG medium or Stattic was used as
unstimulated control.

Western blot
Efficacy of Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) inhibition
on LAD2 cells as well as presence of LRP1 on LAD2
cells was confirmed using western blotting, as described
elsewhere [29]. The primary antibodies used were directed
against pSTAT3 (1:1000, Cell Signalling Technology,
Danvers, MA), LRP1 (1: 5000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
and β-actin (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, St Loius, USA).

Transwell migration assays
All migration experiments were carried out in a
24-well culture plates using transwells with 5µm PET
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). To evaluate the
capacity of glioma cells to recruit MCs, conditioned
media from confluent U2987MG, U3016MG, U3047MG,
U3117MG, U3065MG, U3060MG, U3062MG and
U3101MG cells were used as the chemoattractant with
unconditioned media serving as controls. LAD2 cells were
starved of SCF overnight, resuspended in control medium
(5 x 104 cells/ml), then allowed to migrate through
transwells overnight and thereafter counted. Migration of
MCs toward U2987MG-conditioned medium was set to
100%. These experiments were performed in triplicates
and repeated at least 3 times.
Neutralizing experiments were performed in
triplicates as described previously [8] with PAI-1 antibody
concentration of 50µg/ml (R&D Systems, Abingdon,
UK) and MIF antibody concentration of 50µg/ml (R&D
Systems, Abingdon, UK). Control samples were incubated
under same conditions with a matching isotype nonspecific
IgG antibody (50 µg/ml; R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).
The selection of concentration range for PAI-1 neutralizing
antibody was based on suggestion by manufacturers as
determined by its ability to neutralize recombinant human
PAI-1.
For blocking of LRP1 activity, cells were pretreated
with two different concentrations (25µM and 50µM) of
LRP1 antagonist RAP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 30
min prior to migration studies.

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from control LAD2 cells grown
in different medium as well as from LAD2 cells after
stimulation. RNA extraction was done using TRIzol® (Life
Technologies, Waltham, MA) extraction method from cell
pellets. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript® II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), which
was then used to perform the PCR using the KAPA2G
Fast PCR Kit (Kapabiosystems, MA, USA) to demonstrate
LRP1 in LAD2 cells. The primers used for LRP1 in PCR
are as follows: 5´-ACATATAGCCTCCATCCTAATC-3´
and 5´-TTCCAATCTCCACGTTCAT-3´.

Phospho-kinase array
The human phospho-kinase array kit that allows for
simultaneous detection of the changes in relative levels of
phosphorylation of 46 kinase phosphorylation sites (R&D
Systems; Abingdon, UK) was used in accordance with
the manufacturer’s directions. In brief, LAD2 cells grown
overnight in the absence of serum were placed for 10-15
min in medium from confluent 96-h cultures of U2987MG
cells or control medium with or without PAI-1 (1ng/ml
and 10ng/ml). Lysates were prepared and applied to
membranes overnight, after which signals were detected as
described above after appropriate application of antibody
cocktails and streptavidin-HRP solutions.
Quantification and analysis of the data was done
using the ImageJ (NIH) software. Since capture antibodies
are spotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane in duplicates,
for quantification of both arrays, the pixel intensity of each
spot was calculated, integrated and corrected for background and the resulting average values from duplicate
spots plotted. Integrated pixel intensity was determined
for each spot, corrected for background and the resulting

Inhibition and stimulation assays
To examine the effect of STAT3 on MC exocytosis,
LAD2 cells were pre-treated with Stattic (Sigma Aldrich,
St Loius, USA) an inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation,
at a concentration of 80µM for 30 min at 37°C. The
concentration of Stattic used was chosen based on
previous publications [18] and published kinetic study
experiments [19, 31]. Following this the LAD2 cells were
stimulated with U2987MG media in a 24-well culture

pretreated with citrate buffer and protease as instructed
by the manufacturers. The slides were then hybridized
sequentially with target probes, pre-amplifiers and
amplifiers. The detection was done by the kits enhanced
intense Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining system
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. The slides
were mounted permanently.
A Hs-SERPINE1 probe (ACD-555961) was used
to demonstrate expression of SERPINE1 RNA molecules
in the glioma TMAs. Appropriate negative control probes
was used as background control. Stained slides were
scanned using the methods of The Human Protein Atlas
project at ×40 magnification (www.proteinatlas.org) [32,
33]. Quantification of the RNA expression was done using
the ImageJ software (NIH).

In vitro measurement of histamine release and
TNF-α secretion
Following stimulation of LAD2 cells with
U2987MG-conditioned medium, the histamine levels
(Oxford Biomedical Research, MI, USA) and TNF-α
levels (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) in the media
was measured by sandwich ELISA following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Both ELISA were done in
triplicates for each stimulation assay.

PAI-1 ELISA

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
staining

PAI-1 levels in glioma cell supernatants and
medium controls were measured by ELISA according
to manufacturer’s guidelines (Human PAI-1 Quantikine
ELISA, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) on three replicates
of 96 hours conditioned medium.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 6 µm thick
tissue sections were fixed. Thereafter, the sections were
deparaffinized (in xylene overnight, in fresh xylene for 1
h on a rocking table followed by 2 x 5 min incubations
in 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 80% EtOH, distilled H2O)
and subjected to pressure boiling for antigen retrieval in
antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs, Burlingame,
CA).
Immunohistochemistry was performed using
the UltraVision LP detection System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after antigen retrieval
the slides were washed in PBS-T (containing 0.05%
Tween (Sigma Aldrich, St Loius, USA) and incubated
with hydrogen peroxidase block. Ultra V block was
subsequently applied. Primary antibody used was antihuman tryptase (hTPS) (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa-Cruz, USA) diluted in 5% milk in PBS-T. Primary
antibody was applied overnight at 4°C, followed by
primary antibody enhancer. Slides were incubated with
HRP polymer and the signal was visualized using freshly
prepared DAB plus chromogen and substrate mix.
Between all the steps described above, the slides were
thoroughly washed in PBS-T. After the final step, the
slides were washed in distilled H2O, counterstained with
hematoxylin and mounted using Immu-mount (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The slides were scanned
using the methods of The Human Protein Atlas project
(www.proteinatlas.org).
For immunofluorescence staining, slides were
rinsed in PBS, blocked in 5% milk-containing PBS-Tx
(supplemented with 0.2% Triton-X 100 (Sigma Aldrich, St
Loius, USA)) for 1 hour, followed by overnight incubation
(4°C) with the primary antibody diluted in the blocking
solution. The following antibodies with the specific
dilutions were used: LRP1 (1:250, Abcam, Cambridge,

Human tissue samples and tissue microarrays
Informed consent for the use of human brain tissue
and for access to medical records for research purposes
was obtained, and all material obtained in compliance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The experiments involving
human tissue samples were approved both by the Ethics
Committee of Uppsala University (Application Dnr Ups
02-330 and Ups 06-084) and the Ethics Committee of
Karolinska Institutet (Application Dnr Ki 02-254) and
written informed consent was solicited prior to collection
of these samples. Human tissue samples were obtained
from Uppsala Biobank material. High-grade gliomas
had been graded based on the WHO classification by
experienced neuropathologist.
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and slide scanning were
performed using the strategies of The Human Protein Atlas
project (www.proteinatlas.org) [32, 33]. TMAs involved
tumor tissue from high-grade gliomas (anaplastic gliomas
and glioblastomas, n = 101).

In situ hybridization
To identify the possible correlation between PAI1 expression in high-grade gliomas and MC numbers,
in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to visualize
single RNA molecules (PAI-1) per cell in glioma tissue
samples. ISH was performed on high-grade glioma
TMAs using RNAscope technology (Advanced Cell
Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). The protocol described with
the RNAscope® 2.0 High Definition (HD)—BROWN
Assay kit was followed strictly throughout the experiment.
Briefly, the FFPE TMA sections were deparaffinized and

UK), PAI-1 (1:200 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa-Cruz,
USA), hTPS (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SantaCruz, USA). The slides were subsequently incubated with
appropriate secondary antibody for 45 min. Nuclei was
stained with DAPI (1:5000) for 15 min and mounted in
Immu-mount. All secondary antibodies used were Alexa
antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Pictures were
taken using Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope and
Zen software (version 5.0, 2008). Where applicable,
maximum intensity projection was performed on z-stack
images.

Statistical analyses were done using the Graphpad
Prism software (GraphPad Sowtware 6.0d). For groupwise comparisons the Student’s unpaired t-test was used.
For comparisons between more than two groups ANOVA
was applied. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used
for the TCGA and HGCC data and was performed with
censoring at confidence interval 95%. The p values for the
survival analysis are for the log-rank test.

Survival analysis was done using the TCGA GBM
data downloaded from the cBio and TCGA portals.
SERPINE1 TCGA expression data (TCGA provisional,
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
Array, for 528 patients) [34] was downloaded from the
cBio Portal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Clinical data for
the TCGA patients was obtained from the TCGA portal
and in each case the maximum value of the survival times
reported for a patient was used. Transcriptome data for the
HGCC collection was generated on Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays, RMA normalized and
transformed in z-scores. HGCC cell lines were classified
based on their expression profile for known signature
genes [13] using known TCGA subtypes as reference and a
k-nearest neighbor algorithm as described elsewhere (Xie
et al. 2015, manuscript submitted). All data manipulations
were done in R [35].
